&lt; p &gt; This is the first report to examine the cost to the 50 states of public assistance programs for working families .
We examine working families <unk> of the health care programs Medicaid and <unk> Health Insurance Program ( <unk> ) , as well as their enrollment in the basic household income assistance program Temporary <unk> to <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) .
Both of these programs operate with shared funding from the federal government and the states , and in this report we also examine the costs to the federal government of Medicaid / <unk> and <unk> , as well as the <unk> Income Tax Credit ( <unk> ) and the food <unk> program ( <unk> <unk> <unk> Program , or <unk> ) .
Our analysis includes only the cash assistance portion of <unk> , and it does not include costs for state <unk> Income Tax <unk> , child care assistance , or other <unk> <unk> programs .
<unk> , we find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year on these four programs for working families and the states <unk> spent $ 25 billion per year on Medicaid / <unk> and <unk> for working families for a total of $ <unk> billion per year .
In all , more than half &quot; <unk> percent &quot; of combined state and federal spending on public assistance goes to working families .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> &lt; p &gt; We define working families as those that have at least one family member who works 27 or more weeks per year and 10 or more hours per week .
To calculate the cost to the federal and state governments of public assistance programs for working families , we mainly rely on two sources of data : the March <unk> of the U.S. <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) from 2010 &quot; 2012 and administrative data from the Medicaid , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> programs for <unk> 2009 &quot; 10 .
All amounts are adjusted to and reported in 2013 dollars .
Medicaid figures exclude aged , blind , and disabled <unk> .
Our calculation method is described in the <unk> .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant changes in Medicaid enrollment since implementation of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , but these change are not <unk> in this analysis because the data is not yet available .
A key provision of the ACA , adopted by 28 states and Washington <unk> , expanded Medicaid coverage starting in <unk> to <unk> adults under age 65 including those without children living at home , with the federal government paying 100 percent of the cost through 2016 .
In addition , enrollment in &quot; traditional &quot; Medicaid &quot; that is , among those who had been previously eligible &quot; has also been <unk> , in both expansion and <unk> states , due to the individual mandate to obtain health insurance , as well as increased <unk> , awareness , and system improvements to Medicaid related to the ACA , particularly since the opening of the health care <unk> in October <unk> These costs will be shared by the federal government and the states as determined under traditional Medicaid <unk> .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> <unk> and Public <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; <unk> on public assistance can be found among workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations with particularly high levels of public assistance program <unk> that have been recently <unk> are <unk> fast food workers , 7 child care providers , 8 and home care <unk> of these have at or near 50 percent of their workforce in families with at least one family member <unk> on a public assistance program .
&lt; p &gt; However , high <unk> on public assistance programs among workers is n &apos;t found only in service occupations .

Among Medicaid / <unk> <unk> , <unk> million were workers and their <unk> ; this <unk> well over half ( <unk> percent ) of the programs overall enrollment .
<unk> , the <unk> program , had <unk> million <unk> who were workers and their <unk> , <unk> almost <unk> ( 32 percent ) of all program <unk> .
The <unk> million working families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> percent ) of total <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> program had <unk> million working families receiving assistance , <unk> 36 percent of the total program enrollment .
There is significant <unk> in enrollment in these programs , and we are not able to determine with this data the total number of <unk> in these four programs combined .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> &lt; p &gt; <unk> Federal <unk> &lt; p &gt; Table 2 ( page 4 ) details the expenses at the federal level of the four public assistance programs , and the portions of the program <unk> that went to working families .
<unk> , between 2009 and 2011 the federal government spent $ <unk> billion ( in 2013 dollars ) <unk> on these programs , with <unk> percent &quot; that is , $ <unk> billion &quot; going to working families .
&lt; p &gt; More than half ( 55 percent ) of the federal Medicaid / <unk> annual <unk> &quot; $ <unk> billion &quot; went to workers and their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of federal <unk> funds ( $ <unk> billion <unk> ) were used to assist working families .

&lt; p &gt; <unk> State <unk> &lt; p &gt; <unk> , states <unk> spent $ 25 billion <unk> between 2009 and 2011 to fund public assistance health programs and provide cash assistance to working families ( see Table 3 , page 4 ) .
This represented over half ( 52 percent ) of total <unk> funding for the two programs .
&lt; p &gt; As shown in Table 3 , per year the states <unk> spent $ <unk> billion on the health programs Medicaid and <unk> .
Out of this , $ <unk> billion &quot; <unk> percent &quot; was used to fund these health programs for members of working families .
Looking at <unk> , $ <unk> billion ( 27 percent ) of the $ <unk> billion cash assistance provided by the states went to working families .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; The <unk> findings on public assistance program enrollment , and the findings on <unk> by the federal government as well as the 50 states combined , offer a big picture of the hidden cost of <unk> work in America .
Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each individual state .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> &lt; p &gt; Table 4 ( page 6 ) provides a <unk> break out of the program enrollment numbers for Medicaid / <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .

&lt; h &gt; <unk> &lt; p &gt; Federal <unk> by State &lt; p &gt; Table 5 ( page 7 ) breaks out the data in Table 2 , showing the annual federal cost for the four public assistance programs by state .
( Note that the numbers in Table 2 are presented in <unk> of dollars , while the numbers in Table 5 are presented in millions of dollars . )
States with the highest percentage of their federal public assistance dollars going to working families include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , New <unk> , North <unk> , <unk> , Texas , and <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> State <unk> &lt; p &gt; Finally , Table 6 ( page 8 ) breaks out the data in Table 3 , showing each states annual <unk> on Medicaid / <unk> and <unk> for working families ( 2013 dollars ) .
Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual state .
&lt; p &gt; The states with the highest <unk> cost of <unk> work ( over $ 1 billion ) were California ( $ <unk> million ) , New York ( $ <unk> million ) , Texas ( $ <unk> million ) , <unk> ( $ <unk> million ) , and <unk> ( $ <unk> million ) .
States with the highest percentage of their public assistance funds going to working families &quot; in each instance over 60 percent &quot; were New <unk> , Texas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
&lt; h &gt; Child Care <unk> and Working <unk> &lt; p &gt; This report does not include all of the public assistance programs supported by federal and state dollars , because the data available on these other programs does not allow for the type of analysis we <unk> .
The largest programs not examined are those that provide funding for child care <unk> to <unk> families .
In 2013 , total child care funding included : $ <unk> billion in federal <unk> funds spent directly on child care $ <unk> billion in additional state <unk> <unk> of <unk> ( <unk> ) $ <unk> billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( <unk> ) <unk> Child care funding is <unk> <unk> on working families .
A 2014 <unk> Institute study found that at least <unk> percent of families receiving child care <unk> have a member of the family that <unk> Only a fraction of those eligible for child care <unk> currently receive them .
According to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Service analysis of 2011 data , 13 among children eligible under federal rules only 17 percent received <unk> care , and among children eligible under state rules just 29 percent received <unk> care .
<unk> wages would allow for a broader distribution of the available funding across families in need of assistance .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> &lt; p &gt; When jobs do n &apos;t pay enough , workers turn to public assistance in order to meet their basic needs .
These programs provide vital support to millions of working families whose employers pay less than a <unk> wage .
At both the state and federal levels , more than half of total spending on the public assistance programs <unk> in this report &quot; Medicaid / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and food <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in <unk> health insurance would result in significant Medicaid savings that states and the federal government could apply to other programs and <unk> In the case of <unk> &quot; a block grant that includes maintenance of effort ( <unk> ) provisions that require specified state spending &quot; higher wages would allow states to reduce the portion of the program going to cash assistance while increasing the funding for other services such as child care , job training , and transportation assistance .
<unk> wages would also significantly reduce federal <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , higher wages and employer provided health care would lower both state and federal public assistance costs , and allow all levels of government to better target how their tax dollars are used .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> : <unk> &lt; p &gt; To calculate the cost to state governments of public assistance programs for working families ( defined as having at least one family member who works 27 or more weeks per year and 10 or more hours per week ) , we mainly rely on two sources of data : the March <unk> of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and administrative data from the Medicaid , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and food <unk> programs .
Medicaid figures exclude aged , blind , and disabled <unk> .
The March <unk> , also known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> , asks <unk> about <unk> of cash and <unk> transfer payments during the past year and includes questions about the programs we examined in this analysis .
&lt; p &gt; To create the cost and enrollment estimates for Medicaid , <unk> , and <unk> we use the <unk> to calculate the share of program <unk> and the share of individual program <unk> who live in working families .
We then apply those shares to the <unk> individual enrollment and program cost <unk> provided in the administrative data to obtain the number of <unk> and total <unk> on <unk> from working families .
For Medicaid and <unk> , we calculate each state governments share of <unk> by applying the states Federal Medical <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) .
The <unk> administrative data break out each states <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; To create the cost and enrollment estimates for <unk> and <unk> , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> match the administrative data .
We then sum the number of enrolled families ( defined as having at least one family member participating in a program ) and the cost of their benefits to obtain the total program enrollment and cost .
We then repeat this process using only working families ( defined as above ) to obtain our total enrollment and cost for working families .

&lt; h &gt; Executive Summary &lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> ( <unk> percent ) of <unk> in <unk> major public benefits programs are from working families .
But many of them work in jobs that pay wages so low that their <unk> do not generate enough income to provide for <unk> basic <unk> .
Low wages paid by employers in the fast-food industry create especially <unk> problems for the families of workers in this industry .
<unk> pay for core <unk> fast-food jobs is $ <unk> an hour , with many jobs paying at or near the minimum wage .
<unk> are also <unk> for <unk> fast-food workers ; an estimated <unk> percent do not receive health benefits through their employer .
The combination of low wages and benefits , often <unk> with <unk> employment , means that many of the families of fast-food workers must rely on <unk> safety net programs to make ends meet .
&lt; p &gt; This report estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Medicaid , the <unk> Income Tax Credit and the other public benefits programs discussed in this report provide a vital support system for millions of Americans working in the United States service industries , including fast food .
We analyze public program <unk> by working families and estimate total average annual public benefit <unk> on the families of <unk> fast-food workers for the years <unk> For this analysis we focus on jobs held by core , <unk> fast-food workers , defined as <unk> workers who work at least 11 hours per week for 27 or more weeks per year .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; More than half ( 52 percent ) of the families of <unk> fast-food workers are enrolled in one or more public programs , compared to 25 percent of the workforce as a whole .
&lt; p &gt; The cost of public assistance to families of workers in the fast-food industry is nearly $ 7 billion per year .
&lt; p &gt; At an average of $ <unk> billion per year , spending on Medicaid and the <unk> Health Insurance Program ( <unk> ) accounts for more than half of these costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in or near <unk> .
One in five families with a member holding a fast-food job has an income below the <unk> line , and 43 percent have an income two times the federal <unk> level or less .
&lt; p &gt; Even full-time hours are not enough to <unk> for low wages .
The families of more than half of the fast-food workers employed 40 or more hours per week are enrolled in public assistance programs .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> &lt; p &gt; After years of losses , job growth has slowly returned to the U.S. economy .
However , <unk> new jobs are often <unk> <unk> for those recently lost .
<unk> occupations <unk> for 60 percent of employment losses between 2007 and 2009 , yet they represent just 20 percent of <unk> job <unk> These numbers indicate that <unk> jobs <unk> at the center , rather than the margins , of the recovery .
A recent analysis by the National <unk> Law Project shows that <unk> positions account for nearly three out of five jobs generated in the first three years of economic <unk> &lt; p &gt; With jobs paying too little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of working families must rely on publicly funded safety net programs to make ends meet .
<unk> with six years of high unemployment rates , the growth in <unk> jobs without benefits has increased demand on the nations vital safety net system , which <unk> the burden when jobs do not pay enough .
&lt; p &gt; Even at full time , the federal minimum wage of $ <unk> per hour fails to provide sufficient income for workers to provide food , housing , health care , transportation and other basic needs for their families .
Low work hours in many of the growing service sector industries reduce earnings even further .
When employers pay <unk> wages , workers must turn to public programs to meet their basic needs .
<unk> income tax credits , publicly <unk> health insurance , income support and food <unk> allow these working families to <unk> the gap between their <unk> and <unk> .
This is the public cost of <unk> jobs in America .
The cost is public because taxpayers bear it .
Yet it remains hidden in national policy <unk> about <unk> , employment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( <unk> percent ) of public benefits spending goes to working <unk>
, families with a working member .
With jobs that put their earnings below <unk> needs , our <unk> indicate these families must rely on Medicaid , food <unk> , the <unk> Income Tax Credit and other support to provide the food , <unk> and health care for which their jobs alone will not pay .
&lt; p &gt; The fast-food industry stands out for both its low wages and its <unk> of full-time work jobs .
The <unk> <unk> wage for core <unk> <unk> fast-food workers , those working at least 27 weeks in a year and 10 hours a week , is $ <unk> an <unk> The <unk> number of hours for these jobs is 30 .
As a result , annual earnings in the fast-food industry are well below the income needed for <unk> .
<unk> industry jobs are also much less likely than other jobs to provide health benefits .
Only 13 percent of core <unk> fast-food workers receive health benefits through their employer , compared to <unk> percent of workers as a <unk> &lt; p &gt; This paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of low wages , <unk> time work hours and low benefits in fast-food and other <unk> industries .
To determine these costs , we draw on publicly available administrative and survey data on Medicaid , food <unk> , the <unk> Income Tax Credit and Temporary <unk> for <unk> <unk> to fast-food workers and their <unk> .
We estimate the cost of these four programs for working families <unk> $ <unk> billion per year from 2007 to 2011 .
The cost for families of <unk> fast-food workers <unk> nearly $ 7 billion a year .
&lt; p &gt; Although extensive , the hidden public cost of <unk> work rarely factors into <unk> about state and national policy .
The public benefits discussed in this report provide a vital support system for millions of the working poor .
The findings of this report suggest those programs could be more effective if <unk> by measures that improve workers wages and benefits , either through public policy measures such as living and minimum wage laws , or through <unk> <unk> .
&lt; h &gt; <unk>
Data <unk> and <unk> &lt; p &gt; This section <unk> our data sources and methods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report .
&lt; p &gt; Public <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; We focus on four vital public benefits programs that account for hundreds of <unk> in assistance to working families : Health insurance ( Medicaid and <unk> Health Insurance Program , or <unk> , coverage ) , 6 the Federal <unk> Income Tax Credit ( <unk> ) , food <unk> ( the <unk> <unk> <unk> Program , or <unk> ) and basic household income assistance ( Temporary <unk> for <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ) .
To arrive at this list , we used the following criteria : &lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
We limit the study to the largest <unk> programs that <unk> benefits to families with low <unk> .
Our analysis covers programs used by families with active <unk> and workers , even when the availability of those benefits does not depend on a <unk> working status .
We analyze only programs that function as income <unk> , <unk> <unk> , educational and other programs that <unk> assist <unk> families .
&lt; p &gt; Data <unk> .
An ideal analysis of the hidden public cost of <unk> work would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , including child care <unk> and <unk> school <unk> .
But our method for <unk> these costs to a workers employment status requires both <unk> program <unk> and administrative data , and <unk> survey data on the benefits consumption of workers .
As a result , our estimates necessarily exclude some federal and many state and local programs for which the required data were <unk> , such as state earned income tax credit programs and local services to the poor .
&lt; p &gt; Data <unk> &lt; p &gt; This report <unk> data from three sources .
First , we <unk> <unk> government administrative data for the four public support programs named above for all 50 states and Washington , <unk>
These data document both the annual enrollment and the annual benefits paid by each program ( please note that we exclude the costs of program administration and <unk> ) .
<unk> A : <unk> provides detailed <unk> program data .
&lt; p &gt; Second , we used the March <unk> of the U.S. <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) to obtain information on employment , worker <unk> and public benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total amount of public benefits paid to different groups of workers .
To correct for the <unk> <unk> of program enrollment in the <unk> , we adjust the <unk> so that estimated program costs match the administrative program data for each <unk> &lt; p &gt; To combine the <unk> and administrative data , we selected a <unk> period ( <unk> ) that <unk> the impact of annual <unk> in program costs and enrollment .
For the <unk> Income Tax Credit and the <unk> <unk> <unk> Program , we were able to pool data for all five years .
Because the release of administrative data for Temporary <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> slightly , our data for that program cover the shorter <unk> period .
The release of Medicaid data <unk> an additional year , <unk> our sample to the <unk> period <unk> .
To link program costs to worker characteristics , we <unk> <unk> data for the same time period to each program .
&lt; p &gt; Using multiple years allows us to smooth the changes in enrollment and cost over the course of the <unk> .
During the past decade , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and <unk> benefits <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> and the subsequent period of slow employment growth increased the working population eligible for public assistance .
In some states <unk> responded to <unk> in state tax revenues by <unk> program eligibility and benefits levels .
Other states <unk> expanded program eligibility , particularly for Medicaid and <unk> , in response to the <unk> loss of jobs and <unk> health <unk> We <unk> these trends in <unk> <unk>
&lt; p &gt; This process <unk> <unk> estimates of the hidden public cost of <unk> work .
To <unk> those numbers into public benefits payments at the state level and to develop estimates for the fast-food industry , we <unk> a model that made it possible to integrate data from a third source , the U.S. <unk> <unk> American Community <unk> ( <unk> ) , which contains a larger sample size than the <unk> .
The use of the <unk> allows us to estimate costs for all U.S. workers , for our <unk> of <unk> fast-food workers and for some states with large populations .
Since the <unk> and <unk> do not separate <unk> and <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> data from the U.S. <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) to identify restaurant occupations that are primarily limited service , and to adjust the total counts for the workforce to correct for limitations in the individual survey data .
In doing so , we use a conservative definition of <unk> fast-food workers , including only workers directly employed in <unk> and <unk> <unk> positions .
&lt; p &gt; From our <unk> sample and our estimate of total <unk> fast-food workers we exclude those with only a <unk> <unk> to the workforce .
To be included in the analysis , a worker had to meet the requirement of working at least 27 weeks and at least 10 hours per week in a given year .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> fast-food workers in the sample met these <unk> &lt; p &gt; Additionally , our analysis can not take into account enrollment in other federal or state programs for which data are not <unk> available .
These programs include Child Care <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Children <unk> Program , Free or <unk> Price <unk> , Section 8 <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> programs .
<unk> <unk> of these programs find that significant shares of their <unk> <unk> support <unk> , working <unk> This report focuses only on the largest federal public assistance programs and covers a limited segment of the fast-food workforce .
Thus , our estimates of both program <unk> and costs are conservative , and by definition <unk> total public costs .
&lt; p &gt; A final <unk> <unk> concerns the family basis of public benefits programs .
While low earnings is the basic <unk> for program eligibility , public benefits do not necessarily go directly to the worker .
For example , some workers have neither public nor private health insurance , but <unk> their children in the <unk> program .
Other benefits , such as <unk> and <unk> , are provided at the family level .
<unk> , our measure of public benefits to employed workers covers benefits provided to the family as a whole , rather than only those provided directly and exclusively to the worker .
For a detailed explanation of this process , see <unk> <unk>
&lt; h &gt; II .
<unk> &lt; p &gt; Public Program enrollment and <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Medicaid and the <unk> Health Insurance Program ( <unk> ) , the <unk> Income Tax Credit , food <unk> and Temporary <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> $ <unk> billion <unk> &lt; p &gt; Medicaid and <unk> account for more than <unk> of total costs ( Table 1 ) .
The next most <unk> programs , the <unk> Income Tax Credit ( $ <unk> billion <unk> ) and food <unk> ( $ <unk> billion <unk> ) , account for just under 30 percent of total benefits costs .
At $ <unk> billion per year , <unk> amounts to less than 3 percent of total benefits costs .
This <unk> variation in program costs reflects differences in the cost of benefits , <unk> restrictions on eligibility for employed individuals and broad <unk> in <unk> <unk> and assistance levels .
&lt; p &gt; Program enrollment by Working <unk> &lt; p &gt; We next estimate the share of people participating in the four programs who are in working families , and the share of the cost of the programs <unk> to these families .
We find that working families account for <unk> percent of all program <unk> and <unk> percent of total program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total cost of assistance to working families from the four programs <unk> $ <unk> billion per year between 2007 and 2011 .
&lt; p &gt; With the exception of <unk> , which <unk> eligibility to extremely <unk> levels , working families account for a majority of the cost of every public benefits program in our sample .
The <unk> Income Tax Credit ( <unk> ) , which is targeted specifically at working families , accounts for the largest share of enrollment .
While fewer working families participate in Medicaid and <unk> than the <unk> , these two programs account for 60 percent of the cost of public assistance to working families for the four programs <unk> ( $ <unk> billion ) .
( <unk> for larger states can be found in <unk> <unk> ) &lt; p &gt; Which <unk> Have the <unk> <unk> of Program enrollment ?
&lt; p &gt; Because public support programs are <unk> to provide needed assistance to <unk> <unk> , it seems likely that <unk> industries will account for a <unk> large share of program costs .
Our estimates indicate this is indeed the case .
Figure 2 ( page 7 ) shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry .
The <unk> and food services sector ( 44 percent ) has the highest public program participation rate of any industry .
As expected , the list of industries with the highest participation rates is <unk> by the service sector .
<unk> of the families with a worker in &quot; other services &quot; <unk> personal services , <unk> services and repair and maintenance <unk> public assistance , as do 30 percent of the families with a worker in the retail industry or in <unk> and <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; We next look at a <unk> of employees in the restaurant <unk> <unk> fast-food workers .
These workers and their families are more than twice as likely as working families in general to be enrolled in public programs .
<unk> , we find that 52 percent of the families of <unk> fast-food workers participate in at least one public benefits program compared to 25 percent of all working families .
In other words , public benefits receipt is the rule , rather than the exception , for this workforce .
&lt; p &gt; We find the total cost of public programs for families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year between 2007 and 2011 ( Table 3 , page 7 ) .
More than <unk> families of <unk> fast-food workers ( 45 percent ) participate in the <unk> Income Tax Credit , nearly double the number that <unk> in any other program .
However , the <unk> Income Tax Credit is less expensive than other programs on a household basis , with average benefits of approximately $ <unk> for the families of <unk> <unk> food workers .
The number of families with adults enrolled in Medicaid , <unk> , is significantly smaller .
But <unk> to significantly higher program costs , Medicaid accounts for more total spending on fast-food workers and their families than any other program .
<unk> on the two health programs combined was $ <unk> billion , followed by <unk> at $ <unk> billion and food <unk> at $ <unk> billion .
&lt; p &gt; The high participation rate of families of core fast-food workers in public programs can be <unk> to three major factors : the <unk> low wages , low work hours and low benefits .
In 2011 , the <unk> <unk> line fast-food worker working at least 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ( Figure 3 ) .
The <unk> <unk> earned $ <unk> an hour , while the <unk> <unk> earned $ <unk> an hour .
The <unk> wage for the United States workforce as a whole in 2011 was $ <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> with low pay , the fast-food industry has low rates of health care coverage .
<unk> , 13 percent of core <unk> fast-food workers receive health benefits through their employer , compared to <unk> percent for the workforce as a whole .
When we <unk> the analysis to workers employed 30 hours or more per week , the share enrolled in <unk> health insurance programs provided by their employer <unk> slightly , to 17 <unk> &lt; p &gt; <unk> jobs are also more likely to be <unk> jobs .
Even <unk> to the core workforce , we find the <unk> fast-food employee works 30 hours per week , compared to 40 for the workforce as a whole .
<unk> half ( 46 percent ) of core <unk> fast-food jobs provide between 20 and 35 hours of employment per week .
This combination of low pay and limited work hours results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low pay may in some cases be offset by earnings from other family members , workers in the fast-food industry are twice as likely to be members of families with earnings below or near <unk> than the workforce as a <unk> ( Table 4 , page 9 ) .
<unk> 20 percent of <unk> fast-food workers live in families with <unk> below the federal <unk> level , compared to just 5 percent of workers as a <unk> An additional 23 percent of fast-food families are near poor with <unk> between 100 percent and <unk> percent of the federal <unk> level , compared to 13 percent in the workforce as whole .
<unk> , these families are made up of <unk> <unk> classes of workers .
More than two out of five <unk> fast-food workers are <unk> American ( 23 percent ) or <unk> ( 20 percent ) , and <unk> percent of workers are women .
&lt; p &gt; To measure whether the high <unk> of public programs in the fast-food industry relative to other industries is mainly caused by low work hours , we calculate program <unk> by hours worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the participation rates in public programs for <unk> food employees by work hours .
<unk> workers are far more likely to work short hours that limit total potential weekly <unk> pay .
Of the total workforce , just 4 percent work between 10 and 20 hours per week , but 12 percent of fast-food workers do , and 43 percent of those workers families participate in public programs .
At the other end of the spectrum , a <unk> <unk> is the exception rather than the rule in fast food .
Just 28 percent of core <unk> fast-food workers regularly work 40 or more hours per week , compared to 75 percent of the workforce as a whole .
Even at 40 hours a week , however , more than half ( 52 percent ) of <unk> fast-food workers families participate in public programs .
These figures <unk> that <unk> level <unk> for <unk> with <unk> fast-food workers do not just result from low wages , but also from a limited number of paid hours .
&lt; h &gt; III .
Policy <unk> &lt; p &gt; The popular <unk> is that fast-food workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> the core workforce , those working at least 27 weeks per year and 10 hours or more per week , provides a very different picture .
The share of these workers who are under the age of 19 and living with a parent ( 18 percent ) is smaller than the share with children of their own ( 26 percent ) .
<unk> , <unk> percent of the core <unk> workers in the fast-food industry are not in school and are single or married adults with or without children .
For more than <unk> of these workers , fast-food wages are an essential component of family income .
&lt; p &gt; Because pay is low and weekly work hours are limited , the families of more than half of the workers in the fast-food industry are unable to make ends meet without <unk> in public programs .
These families are twice as likely as working families in general to require public aid .
Our conservative <unk> indicate this public assistance <unk> a minimum annual price tag of nearly $ 7 billion .
&lt; p &gt; Low wages , benefits and work hours in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> food workers and others whose jobs pay too little to provide for food , <unk> , health care and other basic <unk> , Medicaid , the <unk> Income Tax Credit , the <unk> <unk> <unk> Program and Temporary <unk> for <unk> <unk> are <unk> programs .
These programs provide a last line of <unk> between <unk> growing <unk> workforce and the want of basic <unk> .
The results of this report suggest these programs would be more effective if they were combined with measures to improve wages and health benefits among <unk> workers .
&lt; p &gt; The data we have <unk> indicate working families would directly benefit from improved pay and hours in the fast-food industry .
We show that fast-food workers live in <unk> families compared to other workers , they are primarily adults and they require public assistance at a higher rate than the workforce as a whole .
This is true even among full-time workers , and among <unk> workers whose families require public support at a higher rate than do the families of other <unk> <unk> , these factors indicate that raising fast-food wages would provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
&lt; p &gt; The <unk> of high program participation rates in <unk> <unk> service , <unk> and <unk> , retail , <unk> a second important reason to <unk> efforts to raise wages for <unk> workers .
Unlike manufacturers , who are not a major employer of <unk> workers and who must compete with <unk> <unk> with lower labor and production costs , the service industries <unk> <unk> Americans compete on a domestic and level playing field .
Rather than <unk> the competitive <unk> of global product markets , the <unk> structure of fast-food and other domestic service industries reflects a <unk> of market conditions and policy choices about minimum standards for work .
&lt; p &gt; Pay in the fast-food industry could be increased through a variety of means .
Many fast-food workers earn close to the minimum wage and would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage or through targeted local laws to raise labor standards .
<unk> <unk> in the fast-food industry would increase wage and benefits standards in <unk> to the markets in specific <unk> areas and the economics of particular market <unk> .
Very few fast-food <unk> currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , improving wages and health benefits in the industry would improve the living standards of <unk> families while reducing the public cost of <unk> work .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> A : <unk> &lt; p &gt; We build our estimates of the public cost of <unk> work by <unk> publicly available data on costs and participation levels for public benefits programs with <unk> providing information on the <unk> , employment and public program participation of U.S. workers .
While costs and participation levels on public programs are available from administrative <unk> , those data only provide information on <unk> program participation .
Our <unk> makes it possible to determine the cost of public benefits payments to individual <unk> of the population , specifically working families and families with fast-food workers .
In this report , we extend our previous work on the participation levels and <unk> costs of <unk> work in California , <unk> , <unk> and New <unk> to answer questions not just about particular states , but about the country as a whole .
After <unk> administrative data for basic public benefits programs , we followed a <unk> approach : Step 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Step 2 : <unk> program participation and costs , applying model to the American Community <unk> .
Step 3 : <unk> American Community <unk> data to match <unk> administrative data .
&lt; p &gt; Following the approach first established by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in the 2004 report &quot; The <unk> Public Cost of <unk> <unk> in California , &quot; we adjust the <unk> of data from the March <unk> to the <unk> so that costs for each of the public programs match <unk> administrative data .
For a detailed account of this process , consult the technical <unk> from our previous report , &quot; The <unk> Public Cost of <unk> <unk> Work in <unk> . &quot;
&lt; p &gt; With a few exceptions , our adjustments to program participation information in the <unk> increase enrollment estimates , due to <unk> in the <unk> In general , our <unk> procedure led to relatively small adjustments to <unk> for Medicaid and food <unk> ( 20 to 25 percent ) , larger adjustments for the <unk> Income Tax Credit ( more than 100 percent , on average ) and a wide range for <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for total program costs were much smaller overall : Medicaid ( <unk> percent ) , food <unk> ( 17 percent ) , the <unk> Income Tax Credit ( <unk> to <unk> percent on average ) and <unk> ( between 5 percent and 27 percent , depending on the state ) .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> annual enrollment and costs for each program , by state , are shown in <unk> <unk> and <unk> ( pages 13 through 15 ) .
&lt; p &gt; Step 2 : Modeling Program <unk> and Cost Information from the <unk> and <unk> to the American Community survey ( <unk> ) &lt; p &gt; While the <unk> contains both enrollment and cost estimates of public programs , the sample sizes available are too small to provide estimates of <unk> , such as workers in fast-food <unk> .
In response , we <unk> data from the American Community <unk> ( <unk> ) , 19 which has a much larger sample but less information on participation in public programs .
The <unk> <unk> asks about Medicaid and food <unk> , but <unk> the <unk> and does not <unk> between <unk> and other welfare assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> by modeling program enrollment for the working population in the <unk> and applying this model to the working population in the <unk> .
More <unk> , for each worker , we model the <unk> of anyone in the workers family participating in the program and the cost of the program for all enrolled members of the workers family .
We model participation with a <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> participation in the program as a result of basic <unk> relevant <unk> variables .
For families that are enrolled , program costs are <unk> using <unk> <unk> and result in an expected program cost <unk> on enrollment .
Modeling for <unk> , food <unk> and <unk> is done with the national sample .
Modeling for Medicaid is done on a <unk> basis to account for the different eligibility requirements in adult and <unk> Medicaid and <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; We use the following <unk> variables in the <unk> models when <unk> were <unk> significant at the 5 percent level : &lt; p &gt; <unk> wage over previous year &lt; p &gt; Family income of previous year &lt; p &gt; Age &lt; p &gt; Federal <unk> Level ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to <unk> percent , 150 to <unk> percent , 200 to <unk> percent , 250 to <unk> percent , 300 percent and more ) Number of adults older than 18 in family ( <unk> or more ) Number of children 18 and younger in family ( <unk> or more ) &lt; p &gt; <unk> degree <unk> ( no high school <unk> , high school <unk> , some college , <unk> degree or higher ) &lt; p &gt; After applying the <unk> models , for each public program the <unk> worker will have an associated p , the <unk> family participation and a <unk> , the expected family program costs <unk> on a member of the family being enrolled .
If the <unk> sample weight is <unk> <unk> then for any <unk> S the total number of workers enrolled in the program <unk> : &lt; p &gt; + <unk> * <unk> &lt; p &gt; And the total program costs <unk> to workers <unk> &lt; p &gt; + <unk> * <unk> * <unk> &lt; p &gt; Step 3 : <unk> the <unk> to <unk> enrollment Information of <unk> in the <unk> &lt; p &gt; To ensure the working population in the <unk> <unk> the enrollment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> .
First , for each program and for each state , the program participation rates of workers in the <unk> are <unk> adjusted to equal the participation rates of workers in the <unk> .
Next , for each program and for each state , the expected family program costs , <unk> on enrollment in the <unk> , are <unk> adjusted to equal the average family program costs of working individuals in the <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; A review of the <unk> adjustments for participation show : Medicaid adult participation is over <unk> by the model , leading to <unk> adjustments ( <unk> to 0 percent ) ; Medicaid child participation adjustments are small and <unk> around zero ( <unk> to 10 percent ) ; and , with a few exceptions ( e.g.
, <unk> , <unk> and Washington , <unk> ) , <unk> , food <unk> and <unk> participation adjustments vary widely as they were <unk> on a <unk> basis .
<unk> , an adjustment is done for a <unk> variable indicating participation in any of the four programs which leads to small changes ( <unk> percent to 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were smaller : Medicaid adult cost adjustments were <unk> at zero ( <unk> to 10 percent ) ; Medicaid child adjustments <unk> negative ( <unk> to 8 percent ) ; food <unk> adjustments were more moderate than those for participation ( <unk> to 22 percent ) as were <unk> adjustments ( <unk> to 24 percent ) ; and <unk> adjustments <unk> widely .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> the total Number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> . &lt; p &gt; The identification of all <unk> fast-food workers is not directly possible for any available large scale <unk> with information on the worker characteristics required for this study , including the <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> , which we use for <unk> , does have a specific + <unk> <unk> code but it does not <unk> between <unk> or <unk> <unk> latter representing fast food .
To address this issue , we combine occupation codes within the broad restaurant industry from the <unk> with data from a firm survey , the U.S. <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , that <unk> between <unk> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it possible to identify <unk> fast-food workers in our <unk> sample and to further provide an estimate of the population of <unk> <unk> food workers in the United States .
&lt; p &gt; The <unk> is a survey of <unk> <unk> per panel ( every six months ) , which takes three years to fully collect the sample of <unk> million <unk> .
The <unk> reports annual employment and wage estimates for more than 800 occupations within individual industries , including separate measures for <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
We use the occupations within <unk> <unk> from the <unk> to determine what occupations to analyze in the <unk> that will best identify <unk> fast-food workers .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> the distribution of occupations in the <unk> across <unk> and <unk> <unk> allows us to determine which occupations within the broader <unk> <unk> <unk> have a high share of workers in the <unk> sector .
We further determine which occupations within <unk> represent <unk> fast-food workers .
For example , we <unk> &quot; Public <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; Executive <unk> &quot; and other occupations clearly not involved in preparing and selling fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> fast-food occupations are also identified in the <unk> .
It is important to note that <unk> <unk> across the two <unk> is only the same for select occupations .
The occupations with the highest share of workers in <unk> <unk> that also represented <unk> workers are : &quot; <unk> Food <unk> and Service <unk> &quot; ( 95 percent are employed in limited service ) , &quot; Counter <unk> , etc . &quot;
( <unk> percent ) and &quot; <unk> &quot; ( 75 percent ) .
Because the <unk> uses the same <unk> <unk> for these occupations , we restricted our <unk> sample to <unk> <unk> workers employed in these three occupations .
This definition <unk> some workers <unk> to <unk> fast-food work , such as <unk> .
But , as noted above , the <unk> does not <unk> between <unk> in <unk> or <unk> service <unk> and we know from the <unk> that only 31 percent of restaurant industry <unk> work in fast food .
&lt; p &gt; To estimate the total count of U.S. fast-food workers , we use a separate , narrow definition of core <unk> line fast-food workers based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the <unk> for &quot; <unk> Food <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> Food &quot; and &quot; <unk> , <unk> Food &quot; in the <unk> .
We <unk> &quot; Counter <unk> and <unk> &quot; from this estimate .
While those occupations <unk> ideal modeling <unk> for fast-food work in the <unk> , many workers in them work in jobs commonly not identified as fast food .
As a result , their <unk> may <unk> the total estimated count of fast-food workers .
Our <unk> definition of core , <unk> fast-food workers accounts for <unk> million of the <unk> million in the <unk> workforce as <unk> in the <unk> .
It <unk> managers , <unk> and employees such as <unk> drivers not working directly in <unk> .
It also <unk> coffee shop , <unk> and food <unk> workers , who could be considered fast-food workers .
<unk> those occupations would add an additional <unk> workers to the total , and would increase the cost estimates by 16 percent , to $ 8 billion .
&lt; p &gt; To <unk> that the occupations used to model <unk> fast-food workers in the <unk> provide a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these occupations to the &quot; <unk> , <unk> Food &quot; occupation , which by definition consists of only fast-food workers in the <unk> sector .
The <unk> wage for &quot; <unk> , <unk> Food &quot; in the <unk> is $ <unk> , compared to $ <unk> for the three occupations used in the <unk> modeling .
The <unk> in wages between occupations we <unk> as containing large numbers of <unk> food workers , and an <unk> group limited solely to fast-food workers , provides confidence that our <unk> sample serves as a good <unk> for the larger group .
&lt; p &gt; The two <unk> <unk> categories that we use as an estimate of the universe of <unk> fast-food workers account for <unk> percent of all workers in the <unk> restaurant industry .
Further <unk> on weeks and hours brings our total universe of core <unk> fast-food workers to <unk> we lose <unk> percent of the total sample employed less than 10 hours per week and / or less than 26 weeks per year .
As a result , this report provides a conservative estimate of the total cost of public assistance programs associated with <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Public <unk> <unk> &lt; h &gt; <unk> C : <unk> <unk> for <unk> of <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; <unk> for <unk> participation rates in each of the public programs , and the associated costs , for the families of fast-food workers are included in the two <unk> below .
Due to sample size limitations , we <unk> estimates for those states where the number of <unk> fast-food workers in the <unk> sample fell below 500 individuals .
Additionally , <unk> enrollment and costs are not shown due to the low enrollment in the program but are included in the total .

Your application must be complete in order to be reviewed for admission .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> : We can not recommend students for <unk> until their applications are complete ( including receipt of test scores ) .

&lt; h &gt; <unk> for Graduate Student <unk> &lt; p &gt; Due to the limited number of students we are allowed to recommend for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the applicants who meet all of our qualifications .
These guidelines are designed to help potential students <unk> their applications .
For example , students who lack strong training in economics or <unk> may want to take additional courses before applying .
&lt; p &gt; Every year , a committee of faculty members <unk> potential applicants for admission to the graduate program in <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Since the composition of this committee changes frequently and the pool of applicants changes each year , we do not use <unk> rules in determining admissions .
<unk> , the following guidelines are used as a starting point in our <unk> .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; <unk> records are <unk> upon heavily .
We will not consider a student with a grade point average ( <unk> ) below <unk> , which is the University &apos; s minimum standard for graduate admission .
<unk> , we consider the overall <unk> , the economics <unk> , and the <unk> in <unk> , statistics , and other <unk> methods , with particularly heavy weight on the economics and <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; Many of our applicants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other institutions .
When <unk> in graduate courses are available , we put greater weight on those than on undergraduate <unk> .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; When students have <unk> <unk> and <unk> with which we are not familiar , greater weight is placed on the <unk> examinations .
<unk> weight is placed on the <unk> , but the <unk> and <unk> are also considered .
&lt; h &gt; Personal Statement &lt; p &gt; The essay by the applicant is also given substantial weight .
We are looking for students who have clear and reasonable objectives .
We want to know why the applicant wants to study <unk> and resource economics at Berkeley and how this training will be used .
&lt; h &gt; Letters of <unk> &lt; p &gt; Letters of recommendation are given <unk> attention .
We put particular weight on letters from people who have previously recommended students who have done well in our program .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> &lt; p &gt; In some cases , an applicant may already have a paper accepted for publication in an economics <unk> .
If so , this information may <unk> heavily in the applicant &apos; s favor , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; We only admit students who have prior training in economics and <unk> methods .
At the very minimum , a student should have taken <unk> level <unk> and <unk> courses and a year of <unk> .
<unk> applicants have usually taken courses in <unk> <unk> , statistics , <unk> and a significant number of undergraduate economics courses at the <unk> and upper level .
Students need to have completed a course in real and functional analysis equivalent to Berkeley &apos; s <unk> <unk> before being allowed to take the graduate <unk> <unk> <unk> at Berkeley .
We highly recommend taking such a course before <unk> at Berkeley .
If you have taken a real analysis course in another university , please upload the <unk> with your application .
&lt; p &gt; We may make exceptions for students who do not meet these guidelines if they have other characteristics or experiences that we believe are important , such as professional experience or graduate training in fields relevant to the core research interests of the department , yet academic preparation is an excellent <unk> of success in our graduate program .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
In previous years , international students have <unk> at least one quarter of the entering class each fall .
&lt; p &gt; International students are required to show <unk> in English , with a minimum <unk> score of <unk> for the <unk> test , <unk> in the <unk> test , or <unk> for the paper test .
&lt; p &gt; In <unk> an international student &apos; s background , we are sometimes <unk> with the <unk> system used , the content of courses , etc .
We recommend that foreign students provide an official explanation of the <unk> system and explain in some detail the content of the courses they have taken .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> for Graduate <unk> &lt; p &gt; An applicant should hold a degree comparable to a <unk> &apos; s degree at the University of California and must have <unk> strong <unk> potential .
The degree need not be in <unk> or resource economics .

@ @ <unk> @ <unk> / &lt; p &gt; What is the universe made of ?
This is one of the most basic questions <unk> has had about the world surrounding us , but has proven one of the most difficult to answer .
Our knowledge of matter and energy has <unk> rapidly over the last few <unk> , leading to a detailed understanding of nearly all of the materials and <unk> around us .
<unk> have even <unk> to understand the principles that have <unk> the evolution of our universe itself over the past few billion years .
&lt; p &gt; One of the most <unk> <unk> of recent science , however , is that we have much yet to learn .
Only a tiny fraction of the universe seems to be <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> we have <unk> so long to understand .
The identity of the vast majority of the <unk> remains a <unk> !
&lt; p &gt; Our present understanding of the universe &apos; s composition is roughly as follows : &lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> : 5 % of the mass in the universe This is ordinary matter <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets , people , etc .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> <unk> : 25 % This is the so-called &quot; missing mass &quot; of the universe .
It <unk> the dark matter <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of structure in the universe .
The dark matter is said to be &quot; cold &quot; because it is <unk> ( <unk> ) during the era of structure <unk> .
<unk> matter is currently <unk> to be <unk> of some kind of new <unk> <unk> , usually referred to as a <unk> <unk> massive <unk> ( <unk> ) .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> Energy : 70 % Through <unk> of distant <unk> , two research groups have independently discovered that the expansion of the universe appears to be getting faster with time .
This seems to require some kind of &quot; <unk> &quot; effect which we do not understand .
<unk> believe that the <unk> may be caused by some kind of new energy field that <unk> the universe , perhaps even the <unk> constant that <unk> <unk> almost a century ago .
Whatever the source of this <unk> turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy .

Any other unique identifying number , <unk> , or code ( note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the <unk> to code the data ) &lt; p &gt; There are also additional standards and criteria to protect individual &apos; s privacy from <unk> .
Any code used to replace the <unk> in <unk> can not be <unk> from any information related to the individual and the master codes , nor can the method to <unk> the codes be <unk> .
For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code their data because the <unk> are <unk> from their name .
Additionally , the <unk> must not have actual knowledge that the research subject could be <unk> from the remaining <unk> in the <unk> used in the research study .
In other words , the information would still be considered <unk> is there was a way to identify the individual even though all of the 18 <unk> were removed .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> &lt; h &gt; What is <unk> ?
&lt; p &gt; <unk> health information ( <unk> ) is any information in the medical record or designated record set that can be used to identify an individual and that was created , used , or <unk> in the course of providing a health care service such as <unk> or treatment .
<unk> regulations allow researchers to access and use <unk> when necessary to conduct research .
However , <unk> only affects research that uses , creates , or <unk> <unk> that will be entered in to the medical record or will be used for healthcare services , such as treatment , payment or operations .
&lt; p &gt; For example , <unk> is used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , such as <unk> chart review .
Also , studies that create new medical information because a health care service is being performed as part of research , such as <unk> a health condition or a new drug or device for <unk> a health condition , create <unk> that will be entered into the medical record .
For example , sponsored clinical <unk> that submit data to the U.S. Food and <unk> Administration involve <unk> and are therefore subject to <unk> regulations .
&lt; h &gt; What is not <unk> ?
&lt; p &gt; In contrast , some research studies use data that is <unk> because it includes personal <unk> such as name , address , but it is not considered to be <unk> because the data are not associated with or <unk> from a healthcare service event ( treatment , payment , operations , medical records ) not entered into the medical records , nor will the subject / patient be informed of the results .
Research health information that is kept only in the researchers records is not subject to <unk> but is <unk> by other human subjects protection regulations .
&lt; p &gt; Examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies as the use of <unk> data , <unk> tests that do not go into the medical record because they are part of a basic research study and the results will not be <unk> to the subject , and testing done without the <unk> <unk> .
Some <unk> basic research can fall into this category such as the search for potential <unk> <unk> , <unk> control elements , and other <unk> <unk> research .
In contrast , <unk> testing for a known disease that is considered to be part of <unk> , treatment and health care would be considered to use <unk> and therefore subject to <unk> regulations .
&lt; p &gt; Also note , health information by itself without the 18 <unk> is not considered to be <unk> .
For example , a <unk> of vital signs by themselves do not <unk> protected health information .
However , if the vital signs <unk> includes medical record numbers , then the entire <unk> must be protected since it contains an <unk> .
<unk> is anything that can be used to identify an individual such as private information , <unk> images , <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , data sets , as well as direct <unk> of the research subjects in clinical <unk> .

@ @ <unk> @ <unk> / &lt; p &gt; <unk> to the website of the Department of French at UC Berkeley .
In our department you can study French and <unk> literature , culture , and film , along with the French language and French <unk> .
The dedicated and creative teachers and <unk> in our department share a commitment to <unk> in teaching , whether it is in an <unk> French class , a <unk> course for majors ( all of which are taught in French ) , a course on French literature in <unk> , or an advanced graduate <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; For its undergraduate majors and <unk> and its graduate students the Berkeley French Department provides <unk> coverage in the traditional , <unk> based <unk> of French literature and culture , as well as in <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> this coverage with the study of a wide array of related fields and topics &quot; from <unk> history and theory to <unk> , to social and cultural theory , to historical and <unk> <unk> , to the study of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , visual arts and film , music , popular culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and research at both undergraduate and graduate levels .
@ @ <unk> @ <unk> / &lt; h &gt; <unk> <unk> Program &lt; p &gt; The Department of <unk> grants a <unk>
degree in music and also a minor in music .
We are dedicated to a <unk> education in the arts and <unk> , and thus involve students in all aspects of the study of <unk> and creative studies , historical and cultural studies , music and technology , and performance .
Our <unk> is responsive to the interests of a diverse student body , and we <unk> ourselves on offering a broad and flexible program .
&lt; p &gt; The major may serve as <unk> training for the student seeking a career in music or provide a <unk> source of <unk> for the student with other career goals .
<unk> majors are asked to demonstrate a minimum standard of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> test .
Since we are a Department of <unk> rather than a School of <unk> , a performance <unk> is not required to declare the major .
<unk> studies are intended to provide <unk> in the skills of <unk> and <unk> and a broad background in the literature and practices of European and a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extensive selection of <unk> courses to create an individual course of study according to their own interests .
The department offers an honors program in which a major in the senior year may develop a special honors project working with a faculty adviser in any area of music studies .
&lt; p &gt; There are a large number of double majors in the department representing fields such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Studies , <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , English , and Business Administration , to just name a few .
@ @ <unk> @ <unk> / &lt; h &gt; Search form &lt; h &gt; <unk> Research <unk> &lt; p &gt; I do research in <unk> <unk> .
A central theme is the study of large <unk> random structures , obtaining <unk> behavior as the size tends to <unk> via consideration of some suitable <unk> random structure .
Much current work involves random network models .
For more detailed <unk> see my research page .
You will find a recent talk on this style of research here .
&lt; p &gt; My research interests are in the areas of machine learning , <unk> learning theory , and <unk> learning .
I work on the <unk> of <unk> efficient methods for large or otherwise complex <unk> problems .
One example is <unk> <unk> problems , where there is <unk> complexity to the space of possible <unk> .
Such methods are important in a variety of application areas , including natural language processing , computer vision , and <unk> .
A second area of interest is the analysis of <unk> methods in a <unk> , <unk> setting .
As well as being of interest in areas such as computer security , where an <unk> environment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design and understanding of <unk> methods in a <unk> setting .
A third area of interest is the design of methods for large scale <unk> decision problems , such as control of <unk> decision processes .
Again , <unk> efficiency is a crucial requirement .
This is a common feature in all of these areas : the <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> efficiency and the <unk> <unk> of a method .
&lt; p &gt; My main <unk> interest is in understanding why we are able to do statistics as well as we do on very high <unk> <unk> without knowing much , even though least <unk> ( <unk> God ) <unk> suggest we should not be able to do anything .
Currently this has led me to focus on <unk> of <unk> <unk> and their <unk> in high <unk> .
<unk> applied interests are in : &lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> , specifically at the moment regulatory networks in the cell .
To my surprise some of the methods <unk> out of my primary interest are relevant to this one .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> ... in part as a ready source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent research focuses on <unk> methods for random processes , random process data analysis and applications in engineering and science generally .
<unk> topics include : modelling the motion of animals and other <unk> and risk analysis for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and similar <unk> .
I also work some on sports statistics , am President of The International <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) and am <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> design of <unk> , <unk> from <unk> applications , is used <unk> in a wide range of scientific and industrial <unk> .
<unk> need to be properly designed so that valid information can be <unk> at a lower cost .
I am interested in efficient <unk> designs and the related construction and <unk> problems .
Currently , I work mostly on design of <unk> in the situation where the response depends on a large number of factors ( variables ) , the so called <unk> design .
When a large number of factors have to be <unk> , but the <unk> runs are expensive , it is not <unk> to <unk> all possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two settings for each factor , an experiment with 10 factors requires <unk> runs to <unk> all the <unk> .
One aspect of my research deals with how to choose a &quot; good &quot; small <unk> of the factor <unk> .
There are interesting connections with <unk> , <unk> theory and <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; My research and teaching activities concern the development and application of <unk> and <unk> methods to address problems in <unk> and <unk> research .
The <unk> <unk> questions are truly <unk> and involve the joint analysis of multiple , diverse , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> allow <unk> to monitor <unk> levels for entire <unk> .
A challenging task is to relate these <unk> <unk> to <unk> and clinical <unk> ( e.g.
, age , sex , environmental exposure ) and outcomes ( e.g.
, cell type / state , * * 27 ; <unk> ; TOOLONG , <unk> time , response to treatment ) as well as to the wealth of <unk> <unk> <unk> available on the web ( e.g.
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> literature ) .
<unk> by these <unk> challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas : <unk> <unk> with <unk> ( <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , variable selection ) and <unk> multiple <unk> testing .
I am also interested in <unk> <unk> and I am a core developer of the <unk> Project , an <unk> and <unk> software project for the analysis of <unk> and <unk> data .
&lt; p &gt; I &apos; m mostly interested in <unk> problems for <unk> data .
More specifically , I have been working on <unk> <unk> for large <unk> data .
It &apos; s an important practical topic because a lot of data analysis <unk> on having good estimates of <unk> .
It &apos; s also very interesting because a lot of <unk> results break down ( rather <unk> ) in <unk> .
So on the theory side , I study questions motivated by applications and ask myself how <unk> standard things break down and how I can describe what sort of &quot; strange &quot; <unk> happen .
More <unk> , I try to use this understanding to come up with new methods that are <unk> <unk> and fix the problems I &apos; ve identified .
At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from data analysis , to <unk> to questions that <unk> <unk> statistics and modern <unk> theory .
Right now , I &apos; m starting to use these insights in some problems <unk> in Finance , having mostly to do with portfolio <unk> .
We have a good group of people in the department working on different aspects of these questions of <unk> data analysis , and it &apos; s really exciting to be doing this at Berkeley right now !
&lt; p &gt; I am a <unk> and <unk> working in the general area of <unk> processes and their applications .
In the past , I have <unk> with <unk> <unk> and others on random <unk> and various other aspects of <unk> on <unk> structures .
I have numerous publications with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Tom <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> and other <unk> processes that <unk> in population <unk> , as well as with <unk> <unk> on various <unk> models that appear in <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
In the past , I have worked with <unk> <unk> , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> and <unk> regarding <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I share an ongoing interest in <unk> with David <unk> and <unk> <unk> that has <unk> in papers on <unk> landscapes , <unk> balance , <unk> <unk> models of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and applications of <unk> to <unk> modeling .
&lt; p &gt; I continue research on <unk> and real trees , particularly applications of ideas from <unk> <unk> such as the <unk> <unk> , some of it in collaboration with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
I am <unk> tree statistics and most recent common <unk> in <unk> populations with <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and I are <unk> <unk> frequency <unk> for <unk> population sizes .
&lt; p &gt; I am in the middle of an extensive project involving <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> on several aspects of <unk> <unk> - particularly applications of <unk> <unk> methods in historical <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I currently have students working on <unk> <unk> models and <unk> <unk> <unk> , the population <unk> of hybrid <unk> , random <unk> associated with <unk> groups , random <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems applied to <unk> balance , and connections between <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> theory .
&lt; h &gt; <unk> <unk> &lt; p &gt; My primary interest is the development of a broad , widely applicable , <unk> sound , <unk> framework for <unk> and managing financial risk .
This is very <unk> and important , given the <unk> that has <unk> financial markets during the last <unk> months .
With colleagues at <unk> <unk> , I am working on extreme risk <unk> , <unk> portfolio <unk> , and the development of <unk> safe financial <unk> .
Many of my research articles can be found in the <unk> <unk> Research <unk> , and some are posted on the Social Sciences Research Network .
&lt; h &gt; Leo <unk> &lt; p &gt; My research interests include the development of <unk> methods for the analysis of data that are <unk> or <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the social <unk> .
I have <unk> to the theory and development of <unk> models , <unk> models , <unk> models , and <unk> analysis models .
<unk> that I have published recently include &quot; On the assignment of individuals to <unk> classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of progress in the analysis of <unk> data &quot; , &quot; <unk> to the <unk> analysis of <unk> <unk> : ... &quot; , &quot; <unk> class analysis : The <unk> study of <unk> types , <unk> variables , and <unk> structures . &quot;
&lt; p &gt; My research areas are in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , I am interested in <unk> practical problems in <unk> <unk> <unk> systems , and in understanding and developing <unk> principles of the practical methods .
My current focuses are : 1 ) develop <unk> methods that provide a consistent <unk> between the <unk> modeling and the <unk> nature of data , 2 ) understand and solve the problem of <unk> estimates in <unk> high <unk> <unk> data , and 3 ) tackle the challenges <unk> by the high level of noise and the lack of <unk> in the <unk> from different resources .
&lt; p &gt; As a <unk> , my research focuses on the application of novel <unk> techniques to the design , analysis and <unk> of data <unk> from public health and human disease studies .
From a <unk> point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <unk> methods for * * 26 ; <unk> ; TOOLONG for ( i ) <unk> diseases and ( <unk> ) environmental exposures , <unk> <unk> in <unk> studies , survey methods and <unk> data analysis , and applications of statistics to <unk> and cell <unk> .
My work is motivated by application of such <unk> techniques most recently to studies of <unk> disease and <unk> including <unk> <unk> to reduce <unk> <unk> in Africa , the impact of <unk> exposure to <unk> outcomes and <unk> <unk> , <unk> key factors in <unk> growth in situations such as <unk> , assessing drug safety with particular interest in the <unk> <unk> side effects of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in California , and the assessment of <unk> <unk> in times of conflict .
&lt; p &gt; I have interests that <unk> the spectrum from theory to <unk> to applications .
I &apos; m most interested in problems that <unk> when working with <unk> data types ; examples I &apos; ve worked with include document <unk> , <unk> , <unk> structures , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Working with these kinds of data types often leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where <unk> methods can be <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
I &apos; ve thus been interested in new <unk> methods for <unk> problems ; specifically I &apos; ve worked on the development of novel <unk> using tools from <unk> <unk> theory and <unk> analysis .
I &apos; m also interested in the interface between <unk> theory and <unk> statistics , particularly in the setting known as &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , where the prior distribution is a general <unk> process .
Here ideas familiar in modern <unk> theory , such as the Chinese restaurant process and <unk> distributions , yield novel <unk> models and novel <unk> procedures .
These methods have numerous applications in areas such as <unk> <unk> , image processing and natural language processing .
I &apos; m quite interested in <unk> these applications , particularly in collaboration with <unk> and computer <unk> .
&lt; h &gt; Michael <unk> &lt; p &gt; My research interests are in <unk> theory .
I have done research on <unk> of independent random variables , laws of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> limit <unk> for <unk> of independent random <unk> , expectations of functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; My work focuses on the development and application of <unk> methods in <unk> .
Most of it <unk> on making <unk> regarding function and evolution from <unk> and <unk> data .
Some of the projects that I am currently involved in are in the areas of human population <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> theory , and <unk> methods in <unk> <unk> .
Examples include <unk> <unk> of whole <unk> data from a diverse set of <unk> including <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , humans , and <unk> , development of methods for <unk> <unk> which can <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the development of <unk> methods for <unk> <unk> parameters in population <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; One of my current interests is in the area of <unk> for education .
I am <unk> problems surrounding the design of electronic documents which provide ways for authors and readers to interact with and <unk> view a data analysis process / statistics research activity .
I am also interested in problems in more traditional areas of statistics that are related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been interested in <unk> between the traditional theory of <unk> processes and other areas of <unk> , especially <unk> .
I have <unk> various random <unk> objects , such as <unk> , <unk> , and trees , and how the <unk> <unk> of such structures over a large number of elements can be described in <unk> terms , most often involving <unk> motion and related processes .
This has led to the study of various <unk> and <unk> <unk> processes whose <unk> may be understood in terms of <unk> <unk> involving random trees .
I am at present engaged in developing various ideas related to random <unk> , random trees , <unk> processes of <unk> , and their time <unk> which provide models for random <unk> or <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I view this line of research largely as pure <unk> , but <unk> of a <unk> kind which is often motivated and <unk> by applications .
<unk> models with a natural <unk> structure typically turn up in different <unk> in diverse fields .
The study of their <unk> structure allows ideas and results developed in one context to be transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> in the field of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and in particular <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I am currently working on <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> and alternative <unk> using <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , I am interested in <unk> and <unk> techniques that are relevant in this context .
&lt; p &gt; I was drawn to the <unk> of statistics by a <unk> with <unk> , and by the way it <unk> <unk> and scientific content .
I have enjoyed <unk> with researchers in many areas , especially the natural <unk> , which have given me opportunities to learn about these fields and to make contributions to them .
<unk> these separate <unk> are <unk> of <unk> <unk> that have been developed over the last 100 years .
This evolution <unk> as <unk> <unk> new challenges in the information age .
&lt; p &gt; I am especially interested in developing methods for <unk> data that <unk> in the form of random functions , such as time series , and which involve large <unk> of data and <unk> <unk> analysis .
Much of my recent work has <unk> around two projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar system ( the <unk> <unk> ) and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; My research centers around <unk> <unk> and <unk> population <unk> .
I am generally interested in developing methods , using techniques from statistics and computer science , to address problems that <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I am also interested in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> methods .
&lt; p &gt; My research concerns the application of statistics to problems in <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
These have provided many novel challenges of both an applied and a <unk> nature .
My major interests within this area are in the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> and humans , including disease <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the variation of <unk> <unk> .
The Human <unk> Project was a <unk> for a number of the problems I have <unk> with my students .
Other areas of interest include the analysis of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , for example , finding <unk> or <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and the analysis of <unk> data .
&lt; p &gt; My research centers on <unk> ( <unk> ) problems , primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures <unk> for specific goals and in <unk> the <unk> in <unk> that rely on <unk> of complex physical systems .
I &apos; ve done research on the internal structure of Sun and Earth , climate modeling , <unk> <unk> , the Big <unk> , the <unk> field , election <unk> , <unk> hearing loss , the U.S. <unk> , the effectiveness of Internet content filters , <unk> <unk> , spectrum <unk> , urban <unk> , and information <unk> .
I am interested in <unk> <unk> , and have published some software .
&lt; p &gt; I am <unk> with a wide range of interests <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I have always been <unk> with <unk> <unk> and data analysis , and this led me quite naturally into the <unk> field of <unk> statistics .
Here I have worked on <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> models for <unk> and <unk> random variables .
&lt; p &gt; The goal of my research group is to develop <unk> methods to estimate / learn <unk> and <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> data from <unk> clinical <unk> or <unk> <unk> studies , or from <unk> ( e.g.
, <unk> <unk> ) studies .
The model <unk> under which these methods are valid should be clearly <unk> , so that they can be subject to <unk> .
The estimates should be <unk> by confidence regions for the true <unk> values or other types of confidence measures ( e.g.
, * * 27 ; <unk> ; TOOLONG of <unk> as measured by the <unk> ) .
The <unk> data structures may involve high <unk> <unk> such as whole <unk> <unk> at various points in time ; <unk> and <unk> of data due to a subject not <unk> well to treatment ( or not feeling well ) ; and changes of treatment at various points in time , based on variables related to the outcome of interest .
Our methods are designed to rely on as few <unk> as possible on <unk> parameters so that they provide <unk> objective <unk> <unk> and testing procedures .
To develop and <unk> these methods , we work with <unk> and real data in collaboration with <unk> , medical researchers , <unk> , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I study <unk> <unk> and random <unk> that shape the structure of human populations .
I helped develop methods of computer <unk> to understand the <unk> of <unk> family members in <unk> English <unk> .
With these methods , I am now <unk> the <unk> and family support available to new <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> century .
Working in &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , I have identified mechanisms that give rise to specific kinds of <unk> in <unk> and population growth .
I am currently interested in patterns of <unk> at extreme <unk> shared between humans and other <unk> , trying to <unk> them with <unk> models for long-term processes of <unk> change .
&lt; p &gt; In broad terms , I am interested in problems at the interface between <unk> and statistics .
Part of my research focuses on <unk> and <unk> random fields , a class of <unk> model based on <unk> used to capture <unk> in <unk> data ( e.g.
, image models , data compression , <unk> <unk> ) .
In general , exact solutions to <unk> problems in such models are <unk> <unk> , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods for <unk> <unk> .
I am also interested in <unk> the effect of <unk> and communication <unk> in <unk> <unk> problems .
A final area of interest is <unk> and theory for <unk> <unk> problems , in which the model <unk> is of the same order ( or larger than ) the sample size .
&lt; p &gt; I am currently working on <unk> <unk> and models involving large data sets from remote <unk> , data networks ( internet and sensor networks ) , <unk> , finance , and <unk> .
<unk> with my students and <unk> , I have been working on different areas of <unk> machine learning , <unk> and <unk> .
These areas include <unk> , <unk> , support <unk> machines ( <unk> ) , and <unk> learning .
On the <unk> side , we have developed <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> for <unk> modeling .
My past research areas have also included <unk> processes , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , signal processing , the minimum description length principle ( <unk> ) , and information theory .

&lt; p &gt; <unk> is the process in which plants turn light energy and <unk> <unk> into food and fuel .
In full sun , plants receive more energy than they can use .
The extra energy could generate <unk> <unk> , but instead , plants <unk> this energy off as heat to protect themselves .
When a cloud <unk> <unk> , plants are slow to recover from this protective process , which is called <unk> <unk> , or <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; In a recent study , researchers used a rapid <unk> technique that <unk> engineers <unk> real <unk> investigate how to help plants realize their full potential during this process .
&lt; p &gt; &quot; It can take minutes to hours for the plant to fully recover and begin <unk> at maximum capacity again , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and one of the authors of the study . &quot;
We are trying to figure out how to speed up the plant &apos; s recovery from <unk> , which models <unk> could increase <unk> by 10 to 15 percent . &quot;
&lt; p &gt; <unk> and <unk> are searching for mechanisms that plants and <unk> naturally <unk> to recover faster from <unk> .
Their study was published <unk> <unk> <unk> and is part of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , a <unk> research project funded by the Bill &amp; amp ; <unk> <unk> Foundation and led by the University of <unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk> Institute for <unk> <unk> .

&lt; p &gt; Before <unk> this technique , researchers could quickly <unk> the <unk> of these <unk> , but <unk> the <unk> tools to quickly figure out the <unk> responsible for <unk> <unk> .
They would have had to spend weeks or months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plants , and ensuring that the <unk> had been expressed .
&lt; p &gt; Now , in a matter of days , they can compare multiple <unk> <unk> on the same <unk> using <unk> <unk> , a temporary technique to evaluate <unk> function used <unk> by plant <unk> .
With <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is expressed for a few days and then the effect on the <unk> is tested .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> out the <unk> from a <unk> that , in nature , produce <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> plants with the <unk> that might speed recovery from <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> is incredibly complex .
At least four different mechanisms , with different rates of recovery , <unk> make up <unk> .
The fastest <unk> is <unk> by a <unk> between two <unk> .

They also <unk> three <unk> related <unk> ( from a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , and a small <unk> plant ) that are thought to activate the fastest <unk> ; they found that the <unk> from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from <unk> .
- &lt; p &gt; Finally , they confirmed the function of <unk> from two <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which are <unk> model <unk> .
One of these <unk> enabled the plant to produce a <unk> that has been shown to improve energy transfer .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> , this technique speeds up the research process .
Now researchers can use this technique to quickly identify the <unk> needed to increase the <unk> of <unk> food <unk> .

&lt; p &gt; This proof of concept <unk> leaves much room for improvement , <unk> said .
The current <unk> can <unk> only 20 percent of its weight in water , but other <unk> materials could possibly <unk> 40 percent or more .

&lt; p &gt; &quot; Its not just that we made a passive device that <unk> there <unk> water ; we have now <unk> both the <unk> and <unk> <unk> so that we can screen other <unk> , thousands of which could be made , to find even better materials , &quot; he said . &quot;
There is a lot of potential for <unk> up the amount of water that is being <unk> .
It is just a matter of further engineering now . &quot;
&lt; p &gt; <unk> and his team are at work improving their <unk> , while <unk> continues to improve the <unk> system to produce more water .
&lt; p &gt; &quot; To have water running all the time , you could design a system that <unk> the <unk> during the night and <unk> it during the day , &quot; he said . &quot;
Or design the solar <unk> to allow for this at a much faster rate , where more air is pushed in .
We wanted to demonstrate that if you are cut off somewhere in the <unk> , you could survive because of this device .

Why do you run <unk> @ home ?
&lt; p &gt; I want to contribute to a <unk> idea put in practice by brilliant minds seeking to find out on who + - + - + s side of the radio signal the intelligence <unk> can not find a better project to use my <unk> Time when I + - + - + m <unk> .
And the machine is <unk> enough to do what is told to do !
2 .
What are your views about the project ?
We assume we are not alone .
If that is true what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal in this <unk> , we will make contact ?
The current <unk> project only <unk> a few <unk> of radio and TV <unk> sent by a Type 0 <unk> , but perhaps not an advanced <unk> of the enormous <unk> found in deep space , <unk> on a single frequency presents a serious source of error .
Instead of putting all your <unk> in one <unk> , a more efficient system is to break up the message and <unk> it out over all <unk> ( <unk> like <unk> ) and then <unk> the signal only at the other end .
In this way , even if certain <unk> are <unk> by <unk> , enough of the message will survive to accurately <unk> the message via error correction <unk> .
However , any Type 0 <unk> listening in on the message on one frequency band would only hear <unk> .
If <unk> <unk> in the same time scale with us we will not make it : <unk> <unk> is &quot; only &quot; 100,000 light years in <unk> and we sent radio <unk> <unk> in the last 80 <unk> <unk> went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for a come back <unk> would take any sort of <unk> signal that we <unk> <unk> years to reach the most distant parts of the <unk> .
In order for an <unk> <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , their <unk> must be looking in our direction at the time our signal <unk> ( and of course they must have chosen the right <unk> ) .
The chances of that happening are zero , unless we commit to <unk> for a long time .
Then when they do get around to searching in the right way , our signal will be there and they will succeed .
For us to realize that they have <unk> , they will have to <unk> a reply back to us , and that could take another <unk> years to arrive !
<unk> could succeed tomorrow , but <unk> is a long-term strategy .
For us not enough time , we do a pretty good job <unk> our <unk> hope for us is to <unk> in Type I <unk> ...
If there is <unk> technology out there , it is <unk> <unk> that their evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current <unk> <unk> capabilities .
They will be older , potentially <unk> of years older since the <unk> <unk> Galaxy was around for at least five billion years before our solar system began to form and we are a <unk> technology in a ten <unk> <unk> .
So <unk> I believe can NOT <unk> such an artificial <unk> other words , our <unk> could be <unk> with messages from various Type II and III <unk> , but our Type 0 radio <unk> would only hear <unk> .
I do believe in possibility of <unk> , and advanced <unk> type II , III but I do not believe + - + - + they + - + - + are interested to contact us , ( nor <unk> us , their energy output is beyond Earth <unk> ) because those advanced <unk> already may have established a <unk> <unk> for information <unk> , to which Earth will have no chance of <unk> so far <unk> is an <unk> project to try our evolution , at least we understood is our job to listen to the sky and <unk> to the next <unk> is a harder job than listening , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Of course if there are no older technologies , then our <unk> will not succeed .
&lt; p &gt; In the future we may decide that we are indeed the first , that we will have to figure out how to survive to a <unk> <unk> age , and that we have a responsibility to <unk> for the benefit of <unk> <unk> yet to <unk> we have to <unk> to Type I and <unk> from the sad <unk> of our <unk> , our energy output <unk> us for Type 0 status .
We <unk> our energy not from <unk> global forces , but from Earth <unk> already , we can see the <unk> of a Type I <unk> .
We see the beginning of a <unk> language ( English ) , a <unk> communication system ( the Internet ) , a <unk> economy ( the <unk> of the European Union ) , and even the <unk> of a <unk> culture ( via mass media , TV , rock music , and <unk> films ) .
&lt; p &gt; By definition , an advanced <unk> must grow faster than the frequency of <unk> <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every few thousand years , a Type I <unk> must master space travel to <unk> space <unk> within that time frame , which should not be much of a problem .
<unk> <unk> may take place on a time scale of <unk> of thousands of years , so a Type I <unk> must learn to <unk> the weather within that time frame .

Where did these <unk> come from ?
How had they become so <unk> ?
