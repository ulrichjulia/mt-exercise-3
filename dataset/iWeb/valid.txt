@ @ <unk> @ <unk> / &lt; h &gt; <unk> is a <unk> <unk> camera made out of a <unk> can &lt; p &gt; A new <unk> campaign is seeking funds for <unk> , a <unk> <unk> camera that &apos; s <unk> in a <unk> <unk> can .
This <unk> camera is intended to capture the sun &apos; s path over the course of several days onto a <unk> piece of <unk> <unk> photographic paper .
Users then remove the top of the can using a can <unk> and &apos; develop &apos; the film using a smartphone app .
&lt; p &gt; According to <unk> &apos; s <unk> campaign , this would be the first ever <unk> <unk> camera , one that <unk> <unk> so that users merely mount it in a particular location and then reveal the photographic paper to <unk> by removing a small black tab from the can .
After several days ( or longer ) have passed , the can is opened and the photo negative is removed .
&lt; p &gt; Users then take a picture of the photo negative using the <unk> smartphone app , which <unk> the image , &apos; developing &apos; it as a digital photo with proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1,000 units of <unk> are in the <unk> for production ; interested <unk> can <unk> <unk> ( about $ 15 ) or more to <unk> a unit .
Shipping to <unk> is expected to start next month .
&lt; h &gt; Comments &lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> <unk> is coming up with a new <unk> idea as follows : &lt; p &gt; you buy a <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the local <unk> store , get some additional <unk> stuff that goes with it well , go home , <unk> and enjoy the day <unk> the <unk> and eating and stuff while using some smartphone apps to play games or do other things ... &lt; p &gt; Yes it will work , however , the <unk> is way too big !
The <unk> result will be <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I shoot <unk> onto 10 &quot; X 8 &quot; sheet film through a &amp; gt ; <unk> aperture .
&lt; p &gt; Their offering certainly tells me they have n &apos;t a <unk> , .. Or , ....
They just want a quick big profit and with no ability to test <unk> , you wo n &apos;t have any <unk> as they will simply say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of resources ?
We need more <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> in the environment .
( It appears that this is not intended as <unk> of used <unk> ) An example of <unk> first world values and <unk> .
Sure the number of these would be a tiny fraction of the volume of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but for what actual benefit ?
Have I missed the point ?
&lt; p &gt; Which is not the case with <unk> <unk> , at least not in the countries this is <unk> towards .
&lt; p &gt; 2 ) No , it <unk> &apos;t .
* <unk> * <unk> production requires energy ( to <unk> down an form the metal etc ) , and since <unk> <unk> is already essentially &quot; <unk> &quot; , it requires significantly less energy to be <unk> ( nearly &apos; <unk> &apos; ) into something else .
&lt; p &gt; Yes , this is a <unk> product , yes , a <unk> top would be nice ( though they apparently indicate on the can that you can use it to store your exposure long-term , so if you did that you would n &apos;t be <unk> nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , this <unk> essentially zero net impact on the environment .
&lt; p &gt; More six <unk> of <unk> have been * <unk> * in the time it took me to write this than <unk> will ever create and sell .
&lt; p &gt; Otherwise you could just <unk> 2 big <unk> , and do a <unk> exposure with a digital camera , but after you take the picture you will end in <unk> it away with a <unk> sensor .
Does 12 make more sense now ?
&lt; p &gt; No , It seems like a ridiculous amount of money for something you only use once .
I used to make <unk> cameras , if I still had the <unk> I &apos; d make my own out of a can and save a bit of money , <unk> does n &apos;t have to cost anything !
&lt; p &gt; Obviously , when we were kids we made things .
Anyone can still take this idea and make their own .
They only need to work things out and buy a box of paper .
&lt; p &gt; I think this object is an object of <unk> <unk> .
It looks cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of <unk> , probably <unk> to people without cash <unk> who like giving other people interesting things .
I &apos; m sure those people will find it fun .
Others will be inspired to <unk> .
I like the post here that related it to the older application using a <unk> glass lens to <unk> the image onto paper .
&lt; p &gt; this guy gets it .
Should this be everyone &apos; s <unk> camera ?
<unk> on .
This is a <unk> , and it &apos; s goal ( should be ) to be a <unk> for learning via <unk> marketing and ease of use .
I <unk> , some people will <unk> anything they did n &apos;t think of themselves .
&lt; p &gt; It &apos; s not developed or fixed .
The image forms on the paper and you scan or photograph it .
You have to take the paper out in <unk> light and scan it quickly .
It image is red / <unk> .
You then flip the <unk> ( as the image on the paper is a negative ) and you get the blue colour .
&lt; p &gt; @ <unk> see what you are saying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked myself &quot; can I see an image on the silver <unk> paper I which I <unk> under my photographic <unk> , before I put it in the developer solution ?
No .
So , is it related to the length of the exposure in this case ?
&lt; p &gt; This is like the old solar <unk> that used a glass ball half <unk> by a <unk> of <unk> paper .
The sun &apos; s image was focused by the glass ball on the paper and a small line was <unk> into it as the sun <unk> the sky ( as the Earth <unk> ) .
Only this is done ( probably ) with a <unk> and the film paper .
Since the image is <unk> it probably does n &apos;t matter much if the paper was positive or negative , but regular negative paper is much cheaper .

Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of a series .
When you see multiple images from a photographer you get a better sense of where they &apos; re coming for than with a single image .
I might really love some photos by some of the photographers represented here , though I might have a much different idea of the best images from each of them ... &lt; p &gt; The picture that got my attention was the <unk> &apos; s <unk> next to the <unk> .
I thought it is quite similar to an image that was shown in the dpreview &apos; s <unk> <unk> has great images .

Camera <unk> looks like <unk> of fun &lt; p &gt; No doubt there will be <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> by the end of the day , but I am always interested to see other photographers &apos; work and there are some very interesting pictures on here and the <unk> website .

<unk> and sharp in the center , less so at the edges .
That said , all nine of these lenses test as &apos; good &apos; samples .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> lens <unk> <unk> <unk> has probably <unk> more lenses this week than an average photographer might use in a lifetime .
And recently , he &apos; s been busy testing multiple copies of several popular <unk> zooms to try and prove what he calls &apos; <unk> &apos; s Law of <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos; .
&lt; p &gt; Simply stated , <unk> &apos; s &apos; law &apos; states that <unk> zoom lenses are virtually always <unk> at the wide end of their zoom range , <unk> as the lens is <unk> .
Although many of us have often <unk> whether this is the case , <unk> &apos; s <unk> testing <unk> that it holds true over multiple copies of several modern lens designs , all the way from Nikon &apos; s <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &lt; p &gt; <unk> <unk> charts for nine copies of Nikon &apos; s <unk> <unk> on the left , and data from the older <unk> F2.8 on the right .
<unk> in lens design are obvious from increased sharpness and better <unk> across the zoom range .
&lt; p &gt; What does this mean for the average enthusiast photographer ?
Just that if you &apos; re the kind of <unk> that <unk> tests and returns lenses which are n &apos;t up to your requirements ( <unk> , <unk> - <unk> ... ) you can save a lot of time by only testing the long end .
&lt; p &gt; Also of interest is just how good some modern lens designs are .
Compared to its predecessor , the new Canon <unk> <unk> III &apos; s <unk> charts are <unk> .
<unk> Nikon &apos; s <unk> F2.8 VR , compared to the lens it replaced .
&lt; p &gt; Thanks as always , <unk> , for testing nine copies of everything so that we do n &apos;t have to .
&lt; h &gt; Comments &lt; p &gt; I suggest a <unk> that <unk> to all zooms .
A zoom is likely to be <unk> at the zoom setting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide angle lenses , that would be the wide end .
For telephoto lenses like the Canon <unk> zoom , it would be the long end .
People do n &apos;t generally buy that lens for the <unk> end .
If my <unk> holds true , then a <unk> zoom like the <unk> zoom is likely to be <unk> in the middle of the range .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> are not all about convenience .
They are the best option for getting the better <unk> .
And yes you can zoom with your feet but that changes perspective .
If you want to get the best <unk> you get a zoom lens .
If you want the best image quality you get a prime .
But you ca n &apos;t have both , unless you are very lucky the best <unk> is the one with that specific focal length of that prime lens you <unk> you , i have both zoom and prime lenses .
&lt; p &gt; If you said that in <unk> maybe , but modern zooms are quite good , and the difference is not what it once was .
Plus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the exact <unk> you want from the exact perspective you want with a fixed focal length lens , you generally are going to be stuck with &quot; shoot wider than necessary and crop , &quot; and cropping reduces your image quality , <unk> further reducing the already small difference .
&lt; p &gt; not really new for me and very simple ... wide <unk> are best in wide <unk> <unk> are best in wide angle or <unk> are best in the middle &lt; p &gt; No <unk> yet is best at the longest end !
That &apos; s the problem , if I buy a <unk> mm or <unk> mm - I will use it mostly at <unk> mm - so no <unk> if I buy a 2.8 / <unk> mm - it will only be best at <unk> mm - and it <unk> at 200 mm , Same with <unk> mm and <unk> mm <unk> <unk> mm <unk> even <unk> mm and <unk> mm - they all are not perfect at longest end !
A <unk> / 200 mm or 2.8 / 300 mm or <unk> / 500 mm is by far better , <unk> the AF is not as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS II !
&lt; p &gt; Well , you can see that from the Canon samples alone even the latest <unk> zoom is sharp enough for a modern sensor over only less than half its intended area , so I decided to stay with my <unk> because it is at least as good .
<unk> variation , <unk> <unk> <unk> is further complicated by the makers <unk> for <unk> to pack their equipment properly for shipping half way around the globe ! !
&lt; p &gt; You have to keep forever <unk> <unk> how many <unk> of glass ? ?
Its like they are <unk> of what they are themselves making .
<unk> camera equipment should come in strong boxes with vast <unk> <unk> surrounding lens , camera etc .. &lt; p &gt; Years ago when the Post Office <unk> to allow glass through the post at all they <unk> that there had to be <unk> <unk> <unk> of protective <unk> ( not plastic <unk> <unk> ! ! )
between the <unk> &apos; s own box and the wall of the second larger box you must send the goods in .
&lt; p &gt; Ask a silly question ?
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n &apos;t cover at all to the areas of all the wrong <unk> and what do you get ?
<unk> less than half in most cases .
Now go check your very own <unk> samples as I did when I considered it for purchase , and you &apos; ll notice that even stopped down to <unk> levels that the lens is only sharp in the middle .
Then check the <unk> review and figures , and you &apos; ll notice what I and <unk> have said for years , that <unk> and standard zooms are great for all round <unk> , but <unk> for all round performance .
Then go ask a few photographers from <unk> and other reasonably <unk> <unk> , my <unk> group , and stop being <unk> and <unk> ! !
&lt; p &gt; It might be a better idea for you to pressure manufacturers to <unk> package their cameras and lenses too , instead of sending them out in <unk> in <unk> boxes .
&lt; p &gt; Or just <unk> boxes with no <unk> at all .
Or stuck at the top of a box <unk> against the <unk> top ( most <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly bigger box , in <unk> as bad as a <unk> Pro !
Could be a way for <unk> to get some respect here , and help us and <unk> and Amazon etc whose returns would <unk> <unk> most of those samples were <unk> in <unk> , with only their makers to blame .
&lt; p &gt; Did n &apos;t most <unk> claim Nikon &apos; s new <unk> VR was worse than the old G ?
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> , who actually took pictures with it , and not test charts at 5 feet , I mean .
I wonder what <unk> has to say about the new version ?
&lt; p &gt; I said it was about equal or perhaps slightly less sharp in the center , but better off <unk> with less <unk> than the original version .
I called it more &apos; different &apos; than better or worse .
You might give up a tiny bit of center sharpness , but you get a much <unk> image with good sharpness right to the edges .
&lt; p &gt; What these charts show most is that none of these lenses cover the 35mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose the <unk> they are in represents our 3 : 2 35mm FF format area .
<unk> stuff indeed ! !
<unk> do they account for the lens <unk> , as the two sample of the <unk> <unk> I bought at full price and had to return , both <unk> to give three of everything at the <unk> red , one normal and one green even at <unk> , so bad you could not use them on film at all .
&lt; p &gt; The <unk> <unk> is only sharp from <unk> @ <unk> , but at <unk> it is sharp at <unk> .
An <unk> <unk> it is best at 35mm @ f2.8 but they are going on <unk> as on my old sample it is excellent and <unk> from around <unk> , and does not have the <unk> problem noted on the <unk> <unk> I had .
&lt; p &gt; I &apos; m in no way an optical expert ( far from that ) , but <unk> &apos; s conclusion seems obvious to me .
When designing a zoom lens you start with the wide setting because the image at the longer settings will be a <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a zoom lens has a prime lens having one or more internal <unk> .
So , the ( wider ) starting point will almost always give the most sharpness !
&lt; p &gt; <unk> action will also <unk> lens elements , resulting in <unk> sharpness across the frame as the lens is <unk> due to mechanical <unk> .
Of course , this is more obvious with the cheaper zooms .
&lt; p &gt; I suspect this &quot; new law &quot; is just a reflection of a design <unk> used when designing these lenses : it makes a lot of sense to <unk> a wide angle zoom performance for the <unk> ( &quot; most <unk> &quot; ) <unk> .
<unk> it should be as <unk> to <unk> for the longest <unk> , but that would be boring I guess ... &lt; p &gt; <unk> is <unk> what happens under a given set of circumstances .
This is what a Law does .
A <unk> attempts to explain why the Law works as it does .
There is some <unk> as to reasons in the last part of the article ( thus a theory about the Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested ( i.e.
other <unk> for the same Law ) such as &quot; the natural <unk> of <unk> objects &quot; .
&lt; p &gt; This was supposed to be some kind of <unk> we did n &apos;t already know or could n &apos;t easily confirm for ourselves by looking at <unk> field <unk> ?
The problem is that the &quot; rule &quot; seems to apply fairly consistently across wide zooms but things seem to shift toward the middle focal lengths in <unk> .
And the <unk> that one can <unk> with testing any focal length other than the &quot; base &quot; one ( <unk> in the case of wide zooms according to <unk> ) , is pretty <unk> if the photographer <unk> to rely on any focal length other than the base one .
As <unk> admitted in his blog posted , at the longest focal length in the zooms he tested there was not only more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
If I &apos; m spending my hard earned dollars on a new lens , you can be <unk> sure that I &apos; m going to check the focal length most likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it &apos; s even <unk> important to check that focal length rather than the base one !
&lt; p &gt; <unk> what time it is <unk> ?
: ) I have come to the conclusion that lenses do n &apos;t see as much after dark , took a while for me to catch <unk> <unk> are very useful , however , I do n &apos;t believe good <unk> can be <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I am considering the Nikon 24 1.8 as my next lens purchase after recently buying a D610 .
I have greatly enjoyed my 50 1.8 on my new camera .
So , getting the 24 might come before or instead of getting a <unk> or <unk> type zoom .
I shot with just a 50 on film for 30 years so am <unk> a return to primes .
I still like zooms and think my pattern is to either use them a lot at the long end while using my <unk> wide angle often at its <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; Hi <unk> , ... 30 years on a 50mm , ... Good <unk> , .. no doubt you have the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week and a <unk> <unk> &apos; m <unk> the Nikon <unk> <unk> with the 50 experience all over again !
It &apos; s very <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I still have my <unk> <unk> and the 50 lives on my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , .. that would be very nice , .. superb low light <unk> only zooms I take OS is the Sigma <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Everything else being <unk> and <unk> , ...
<unk> &lt; p &gt; The old Nikon <unk> DX was well known for being the <unk> at wide end but very good from the middle to the <unk> end ( I know it &apos; s not <unk> but since <unk> is mentioned here , I guess we &apos; re not talking just about <unk> ) .
&lt; p &gt; I think a couple of other older Nikon designs were <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; .
Since I was getting into the DSLR gear just when <unk> was the hot stuff , for <unk> I thought zooms are usually the best at the <unk> end : ) &lt; p &gt; What &apos; s interesting is that virtually all these wide zooms perform best at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lenses for the wide angle performance .
But many telephoto zooms do not perform best at the focal length you want , the longest .
&lt; p &gt; From what I &apos; ve heard , once you design an <unk> lens , adding zoom capability is relatively <unk> so for the more mainstream manufacturers who make a lot of zooms and electronics it &apos; s not <unk> to just make primes in that range .
&lt; p &gt; All the <unk> and <unk> get <unk> as you close a lens down , so it &apos; d be a lot less interesting to read about and less useful overall as a data point off which to draw any conclusions .
You can <unk> from what &apos; s presented <unk> , or just know that it all matters a lot less at <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; Since <unk> seems the worst problem for wide angle zooms I decided to buy my <unk> in a physical shop with multiple copies available .
After half an hour making pics of things in the four <unk> of the images I hopefully bought the best of three copies .
One of the available lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it <unk> I &apos; m afraid , it is n &apos;t &quot; you can save a lot of time by only testing the wide end &quot; but you should test the long end , as that &apos; s where any problems will be much easier to spot , and if the long end is good you should be <unk> .
Or to quote the article &quot; If you &apos; re going to test your brand new lens , either by taking pictures or using a test chart , test the long end .
If the lens is weak , that &apos; s where it will be <unk> &quot; .
&lt; p &gt; One can not prove a &apos; law &apos; ( <unk> ? )
by simply <unk> all particular cases <unk> .
This is the <unk> problem of <unk> <unk> .
So at best <unk> &apos; s law <unk> is a significant <unk> .
Or just a <unk> : - ) &lt; p &gt; Would think it was obvious .
A zoom lens essentially <unk> the middle of the field of view so that middle is obviously going to be sharper when it <unk> over a smaller area than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on but from the front elements point of view that is essentially it .
The best you can hope for is that the centre is more <unk> in sharpness but the middle will always be less sharp on <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; actually it does - for longer zooms the &quot; wide &quot; part is less complex as it does not have to cover such a large angle of view , so it is sharper <unk> .
This is also a reason why in general <unk> lenses ( zoom or not ) are sharper from a <unk> point of view and also perform better on edges .
&lt; p &gt; it &apos; s a &quot; general rule &quot; , my comment is in the same idea as <unk> article ( if you read it ) .
It &apos; s not about examples and that one lens is the other way around .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> wide angle zooms are much better on the wide end .
And <unk> zooms do not respect the same trend ( I wait for the <unk> article , for a look on how things are in the <unk> zooms ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zooms he will not be able to make a similar claim - that they are best on wide end or at <unk> end .
&lt; p &gt; Something may be weak at the edges <unk> zoom and improve as you zoom in as the edges improve but the centre ( or the bit you &apos; re <unk> into ) will probably drop in overall <unk> because its being <unk> out .
I &apos; d be interested to see if the middle part of the image ( <unk> parts ) <unk> curve is similar to the <unk> in ones .
&lt; p &gt; However there is some general truth in there ... i mean , after all at the <unk> end only a part of the wide element is used .
So that part will have to <unk> the sensor , otherwise you will notice some decrease in sharpness - at least in <unk> testing .
<unk> there are so many factors at play so this may not even matter in real life ... but we were talking about <unk> stuff anyway : ) @ qwx168862 @ qwx168861 @ qwx168863 @ qwx168860 @ @ <unk> @ <unk> / &lt; h &gt; 2017 <unk> <unk> of the Year : winning photos announced &lt; h &gt; 2017 <unk> <unk> of the Year &lt; p &gt; &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> / <unk> 2017 &lt; p &gt; The winners of the 2017 <unk> <unk> of the Year competition have been announced , and the photos are absolutely <unk> .

Only 30 <unk> in fact .
That &apos; s when I took this picture .
I had to get as close as possible to the <unk> to create this effect .
The <unk> is an <unk> wide angle lens with very good close focus which gives this effect of great size .
The <unk> appears larger , and the <unk> of water also .
Also , I did n &apos;t need flash because I had lots of natural light . &apos;
&lt; p &gt; The <unk> photo ... really nice and my pick from the lot .

No <unk> <unk> Adams type tripod <unk> .
I &apos; m hoping more recognition will be given to the protection of the <unk> due to it &apos; s beauty and importance of <unk> life though out our planet .
&lt; p &gt; There is a <unk> side to # 12 .
The <unk> has been <unk> by a <unk> <unk> that has <unk> its <unk> and <unk> in its <unk> <unk> on <unk> from the <unk> &apos; s <unk> .
Look close and see the two black dots of the <unk> eyes in the <unk> of the <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I &apos; ve been <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> # 2 ) .
It was one of the most <unk> experiences I &apos; ve ever had , especially if you manage to catch the <unk> in the &quot; <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , I can only comment on <unk> 2 , where I was using a <unk> <unk> <unk> lens with my Nikon D810 .
The system is <unk> in a <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> <unk> housing , together with a <unk> <unk> glass <unk> port .
For this shot it was natural light only as the water is shallow in the <unk> at around 5 <unk> <unk> .
and the shallow depth allows very good colour to be captured , For other <unk> where I need to use artificial lighting , I would have 2 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on arms and attached to the housing .
&lt; p &gt; Many thanks for your information .
An incredible shot .
In my early <unk> I had taken <unk> lessons but my <unk> said he could afford either a <unk> or a camera , but I could n &apos;t have both .
I chose the camera .
I <unk> not having <unk> the <unk> world but still have had an amazing venture above in my career .
By the way , what was the iso and shutter speed ?
&lt; p &gt; Its a case of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the <unk> to avoid taking one to the extreme .
You can certainly take the shutter speed lower in water than you would on land , if you can keep the housing <unk> .
Though on this <unk> was able to use a decent shutter speed .
<unk> , I started <unk> back in my <unk> , but the photography side only began about 10 years ago .
&lt; p &gt; If you are shallow enough and the water is clear enough <unk> will <unk> the colors .
Otherwise , it &apos; s necessary to use <unk> lighting in order to bring out the colors <unk> .
The colors are there all right but it takes some light to make them <unk> .
No amount of <unk> can replace poor <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; its because of the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the water <unk> and <unk> out all the colour from the light until only the light is left , so technically this pictures are all black and white pictures .
they put the <unk> back with <unk> .
they chose nice <unk> for <unk> though .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some !
<unk> are different <unk> .
<unk> are really nothing more than different <unk> <unk> by an object .
<unk> , <unk> travel differently , and some <unk> are <unk> out by water sooner than others .
<unk> energy <unk> are <unk> first , so red <unk> first , at about 20 feet .
<unk> <unk> next , at around 50 feet .
Then yellow at about 100 .
<unk> stays longer and blue the longest , which is why things look <unk> the deeper you go .
As long as the water is clear , that <unk> said , adding <unk> ( ie light ) brings back all the colour that the water depth takes out .
That is not to say that everything you see has all <unk> at depth of course but definitely not black and white .
Let &apos; s not forget <unk> and <unk> .
A night <unk> with <unk> lights / filters on <unk> is something to <unk> !
&lt; p &gt; These are all amazing , but also <unk> me why I never participate to <unk> .
Art <unk> is so subjective and very rarely I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far not my favorite image here .
&lt; p &gt; These images <unk> about what photography is really about : <unk> and sharing the amazing <unk> of this world with people , <unk> the <unk> of life in all its <unk> and <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I &apos; m not thinking about resolution , corner sharpness , or any other <unk> <unk> that photographers think are so <unk> important .
It all comes down to the emotional response to the subject and the sense of <unk> and wonder <unk> by the image .
&lt; p &gt; I agree with you , but it &apos; s <unk> to <unk> that photographers only think in terms of technical <unk> .
<unk> do , and you &apos; d be <unk> for thinking this when faced with the brand <unk> and <unk> that are the most <unk> on any internet forum , but to declare that you &apos; re the one who gets it is n &apos;t always necessary either .
&lt; p &gt; I know , the camera brand is not important etc , but the fact is that all of the pictures in this gallery are technical <unk> in their own right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <unk> and knowing how his gear works .
&lt; p &gt; It &apos; s not the <unk> thing to say , but it does tell us that knowing how <unk> !
<unk> works might be the better way to get the picture .
Sometimes .
&lt; p &gt; I agree with the <unk> of your comment , but we would not be <unk> <unk> the amazing <unk> captured in these images without quality technique , gear and <unk> .
Look at the camera list that <unk> posted below .
<unk> all are full frame or <unk> . &lt; p &gt; Two or three not so to my taste , but the rest : Oh Yeah !
<unk> love that <unk> <unk> with the <unk> , amazing <unk> documentation .
<unk> I could achieve that level ... well back to my <unk> <unk> images .
&lt; p &gt; dpreview staff : It would be great if you could add a <unk> <unk> <unk> to pages like this .
The photos look much better in <unk> .
You already have <unk> versions : the mobile ( but not desktop ) version of this site is <unk> to them .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been &quot; done before &quot; and are becoming a little bit of a <unk> .
The image that really <unk> out for me was &quot; Out of the <unk> &quot; by <unk> <unk> .
A great composition and <unk> lighting .
&lt; p &gt; I disagree that every shot has been done before - I &apos; ve seen many extremely original and extremely good shots in all <unk> of photography .
But I agree that everyone wants their own version of existing shots , and <unk> others is a good way of learning .
@ qwx168862 @ qwx168861 @ qwx168863 @ qwx168860 @ @ <unk> @ <unk> / &lt; h &gt; Light &apos; s <unk> camera is in final stages of testing &lt; p &gt; Light has been <unk> images of its first <unk> <unk> cameras for a while now .
Today , it offered a look inside production of its <unk> <unk> Test cameras as well as a <unk> at the camera &apos; s current design , as noted by <unk> .
Next month , <unk> <unk> will receive <unk> cameras , and emails have gone out to <unk> customers with shipping details .
In other words , things are getting real .
&lt; p &gt; Light announced its <unk> camera in 2015 , <unk> a compact camera with 16 lenses using <unk> optics .
Its 16 <unk> sensors can be used to create up to a <unk> composite image , and it will offer variable focal lengths from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Light &apos; s website <unk> that the camera will go on sale to the general public at the end of 2017 .
&lt; p &gt; Does anyone else feel that some of those sample photos are fake ?
I mean , they probably have 1 / <unk> &quot; sensors <unk> <unk> due to size <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however in 35mm terms that &apos; s <unk> / <unk> .
Not exactly very shallow DOF numbers !
&lt; p &gt; If the <unk> is achieved by software , one must keep in mind that it works sometimes and sometimes does n &apos;t .
No serious photographer wants to walk around with a camera that &quot; might work &quot; .
This has potential to be <unk> fun <unk> , emphasis on word <unk> .
I like the fact that someone is trying to <unk> , but claiming it &apos; s <unk> and comparing it to DSLR and pricing it at $ <unk> are three big <unk> in my book .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> would come from the &quot; long lens &quot; sensors which are focused to <unk> , and are thus a bit <unk> at subject distance .
It &apos; s the <unk> technique that would hopefully <unk> the sharp subject from wide lens sensors onto the <unk> background from the <unk> ones , most likely indeed with added software <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; I would expect <unk> to be perhaps the thing a system like this is best at .
Two cameras <unk> apart will create <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to create <unk> <unk> is software in a real time that need n &apos;t be &quot; <unk> &quot; in the traditional sense .
&lt; p &gt; However I &apos; ll bet heavily that they are going far <unk> by <unk> 16 separate images you &apos; ll have the ability to effectively <unk> nearly all camera settings in software after the <unk> focal point , exposure , depth of field , etc .
Thus the amount of <unk> in the final image will likely be <unk> in <unk> in a way that &apos; s not possible with a single lens .
<unk> multiple images will also help resolution .
It remains to be seen how it <unk> , but I &apos; ll bet on a small reduction in resolution in trade for a massive improvement in ability to <unk> to the shot you wish you &apos; d taken .
&lt; p &gt; The components may be very cheap , even perhaps the massive <unk> power that must be behind this .
The development costs ?
If we &apos; re lucky , once they &apos; re <unk> we could see developed versions of this camera perhaps with rather more <unk> <unk> , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that raw processing power shows no sign of <unk> while conventional digital camera technology has <unk> now in many <unk> got to a fairly <unk> state .
That means further gains - at least in terms of essential IQ - may only be <unk> and size limited in <unk> .
The technology in this camera represents a <unk> shift in imaging only made possible by <unk> , processor <unk> <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; We could be looking at the future of imaging here - and that may be small and cheap .
<unk> days ahead .
I doubt this is the finished article , but it could be a <unk> product .
&lt; p &gt; @ <unk> - you &apos; ve hit the <unk> on the head &quot; We could be looking at the future of imaging here &quot; -- that &apos; s exactly why I launched <unk> -- to be covering all of the tech behind <unk> imaging which I believe is going to be the future and you &apos; re right , the <unk> will be the <unk> .
<unk> have a look !
&lt; p &gt; <unk> idea !
They could develop an App so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific case and all <unk> , internet connection , app <unk> , sharing etc would be done by the phone <unk> small sensor devices like the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> 16 / <unk> sensor I always though about taking <unk> photography to <unk> using <unk> gear to <unk> the final pictures .
<unk> small size sensors low light performance by using several of them by doing real-time <unk> or switching to <unk> high resolution mode when light is <unk> it all in a small package would be <unk> they have success on this project .
&lt; p &gt; I &apos; m sure you can create some cool new tricks with multiple lenses , but IMO the problem here is that not one of the sensors is large enough to produce good quality .
You &apos; ll have 16 <unk> photos ( <unk> speaking ) to work with .
Just think of the financial pressure putting 16 sensors and lenses in one camera and you &apos; ll soon calculate that they &apos; re all <unk> cheap and quality will be bad .
I mean if you have lenses and sensors that are $ 20 each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &lt; p &gt; And creating more resolution from a set of lower resolution photos ?
<unk> , sometimes .
<unk> in lots of thin objects at various <unk> or <unk> that <unk> the <unk> and it will simply fail .
&lt; p &gt; Not <unk> technical specs and not <unk> a single full size photo is very , <unk> <unk> to me .
If you have superior technology you show it , not <unk> it .
I bet they &apos; re <unk> on <unk> to sell this unit and <unk> reviews are going to start rolling in and the camera becomes a <unk> &apos; s piece .
&lt; p &gt; The advantage of having smaller sensor is definitely having smaller <unk> <unk> could also achieve really nice tricks .
<unk> <unk> small size sensor with <unk> on it can perform zoom better than most single no zoom lens newer phones for <unk> the same sensor can do <unk> in low light with <unk> pictures than my new <unk> &apos; s old <unk> sensor did similar tricks that actually worked in the right <unk> new phones are including two lenses now to go beyond the limitations of small sensors .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they really have to offer when the time comes .
So far is nothing more than a cool project ; - ) &lt; p &gt; Please keep in mind they have not posted a single full <unk> image to date .
All they have posted are <unk> , <unk> down images .
If this camera can <unk> a DSLR and shoot 52 MP surely they post at least one sample ?
&lt; p &gt; Their 3 &quot; full size &quot; images are still only <unk> though , not 52 .
They could be genuine since some of the <unk> this tech is bound to create can be seen such as <unk> DOF on the portrait , you can see that some hair that is at a distance that &apos; s between the <unk> and face is more <unk> than the <unk> is , and <unk> sharpness on the &quot; <unk> &quot; landscape .
&lt; p &gt; No images have any <unk> though which is <unk> by definition .
They &apos; re all wide angle too , so no idea of what &apos; s left of the quality when you &quot; zoom &quot; in .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> to Light for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear negative about such an innovative camera , but there many potential problems , <unk> : &lt; p &gt; It can produce <unk> TO <unk> using a combination of sensors , but the individual sensors are only <unk> .
<unk> the longer focal lengths use just one of these sensors ?
&lt; p &gt; The degree of <unk> needed in <unk> and in <unk> the 16 images during in-camera processing will be challenging for the manufacturers to meet , to say the least .
&lt; p &gt; The 16 lenses are slightly <unk> , but surely there will be a lot of <unk> if <unk> falls on the front of the camera , which it will in any situation when the sun is even slightly in front of the camera <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> - Because images shot at &quot; wider <unk> &quot; appear to be <unk> of shots taken with individual sensors , so <unk> the <unk> <unk> would be taken with just one sensor .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> processing would be far far more complex than <unk> <unk> <unk> or focus <unk> .
Think about it - the images from 16 different lenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , will have to be <unk> without any <unk> .
Also any subject movement ( even leaves <unk> in the <unk> on a tree ) will also appear in 16 different locations .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> can be reduced by good <unk> , but the <unk> on the <unk> will be very <unk> to picking up dust , thumb prints and <unk> , <unk> <unk> any <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; @ <unk> .
Yes they will be taking <unk> image processing to new levels .
Making lots of new things possible .
They just need a lot of data .
&lt; p &gt; Also , regarding subject movement , surely the images will be taken all at the same time .
But if not , in-camera <unk> for movement is already available for HDR and moving sensor <unk> imaging in the current Olympus <unk> for example .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> - <unk> me !
Yes , of course the images will all be taken at the same time , so subject movement should not be a problem .
It &apos; s just that this idea is so <unk> that I &apos; m playing <unk> &apos; s <unk> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So ... some info ... ( please come visit <unk> and <unk> - <unk> <unk> ) ... of all the 16 <unk> ( sensor and lenses combined into a module ) , 10 fire at any one time depending on the zoom level .
See https : / / <unk> / technology for much better explanation .
&lt; p &gt; By the way , for the first generation , with video , only one module will be used depending on the zoom factor .
They &apos; ll use more <unk> in <unk> <unk> - they want to get the photos right first .
&lt; p &gt; I think that most people with a full frame , N / C / S / L , will stick with their <unk> <unk> up or <unk> a bank for the new , Fuji <unk> .
And , the , Apple / Samsung / Sony / LG , people will see that the newer models of their older phones , with known qualities , are good enough for them , and not look for a new model at a , $ <unk> + price .
They have to sell more than <unk> units to go to an , <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; As <unk> as <unk> actually does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be plenty of <unk> willing to get their hands on one , because in such case it may actually turn out to be a huge <unk> in <unk> we have n &apos;t seen in a long time .
&lt; p &gt; However , if it ends up just an expensive <unk> ( which unfortunately is very likely ) , it will get some media attention for its <unk> factor and will soon be <unk> .
We &apos; ve seen this happen to <unk> cameras : despite all the claims about &quot; <unk> photography &quot; , they had so many <unk> <unk> no one found them useful or practical , so the company is now trying to target the <unk> industry instead .
&lt; p &gt; Yes to both comments above .
This company and or this <unk> of the product may or may not hit the market target , but this is the future of imaging regardless .
From huge <unk> ( optical and radio ) to multiple lens cameras like this , the future is software <unk> optical information and delivering images that no single lens ( zoom or prime ) is capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of this soon to be <unk> technology .
&lt; p &gt; for the size and for the <unk> aspect , this is something i am seriously interested in .
i am really <unk> on seeing what this camera can achieve .
we need companies that try new technologies .
i &apos; m pretty sure canon / nikon etc are quite afraid of this having success .
&lt; p &gt; From what I have seen there are two schools of thought : one , wide open , with little depth of field , for portraits and stopped down for landscapes and <unk> .
&lt; p &gt; So , let &apos; s see how this all <unk> out .
Look what happened to , Go Pro , after everybody <unk> off the <unk> after them .
They are living on the value of their stock and ... What ?
What if this camera gets the same competition from a couple of phone <unk> with established markets .
&lt; p &gt; This is an amazing concept and truly and innovative approach to digital photography .
But without being <unk> <unk> or a <unk> , I highly doubt the image quality out of camera will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a true <unk> + sensor .
It &apos; s just not going to happen .
And <unk> by the ( few ) samples I &apos; ve seen so far , I &apos; m even more clear about this .
&lt; p &gt; For the <unk> <unk> <unk> output that <unk> this camera ( as it &apos; s really what it is ) , given its cost , I have to say there there a a million other alternatives with a simple traditional zoom lens that will just do the job <unk> as well it better .
In fact , I even doubt the IQ of this can match mainstream compact cameras with a proven and tried Sony 1 &quot; sensor and a good lens in front .
&lt; p &gt; Anyway , it &apos; s a good try and I look forward to see a review of final <unk> production unit .. that is , if this ever <unk> , which I really hope so as I wish <unk> the best of luck and <unk> them for their efforts !
&lt; p &gt; <unk> .
Here is one of their many responses to disappointed Facebook subscribers : &quot; We understand this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preparing a consumer electronics device for international release ( <unk> , etc . )
, we still can not accurately <unk> when we will be able to ship <unk> to international <unk> .
Rather than hold <unk> <unk> , we felt the <unk> thing to do for our early international <unk> was to return their money with the promise that , when <unk> is certified , they would be invited back to order first in their country while <unk> their original , <unk> price .
And that is what we have done .
We understand this situation is far from ideal but we are trying very hard to do right by our international <unk> .
We felt this was the best way to do that .
You are welcome to direct additional questions to us any time via <unk> @ <unk> &quot; &lt; p &gt; trying very hard to do right by our international <unk> .
, , , , by taking their money , using it and then not coming up with the goods for them , Just like a bank that pays no interest I feel sorry for those that <unk> so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied .
And no they are doing the right thing by paying back people their money when the <unk> did n &apos;t go as thought .
They are NOT a bank and has made <unk> <unk> of giving any interest .
&lt; p &gt; The point is the company tied up their money for a long time and <unk> from financially at the expense of the <unk> .
Remember the product has been delayed for some time they would have been aware of the international problem some time ago &lt; p &gt; I guess the problem <unk> as many of the <unk> <unk> are a bit <unk> in how companies operate and customer service .
I missed the campaign but was interested in the product in the end I would have been waiting a long time even if I was first <unk> off the rank .
This time my <unk> <unk> off .
&lt; p &gt; @ <unk> , if you back a project , you have to be aware of possible <unk> and issues .
And if such <unk> <unk> , the <unk> thing that the company may do is return your money and still leave an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price later , as the problems are <unk> .
That is a very <unk> and <unk> thing for the company to do .
&lt; p &gt; If you are n &apos;t willing to take any risk <unk> and want a <unk> result , then do n &apos;t <unk> , do n &apos;t pay for promises or ideas .
<unk> for the product to be released and then buy it .
You &apos; d think it to be a common sense , but <unk> , people still back ideas because they want to get a final product at much lower price , but at the same time they are completely <unk> to take any risks associated .
&lt; p &gt; @ <unk> , the very fact that you consider <unk> as &quot; buyers &quot; or &quot; customers &quot; shows your complete <unk> of this business model .
Instead of <unk> the risks and considering your investment carefully , you &quot; buy &quot; a product that does not exist yet and then get <unk> when you do n &apos;t receive it .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> , have you ever <unk> the question of producing something to the international market ?
Because obviously you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge corporations regularly fail in that field , and they have very expensive <unk> to deal with that .
Even when you think you have a pretty firm <unk> on all kinds of international laws , <unk> procedures , <unk> fees and so much other stuff , there may always be something you missed .
&lt; p &gt; They refund the money without taking back the possibility to buy the product later for the same price , and yet somehow you <unk> find a way to <unk> and <unk> about it .
&lt; p &gt; @ <unk> - first , the amount of money raised ( remember they only asked for a deposit - not the whole amount ) during the <unk> process was not that large .
Second , they have $ <unk> in money from investors .
I suspect that they did not use the <unk> money .
&lt; p &gt; <unk> , <unk> the money to the international buyers was the right thing to do !
I agree totally with @ <unk> here !
&lt; p &gt; The concept of this camera is very <unk> from theory .
It obviously makes a lot of sense to combine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and optics to <unk> combine them to a virtual large sensor camera .
That does not necessarily <unk> it will be a commercial success .
The price point makes it clear that its targeted to technical <unk> and early <unk> , not to the price <unk> , conservative customers .
Even for cameras having just one sensor the experience of image processing can make the difference in image quality between camera brands .
I assume the <unk> as the first model of its kind will by far not <unk> the potential of the concept in this respect .
That could be the reason why public launch is delayed and there are still no full size images available yet .
&lt; p &gt; The problem is : These guys are nice <unk> , as far as the camera market is concerned .
They should have <unk> and kept it a secret , but they had to <unk> about it too far in advance .
Maybe they were afraid of not getting out there fast enough ... Well , now they have learned that , <unk> a new model for the big guys is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they made a <unk> <unk> , Now their heads are on the block .
&lt; p &gt; I think the iPhone 7 is the first with multiple lenses of different focal lengths .
OK its only 2 .
My point is that it is probably not worth $ 1000 + .
