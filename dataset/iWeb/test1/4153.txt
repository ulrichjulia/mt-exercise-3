@@13585913 @2185913/ <h> Progression of Learning in Elementary School <p> The progression of learning in elementary school constitutes a complement to each school subject , providing further information on the essential knowledge that the students must acquire and be able to use in each year of elementary school . This tool is intended to assist teachers in planning both their teaching and the learning that their students are to acquire . <h> The role of knowledge in learning <p> The knowledge that young people acquire enables them to better understand the world in which they live . From a very early age , within their families and through contact with the media and with friends , they accumulate and learn to use an increasingly greater body of knowledge . The role of the school , beginning in kindergarten , should be to progressively broaden , deepen and structure this knowledge . <p> However , helping young people acquire knowledge raises the challenging question of how to make this knowledge useful and durable , and thus evokes the notion of competency . For example , we can never be really assured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriately in a variety of texts and contexts that go beyond the confines of a repetitive , targeted exercise . <p> In this way , knowledge and competencies must mutually reinforce each other .

For example , the mastery of mathematical operations ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , etc. ) is consolidated through using them to solve increasingly complex problems that teach students to perform a series of operations in the correct order . <h> Intervention by the teacher <p> The role of the teacher in knowledge acquisition and competency development is essential , and he or she must intervene systematically throughout the learning period .

These might involve more targeted teaching of certain key elements of knowledge , or they might take the form of other specialized interventions . <p> As for the evaluation of learning , it serves two essential functions . Firstly , it enables us to look at the students progress during the learning period in order to guide and support them effectively .

@@13585917 @2185917/ <h> Abstract <h> Background <p> There is a significant potential for e-health to deliver cost-effective , quality health care , and spending on e-health systems by governments and healthcare systems is increasing worldwide . However , there remains a tension between the use of e-health in this way and implementation . Furthermore , the large body of reviews in the e-health implementation field , often based on one particular technology , setting or health condition make it difficult to access a comprehensive and comprehensible summary of available evidence to help plan and undertake implementation . This review provides an update and re-analysis of a systematic review of the e-health implementation literature culminating in a set of accessible and usable recommendations for anyone involved or interested in the implementation of e-health . <h> Methods <p> MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , PsycINFO and The Cochrane Library were searched for studies published between 2009 and 2014 . Studies were included if they were systematic reviews of the implementation of e-health . Data from included studies were synthesised using the principles of meta-ethnography , and categorisation of the data was informed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Results <p> Forty-four reviews mainly from North America and Europe were included . A range of e-health technologies including electronic medical records and clinical decision support systems were represented . Healthcare settings included primary care , secondary care and home care . Factors important for implementation were identified at the levels of the following : the individual e-health technology , the outer setting , the inner setting and the individual health professionals as well as the process of implementation . <h> Conclusion <p> This systematic review of reviews provides a synthesis of the literature that both acknowledges the multi-level complexity of e-health implementation and provides an accessible and useful guide for those planning implementation . New interpretations of a large amount of data across e-health systems and healthcare settings have been generated and synthesised into a set of useable recommendations for practice . This review provides a further empirical test of the CFIR and identifies areas where additional research is necessary . <h> Trial registration <h> Keywords <p> **32;0;TOOLONG reviewUpdateSynthesis <h> Background <p> Technology is used extensively to provide and deliver health care worldwide 1 , 2. e-Health ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some aspects of health or health care ) is viewed as essential for solving problems facing healthcare systems of increasing demand , due to an ageing population and improved treatments , and limited resources 3 . However , although there is widespread agreement about the importance and potential benefits of e-health , realisation of these benefits has often been slower than anticipated , often because of difficulties with implementation 4 . For example , in the UK , the National Health Service ( NHS ) Five Year Forward View 5 states the need to make better use of available health technologies and acknowledges that the NHS has previously failed to make best use of these because of difficulties in understanding how best to adopt and implement them . High-profile implementation failures continue to be reported , such as the failure of implementation of an e-health system in a major UK teaching hospital , leading to reduced performance , demoralised staff , costs of -200 million and the trust being put into special measures 6 . This highlights the strong need for those undertaking the implementation of e-health to understand factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interventions to improve the widespread effective use of e-health and address blockages to implementation . <p> One problem with the current e-health implementation literature is that it is fragmented across multiple subspecialty areas 7 . With a plethora of reviews on the implementation of different e-health technologies available , it may be difficult for clinicians , managers or policymakers to locate and apply an appropriate body of evidence for their specific circumstances . <p> The aim of this systematic review of reviews was to provide a synthesis of the implementation of e-heath literature that both acknowledges the multi-level complexity of implementation and also provides a framework for thinking about implementation in a way that is accessible and useful for those planning implementation such as health service managers , healthcare professionals and researchers . Specific objectives were to ( i ) identify published reviews pertaining to implementation of e-health systems ; ( ii ) summarise the data contained in these reviews ; ( iii ) synthesise these data according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research ( CFIR ) 8 ; and ( iv ) provide recommendations for future implementations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of identifying the factors that are important for implementation , and its use also allows identification of areas where there is insufficient evidence and further research is required . <h> Methods/design <p> The protocol for this systematic review has been published 9 and registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ( registration number CRD42015017661 ) . <p> A systematic review of reviews by Mair et al . 7 synthesised the literature on the implementation of e-health interventions in healthcare settings published up until 2009 . As the use of e-health is rapidly growing and changing , and the nature of healthcare systems are continually shifting , an update of this review was deemed timely . A systematic review of reviews was deemed to be the most appropriate method , as opposed to a systematic review of the primary literature , as the huge number of primary studies in the area would make synthesis potentially unworkable and very time consuming . A systematic review of reviews provides a summary of evidence from a variety of different levels , including the combination of different interventions , different populations and different settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews are brought together , compared and contrasted , which allows for new insights to be generated across the literature and synthesised into a simple overview of a large body of work . <p> This update largely replicated the methods for identifying and selecting studies described in the original review 7 but , as detailed , differs in the methods of data analysis . For reader clarity , henceforth , the following terms shall be used to describe the reviews referred to . <p> e-Health technologies ( including management systems , such as electronic health records that allow the acquisition , transmission and storage of patient data ; computerised decision support systems including diagnostic support , alerts and reminder systems ; communication systems such as telecommunication that act as an intermediary between users ; and information resources such as the Internet ) <p> Comparator <p> This review was not limited to comparator studies . <p> Outcomes <p> Qualitative data on factors that inhibit or promote implementation of e-health . <p> Study type <p> Papers were included if they were as follows : <p> Systematic reviews : where relevant literature had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other databases , where transparent methodological criteria were used to exclude papers that did not meet an explicit methodological benchmark , and which presented rigorous conclusions about outcomes . <p> Narrative reviews : where relevant literature had been purposively sampled from a field of research ; where theoretical or topical criteria were used to include papers on the grounds of type , relevance and perceived significance ; with the aim of summarising , discussing and critiquing conclusions . <p> Qualitative meta-syntheses or meta-ethnographies , where relevant literature was identified by means of a structured search of bibliographic and other databases , where transparent methods had been used to draw together theoretical products , with the aim of elaborating and extending theory . <p> And were excluded if they were as follows : <p> Secondary analyses ( including qualitative meta-syntheses or meta-ethnographies ) of existing data-sets for the purposes of presenting cumulative outcomes from personal research programmes . <p> Secondary analyses ( including qualitative meta-syntheses or meta-ethnographies ) of existing data-sets for the purposes of presenting integrative outcomes from different research programmes . <p> Discussions of literature included in contributions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purposes of information or commentary . <p> Editorial discussions that argue the case for a field of research or a course of action . <p> Where an abstract stated it was a review , but there was no supporting evidence in the main paper , such as details of databases searched or criteria for selection of papers ( either on methodological or theoretical grounds ) , the paper was excluded . <h> Search strategy for identification of studies <p> The search strategy , which was replicated from the original review , was based on the following two concepts : e-health and implementation . The search strategy included a combination of Medical Subject Headings and free-text words . The MEDLINE ( Ovid ) search strategy that was used to identify papers is presented in Additional file 1 . There was no limitation of language . Citation searches were carried out in ISI Web of Science in September 2015 and results were limited , in line with the search strategy , to studies published up until 1 January 2014 . Reference lists of all included studies were also screened for additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 papers published between 1995 and 31 July 2009 . The search strategy used in the original review was replicated to identify additional literature published from 1 August 2009 until 1 January 2014 . The 37 papers identified by the original review were also screened for inclusion in the current review ; hence , this review includes papers identified through systematic searches of the literature published between 1995 and 2014 . <h> Selection of studies <p> Search results were imported into the EndNote reference management software , and duplicates were removed automatically and double checked manually . Titles and abstracts of all identified records were independently assessed by JR and RL . Full-text papers of references that were deemed potentially eligible were obtained and assessed for eligibility against the pre-specified selection criteria . Any discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through discussion . Reasons for exclusion at this stage were recorded and are detailed in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) diagram 12 ( see Fig. 1 ) . <p> Fig. 1 <p> PRISMA flow diagram of study selection <h> Study quality assessment <p> Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on ENTREQ statement guidelines 11 and was used to describe the quality of the included reviews . Because the aim was to describe and synthesise a body of qualitative literature and not determine an effect size , studies were not excluded based on this assessment . <h> Data extraction <p> An excel spreadsheet was created for the purposes of data extraction which contained a row for each included review and columns to describe the studies and classify the extracted data related to the implementation of e-health . Data were extracted from the included studies by JR , and data extraction and coding was checked by EM . <h> Data synthesis <p> The original review had used a thematic approach to analysing and synthesising the data , together with an analysis based on normalization process theory , which focusses on the work of implementation . In view of the large amount of new data , and the subsequent development of the CFIR 10 , which pays more detailed attention to aspects such as legislative or financial frameworks , we decided to update the analytic approach to use an approach which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the CFIR as an organising framework . The use of a framework like the CFIR aids the transferability and comparability of findings from this review to other implementation studies and allows those undertaking implementation to access the parts of this review that are of most interest to them . The CFIR 8 , consolidates implementation factors from a broad array of implementation theories and is composed of five major constructs made up of components that influence the implementation of innovations into practice ( see Table 2 ) . <p> Table 2 <p> Summary of findings of factors important for the implementation of e-health <p> Meta-ethnography , as described in depth by Noblit and Hare 13 , focusses on interpretation to synthesise understanding ' , unlike other approaches to qualitative synthesis , such as thematic analysis , which seek to summarise data 14 . Noblit and Hare describe seven key steps : ( i ) getting started , ( ii ) deciding what is relevant to the initial interest , ( iii ) reading the studies , ( iv ) determining how the studies are related , ( v ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesising translations , ( vii ) and expressing the synthesis . We draw on these steps to consider novel interpretations from combining data within the studies identified . Steps i " iii were incorporated into the steps described above . We provided more detail below in respect of subsequent steps . <h> Determining how studies are related <p> A data extraction form was developed to extract key information and concepts from the included studies and to ease comparison between them . Data were firstly extracted to describe the type of study including publication date , e-health domain , healthcare setting , inclusion and exclusion criteria and methods used . Secondly , the main themes from each review relating to factors that influence implementation of e-health were extracted from both results and discussion sections of the included papers . Data from discussions were included as they often contained further interpretations from the authors , which offered important insights and enhanced the richness of the findings . A summary table created from this matrix with key study details , and summaries of main findings are presented in Additional file 2 . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the results and discussion sections of the included papers , it became clear that data were , for the most part , consistent with the constructs of the CFIR . Therefore , these detailed data were extracted from the studies into codes guided by the constructs of the CFIR ( see Table 2 ) . A category for data that did not fit into one of these constructs or for data that warranted further discussion between reviewers was created . This ensured that data were not being forced into the constructs where there was not a good fit and allowed for the CFIR to be evaluated as to how well the constructs could account for the data from this review . Cells within the matrix remained empty in cases where there were no relevant data in the paper concerned . As a way of remaining faithful to the meanings and concepts of each study , the terminology used in the original paper was preserved within the matrix . A category was also created for the main explanations or theories arising from the authors interpretations that were relevant to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and discussions between JR , EM and FS were held until the reviewers were confident that all data were coded into appropriate constructs or categories . <h> Synthesising translations <p> By reading the concepts and interpretations off the matrix , it was possible to establish a sense of the relationships between the studies . It became clear that the relationships between studies seemed to be reciprocal ( where concepts of one study encompass another ) , with many themes occurring across studies which were largely in agreement about the factors that influenced implementation , and from which a line of argument ( overarching narrative ) could be developed . Following a process of meta-ethnography , meant themes from each of the studies were not just described and compared , but rather interrogated in relation to themes from other studies . <h> Expressing the synthesis <p> There were no data that could not be coded to one of the CFIR constructs , meaning the categories of the CFIR were endorsed and no additional original theoretical insights developed . <h> Results <h> Search results <p> A total of 2812 unique citations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2694 could be excluded on the basis of the title or abstract , leaving 118 citations requiring the full paper before a decision could be made . Of the 118 full papers assessed , 44 15 " 58 met the criteria for inclusion and were included in this review ( Additional file 2 gives details of all included reviews ) . <h> Description of the included reviews <p> All studies were published between 2003 and 2014 . Fifteen studies originated from Canada 16 , 25 " 29 , 31 " 33 , 36 , 39 , 41 , 42 , 44 , 53 , fourteen from the USA 17 , 22 " 24 , 30 , 35 , 38 , 40 , 49 , 52 , 54 " 57 , three from the Netherlands 17 , 20 , 34 , three from the UK 37 , 46 , 51 , two from Australia 15 , 43 and one each from Germany 47 , Sweden 50 , Norway 19 , Mexico 21 , Malaysia 58 , Kenya 45 and Israel 48 . All papers were written in English . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were methodologically poor . For example , three 30 , 33 , 58 did not give details of databases searched and seven searched only one database or source , such as the proceedings of a particular conference 19 , 20 , 27 , 38 , 44 , 48 , 54 . Information about study selection criteria was also inadequate : Sixteen of the 44 studies did not specify the criteria for inclusion or exclusion 16 , 17 , 20 , 22 , 30 , 32 " 36 , 38 " 40 , 48 , 53 , 56 . Five did not detail the number of primary studies included in the review 22 , 32 , 40 , 44 , 48 . <h> Factors that influence implementation <p> The synthesised data from the included studies is presented , classified by the main constructs of the CFIR . There were no data that could not be coded to one of the CFIR constructs . A description of the constructs for which there were most supporting data is described below . A summary of the findings is presented in Table 2 which includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no supporting data and thus not described in the main text . Recommendations for implementation of e-health based on these findings are presented in Table 3 . <p> Table 3 <p> Recommendations for implementation based on data from reviews <p> Selection of an appropriate e-health system needs careful consideration taking into account : <p> o Complexity <p> o Adaptability <p> o Compatibility with existing systems and work practices <p> o Cost <p> Key stakeholders and implementation champions should be included as early as possible in the implementation process . <p> Sufficient financial and legislative support needs to be in place to support implementation . <p> Standards for technology which address inter-operability , security and privacy may improve acceptability and implementation . <p> Planning implementation is a critical step which includes ensuring that organisations are in a state of readiness . <p> The provision of training and education to all those involved with implementation is a key success factor . <p> Implementation does not stop with go-live ' " there is a need for ongoing monitoring , evaluation and adaptation of systems to ensure intended goals are being met , benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with strategies to overcome these barriers . <h> Innovation characteristics <h> Adaptability <p> An important factor in vendor and technology selection , reported by many studies from all e-health domains , was the ability of the technology to be adapted to fit the local context 34 , 39 . Technologies that can have technical adjustments made to them to suit the constant modifications of the environment may have greater acceptance and adoption 18 , 35 , 41 , 50 , 58 . End user input in the design and development of e-health technologies should be considered as a way of overcoming barriers of adaptability 28 . <p> Related to adaptability is the interoperability of systems reported by many studies 16 , 18 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 28 , 38 , 48 " 50 , 52 , 53 . To promote their acceptance and use , systems must be able to adequately interface with other IT systems and exchange information 18 , 27 , 49 . For example , a major barrier to the adoption of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place , due to a lack of consistent data standards 18 . <h> Complexity <p> Complexity factors such as slow system performance 55 , software and hardware that were difficult to use 27 , the need for extensive software modifications 52 , the work involved in transferring records between two systems 18 , the inability to provide real-time access 38 , data handling , reliability , slow speed , unplanned downtime 41 and connectivity issues 49 influence implementation of systems in healthcare settings . Often issues of complexity were linked to health professionals being unable to master the technologies that were implemented 18 , 28 . Vendors of e-health systems should aim to make systems as user-friendly as possible , involving end users in the design and development 53 , providing guides to their use 34 and providing technical assistance 43 . <h> Cost <p> The cost of e-health system and costs associated with their implementation were reported as important implementation factors by the majority of studies across all e-health domains 15 " 19 , 22 " 25 , 27 , 28 , 30 " 33 , 36 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 , 51 " 54 , 57 , with some studies citing cost-related factors as the main barrier to implementation 49 , 54 . Cost factors are related to start-up costs , ongoing costs , costs related to a loss of revenue and potential savings to put against these costs . <p> High set-up costs including purchasing and installation costs were cited as barriers to the initial adoption of e-health systems 49 . Financial incentives to adopt e-health systems from insurers and government agencies facilitated adoption decisions in some case 24 , 37 , 49 . <p> Concerns about ongoing costs were also reported as barriers to adoption 17 , 49 . Evidence of cost-saving and returns on investment were shown to be important in ongoing use of technologies 36 , 39 . Establishing cost-effectiveness through formal evaluations , financing of services on a bigger scale , and redesigning business models and incentives were suggested as strategies to help overcome cost-related barriers 20 , 24 , 51 . <h> Outer setting <h> External policy and incentives <p> An absence or inadequacy of legislation and policies and liability concerns may hamper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional level 17 , 18 , 20 , 51 . The need for recognised standards for the provision of e-health systems was described by many studies 16 , 18 , 20 , 28 , 33 , 36 , 48 , 49 , 51 . The creation of standards may serve to reduce health professionals ' concerns over patient data safety and professional liability 17 , 33 and facilitate the exchange of electronic health information between systems 16 and organisations while maintaining data integrity 49 . <h> Inner setting <h> Implementation climate <p> Implementation climate includes the compatibility or general fit between the e-health intervention and the organisation 16 , 23 , 31 , 33 , 37 , 46 , 49 , 59 . The fit between e-health systems and workflows in particular was discussed by the majority of studies 15 , 16 , 18 , 21 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 36 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 47 " 50 , 52 , 55 " 58 . A frequent reason for unsuccessful implementation is that the information systems do not fit well with work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptions that e-health systems disrupt workflows , and the delivery of care , are a barrier to both the implementation and use of these systems 23 , 49 , 52 , 56 , 57 . When there is a good fit , or perceived fit , between e-health systems and workflows , and when systems positively influence workplace efficiency , this facilitates use 15 , 40 , 41 . Incorporating workflow analysis into system design 48 , 55 , the integration of systems into the usual process of care 15 , user-friendly systems 40 and minimising workflow interruptions during implementation 17 may minimise disruptions to workflow . <p> Alterations to workflows created by the introduction of e-health systems may also disrupt established professional roles , responsibilities 16 , 20 , 25 , 36 , 55 and working styles 18 . Physician resistance to e-health implementation is reported by several studies to be related to fear of 18 , dissatisfaction with 18 and uncertainty over 43 , 47 new roles and responsibilities , created by the introduction of e-health systems 18 . The quality of project management during the implementation period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on workflow 55 , additional training 31 , 55 , the adaptability of technologies to fit with roles , tasks and workflows 37 and dedicated technical support staff 31 are suggested as strategies to reduce barriers related to disruptions to workflow , roles and responsibilities that e-health implementation may bring . <p> Leadership engagement at all stages of the development and implementation processes can help improve the effective implementation of e-health systems 43 , 54 , 56 , 58 and a lack of involvement can be a barrier to implementation 18 , 53 . Management support is also important for implementation success 25 , 37 , 50 , 54 . <p> Authors described available resources including the availability of suitable infrastructure as important for implementation success . Infrastructure features included electricity supply 51 , available bandwidth 31 , 51 , access to reliable internet connectivity 45 , 51 , access to computers 34 , electrical power 45 and access to phone lines and mobile phones 45 . The availability , or lack thereof , of time to learn new e-health systems , implement them 25 , 37 , 53 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies as a resource factor important for implementation . Providing a period of transition in which end users can become familiar with and learn how to use new systems has been advocated 39 , 50 . <p> Access to knowledge and information was also important for the implementation of systems across all e-health domains . Education was reported to increase staff acceptance of e-health systems 16 , 25 , 41 , 45 including education around anticipated benefits and when those benefits could be expected 54 . A lack of knowledge and a limited understanding of benefits afforded by the systems acted as a barrier to implementation 49 , 52 , 53 . Nearly all studies made reference to training and support in relation to implementation and acceptance of e-health systems . Generally , access to appropriate , high-quality , well-funded , and easily available training was reported as a facilitator to implementation , whereas it was reported as a barrier when it was non-existent or existent but inadequate 15 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 25 , 28 , 31 , 37 , 43 , 45 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing support to use systems was important for system use 21 , 25 , 28 , 31 , 37 , 39 , 43 , 54 and a barrier to implementation when it was lacking 21 . <h> Individual characteristics <h> Knowledge and beliefs <p> Attitudes and beliefs were reported to act as both facilitators and barriers to implementation and acceptance of e-health systems across all e-health domains . Positive attitudes of practitioners toward e-health systems and their implementation increased acceptance and implementation 20 , 21 , 41 , 44 , 46 , 49 , whereas negative attitudes and staff resistance acted as barriers 49 , 52 . Positive staff attitudes were described as : beliefs that the new systems would benefit patients 56 , interest in the technologies , perceived usefulness and motivation in working with the systems 21 . Negative perceptions included beliefs that electronic systems would disrupt the delivery of care 49 ; doubts that these systems can improve patient care , clinical outcomes or improve the quality of medical practices 43 ; and distrust in the systems 37 as well as a more general staff resistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 51 " 53 . Strategies to challenge negative attitudes included fostering a culture of communication and cooperation , involving the eventual users of systems in the development and implementation 20 , 49 , leadership 56 , friendly and context-aware user interfaces which promote perceived ease of use and usefulness 21 , better education 47 , and clearly and prospectively communicating intended benefits and realistic expectations for the system 54 . The attitudes of colleagues 25 , 41 and patients 25 , 27 , 41 were also reported to influence staff attitudes with regard to e-health acceptance as were staff demographic factors 23 , 46 , 56 . <h> Process <h> Planning <p> Planning for implementation was important for success , whereas the lack of a strategic plan was reported as a barrier to e-health implementation 24 , 27 , 31 , 44 , 50 . The work of planning includes the delineation of roles and responsibilities 43 , securing time to invest system selection and procurement 18 , evaluating other concomitant policy and process changes 40 , needs assessment and analysis , development of a business plan 44 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users 16 , 27 , 41 , 51 , establishing a guiding philosophy 33 , testing organisational readiness 27 , 32 , development of incentive and innovation structures 27 , communication of the strategy to all staff 50 , and development of protocols for using the system and for provision of training 31 . Incremental implementation strategies where features are made available to users according to a plan were cited as preferable to big bang ' approaches to implementation within complex organisations 39 , 49 .

Engagement of key stakeholders in the development and selection of e-health systems and in the planning and execution of implementation processes were important for implementation 16 , 20 , 28 , 29 , 34 , 41 , 44 , 49 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of ownership 20 , 44 , 51 , confidence 28 , acceptance 34 , enjoyment and self-pride 20 towards the e-health system and increasing buy-in 54 . <h> Reflecting and evaluating <p> Evaluation was seen as important to ensure system benefits 29 , 48 , to increase health professional acceptance through demonstration of benefits 31 , 34 , 41 , 43 and to secure ongoing funding 53 , whereas a lack of evaluation and evidence may act as a barrier to implementation 53 . Four reviews included data on the effects of the e-health systems implemented 24 , 36 , 49 , 52 ; these reported mixed effects . <h> Recommendations <p> A summary of recommendations for implementation of an e-health system is presented in Table 3 . <h> Discussion <p> This review identified and synthesised a large body of literature on the implementation of e-health which covered a wide range of healthcare systems and e-health . Findings suggest that issues around implementation are multi-level and complex . All the included reviews reported multiple factors that were important for implementation , and no single factor was identified as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were remarkably consistent across different e-health domains and healthcare settings and well described by the CFIR framework , with no data that did not fit the CFIR . <p> Key factors for effective implementation included outer context , in particular , the need for supportive legislation , and recognised standards . The fit of e-health systems with current organisational workflow was another key factor . <p> In comparing the findings of this review with the one it updates 7 , it appears that many implementation factors are consistent over time , such as the prevailing focus on organisational issues including the need for adequate resources , particularly financial , policy support , standards and interoperability . This suggests that although e-health may be a rapidly changing field , many of the challenges of implementing systems within organisations remain constant over time . However , some notable differences exist between the findings of the two reviews . The original review reported a concentration on organisational issues within the literature . Although also strongly present in this review , the use of the CFIR sensitised the focus of analysis to other factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , individuals and the process of implementation . The original authors reported that very little attention had been paid in ensuring that the potential benefits of new technologies are made transparent through ongoing evaluation and feedback . In this review , there was a focus given to the role of reflecting and evaluating which may represent an increased awareness of their importance in implementation . <p> The results from this review are comparable to another large systematic review of reviews by Lau et al . which synthesised the literature on the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of complex innovations within primary care settings 60 . Both reviews highlighted the importance of policies and incentives ; adequate infrastructure and resources ; engagement of key personnel ; organisational readiness ; individuals ' knowledge and beliefs ; and the fit of innovations with workflows , processes and systems . As such , it seems these factors are important for implementation across interventions and healthcare settings . Lau et al . ' s review found that the perceived benefits or harm of implementation such as expectations of more efficient workflow or lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-health interventions and was not present in the data for other types of interventions ( guidelines or evidence-based practice , management of care , public health or preventative medicine , integration of new role or collaborative working ) . Adaptability and cost were only present in the data for e-health interventions and one other type of intervention . These factors were given a lot of focus in the current review thus suggesting that these factors may be unique or particularly relevant to e-health implementation . <h> Methodological strengths and weaknesses <p> Conducting a systematic review of reviews , given the enormous literature reporting on the implementation of e-health , provided a useful and economical way to manage evidence across a broad topic area . This review allowed the findings of many separate reviews to be compared and contrasted and provided a summary of evidence from reviews which focussed on different e-health interventions and different healthcare settings . The use of a meta-ethnographic approach provided a rigorous and transparent approach to the data analysis and the translation of the studies into one another , which allowed the development of an overarching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although this review was rigorous , carefully executed and employed a robust methodological approach , it has several limitations . Systematic reviews , and also the studies included in them , may be subject to publication bias . Reviews of reviews inevitably result in a time-lag , as new primary data must first be published , then included in a review and then into a review of reviews . Other limitations include the fact that this review was dependent on the interpretations of primary data provided by the authors of included reviews . It was often not clear whether the data came from the primary studies or were subsequent interpretations by the authors of included reviews . Many reviews did not specify whether the data came from clinicians , nurses , other primary care staff or multidisciplinary teams ; therefore , it was not possible to differentiate the perspectives of specific roles ( e.g. nurses ) . We recommend that authors of implementation studies adhere to reporting guidelines , such as the forthcoming Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies ( StaRI ) ( Pinnock et al. , submitted for publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was limited by what previous reviewers included in their reviews , and therefore , it is not possible to tell whether the areas of the CFIR which are not addressed are not important or just not addressed . <h> Conclusions <p> We took a multi-level approach to synthesise data from 44 reviews , addressing factors important for the implementation of e-health across healthcare settings . The use of the CFIR highlighted that the individual e-health technology , the outer setting , the inner setting , the individual health professionals , and the process of implementation are all important for implementation and should be considered carefully when attempts are made to implement e-health into health systems . Particular consideration should be paid to the fit of e-health with external and internal contexts . The use of the CFIR allowed the identification of areas that received little attention in the literature which may represent potential themes for future research including the source and trialability of e-health systems , the relative priority given to the systems , the role of external change agents and the involvement of innovation participants ( patients ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research <p> ENTREQ : <p> Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research <p> NHS : <p> National Health Service <p> PRISMA : <p> Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses <h> Declarations <h> Acknowledgements <p> We are grateful to the authors of the original systematic review ( Professor Frances Mair , Professor Carl May , Professor Elizabeth Murray , Dr. Tracy Finch , Dr George Anderson , Professor Catherine O'Donnell , Professor Paul Wallace and Professor Frank Sullivan ) for allowing us to update their work .

@@13585923 @2185923/ <p> Drawing upon decades of experience , RAND provides research services , systematic analysis , and innovative thinking to a global clientele that includes government agencies , foundations , and private-sector firms . <p> The Pardee RAND Graduate School ( PRGS.edu ) is the largest public policy Ph.D . program in the nation and the only program based at an independent public policy research organizationthe RAND Corporation . <p> Retail clinics are medical clinics located in pharmacies , grocery stores , and " big box " stores , such as Target and Walmart . These clinics offer extended weekend and evening hours , walk-in availability , and short wait times . Many visits to retail clinics are in the evenings and weekends , when primary care offices are not available . The clinics treat a limited range of health conditions , such as minor infections and injuries , and provide vaccines and other preventive care . Care is delivered by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant . Prices are typically fixed and transparent . <p> Retail clinics have been proposed as an alternative to costly emergency department care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent of emergency department visits for a nonemergency condition could take place at a retail clinic or urgent care center , potentially generating cost savings as high as $4.4 billion annually . <p> Retail clinics are playing a steadily growing role in the health care marketplace . The first retail clinics opened in 2000 ; by 2010 , they numbered close to 1,200 . Recent estimates predict that there will be more than 2,800 clinics by 2017 , nearly double the 2014 levels . Convenience , accessibility after hours , and clear pricing appear to be the most important drivers of growth . Consumers are relatively happy with their overall care experiences . <p> But retail clinics have also generated controversy . Provider groups , such as the American Medical Association , have raised concerns about quality-of-care issues , including the overprescribing of antibiotics , lost opportunities for preventive care , and the disruption of existing patient-physician relationships . Conversely , champions of the retail clinic model have pointed to their potential benefits : Retail clinics may function as a provider for lower-income patients and those without a primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for patients who otherwise would go to emergency departments . By replacing more expensive emergency department visits , the hope is that retail clinics may decrease health care spending . <p> To provide a factual basis for assessing retail clinics , RAND Health researchers conducted a series of studies focusing on four areas : <p> A profile of retail clinics : Where are retail clinics located , what services do they offer , and who owns them ? <p> Patient characteristics and service use : Who uses retail clinics , and what services do patients obtain ? <p> Quality and delivery of preventive care : How do retail clinics compare on these dimensions with other health care settings ? <p> Costs : How do retail clinic costs compare with the cost of services in a physician 's office or in an emergency department ? Are there potential savings if retail clinic visits can substitute for more expensive care in other venues ? <h> Figure 1 . Figure 1 . U.S. Retail Clinics Are Concentrated in the Southern and Midwestern United States <p> SOURCE : Data from Martsolf et al. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Midwestern United States in Large Metropolitan Areas <p> RAND analysis of 2014 data shows that the vast majority ( 74 percent ) of the 2,737 retail clinics in the nation were located in the South and Midwest ( Figure 1 ) . More than a third of all clinics were located in five states ( California , Florida , Illinois , Minnesota , and Texas ) . <p> These results largely echo prior RAND research on retail clinic locations . That work used cross-sectional data from industry and foundation sources to analyze the characteristics of 982 retail clinics operating in the United States ( as of August 2008 ) . RAND 's analyses revealed the following findings . <h> Geographic Distribution <p> About 35 percent of the U.S. urban population lived within a ten-minute driving distance of a retail clinic . <p> Retail clinics tended to be located in higher-income urban and suburban settings , with higher concentrations of white residents and fewer black and Hispanic residents . Only 12.5 percent were located in medically underserved areas . For comparison , 21 percent of the U.S. population lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmacies and supermarket chains , clinics were less likely to be located in medically underserved neighborhoods than in other areas . <h> Services <p> Clinics offered treatment for a limited set of conditions for which they had treatment protocols , including acute respiratory infections which accounted for 60 percent of all retail clinic visits other minor illnesses , immunizations , sports physicals , and screening services , such as lipid or diabetes screening . <p> The majority of retail clinics accepted commercial , Medicare , and Medicaid coverage , and all accepted cash payment , regardless of insurance status . <p> Who uses retail clinics , and why ? RAND researchers analyzed details of more than 1.3 million visits to retail clinics from 2000 to 2007 and compared information from that analysis with national data on visits to primary care physician offices and emergency departments . According to the study 's findings : The largest group of clinic users was young adults , age 1844 , who accounted for 43 percent of patients . Nationally , this group made up only 23 percent of patients who visited primary care physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had a primary care physician . <p> Two-thirds of retail clinic visits were paid for with health insurance , compared with 90 percent of visits to primary care physicians . <p> Critics of retail clinics are concerned that they offer sub-standard care and that using a retail clinic disrupts patient-physician relationships . The evidence suggests otherwise : <p> Quality of care : RAND analysts evaluated claims data from enrollees in a large Minnesota health plan who received care for one of three common conditions : otitis media ( inflammation of the middle ear ) , pharyngitis ( sore throat ) , or urinary tract infection . Based on 12 quality-of-care measures , retail clinics , physician offices , and urgent care centers had similar quality ratings ; quality scores were lower for emergency departments . <p> Antibiotic prescribing : Acute respiratory infections , such as bronchitis and rhinosinusitis , are the most common reason that patients seek care in the United States and account for 60 percent of all retail clinic visits . Physicians often overprescribe antibiotics for these conditions , and experts were concerned that overprescribing would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not support this concern . Using data from the medical records of physician offices , retail clinics , and emergency departments , researchers found that the share of patients who were prescribed antibiotics was similar for retail clinics , physician offices , and emergency departments . In fact , care at retail clinics was more guideline-concordant . For such conditions as bronchitis , for which antibiotics are never indicated , retail clinics had a lower antibiotic prescribing rate than physician offices . <p> Vaccinations : Retail clinics have been viewed as a promising venue for administering vaccinations . A study examined how many vaccinations were delivered at the largest retail clinic chains from 2007 through 2009 , what percentage of clinic visits included vaccinations , and which vaccinations were the most common . In the time period studied , vaccinations were administered in about 40 percent of visits ; the most common vaccination was for influenza . <p> Those receiving vaccinations were typically not " outside the medical system " but instead may have chosen to receive a vaccination at the retail clinic because it was more convenient than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they counseled patients during acute care visits about the benefits of vaccinations . <p> Continuity of care : Some physician groups have expressed concerns that using retail clinics will disrupt existing patient-physician relationships . However , multiple studies have found that the majority of retail clinic patients report not having a primary care provider . Retail clinics seem to be serving a population that does not seek care in a doctor 's office but might otherwise seek care in emergency departments . Retail clinics might reduce the likelihood that a patient will go to a primary care physician first for a new condition and decrease subsequent continuity of care . However , patients who visit retail clinics appear just as likely to receive preventive care or proper management of diabetes . <h> Retail Clinics Increase Both Health Care Use and Health Care Spending <p> Policymakers and insurers have viewed retail clinics as a way to decrease health care spending : Less expensive care for low-acuity conditions , such as bronchitis and urinary tract infections , in a retail clinic could substitute for more expensive care in a physician 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not supported this idea . A recent study compared emergency departments with a retail clinic nearby to emergency departments with no retail clinic nearby . There was no notable reduction in visits for minor conditions to the emergency departments in close proximity to retail clinics . <p> More broadly , the key to cost savings from retail clinics is substitution . Retail clinics generate cost savings only if less expensive clinic visits substitute for more costly care from physicians or emergency departments . On the other hand , retail clinic visits could also increase costs if they generate new health care use by patients seeking care when they otherwise would have stayed home . To gauge substitution versus new utilization , RAND followed two groups of enrollees users and nonusers of retail clinics among 1.3 million Aetna enrollees in 22 cities in 2010 and 2011 . The groups had similar low-acuity conditions . <p> Researchers found that about two-fifths of retail clinic visits for these conditions were substitutions for physician office or emergency department visits . The other three-fifths of clinic visits reflected new utilization , not substitution ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on making it easy to access care , it is not surprising that some individuals who might have done nothing about their condition sought care for it because it was convenient . <p> The costs of the new health care utilization more than offset the savings from substitution ( Figure 2 ) . There was a relatively small net increase in patient spending ( $14 per person per year ) . Many payers are including retail clinics in their provider networks and encouraging enrollees to use them . To the extent that the provider 's goal is to reduce health care spending , encouraging retail clinic use might not be effective . <h> Summary and Implications <p> RAND 's body of work substantially strengthened understanding of the patients served by retail clinics , the quality of the care that those patients receive , and the clinics ' net cost effects : <p> Younger adults and those without a regular care provider are typical users of retail clinics . <p> Overall , retail clinics are not improving access to care for the medically underserved ; retail clinics are more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Retail clinics provide care that is of equivalent quality to the care provided by physician offices and emergency departments . <p> Retail clinics have not led to any substantive decline in emergency department visits . <p> More than half of clinic visits for low-acuity conditions represented new health care utilization . As a result , contrary to expectations , retail clinics increased health care spending per person per year . <h> This research highlight summarizes RAND Health research reported in the following publications : <h> Research conducted by <p> This report is part of the RAND Corporation research brief series .

This tool is intended to assist teachers in planning both their teaching and the learning that their students are to acquire . <h> The role of knowledge in learning <p> The knowledge that young people acquire enables them to better understand the world in which they live . From a very early age , within their families and through contact with the media and with friends , they accumulate and learn to use an increasingly greater body of knowledge . The role of the school should be to progressively broaden , deepen and structure this knowledge . <p> Knowledge and competencies must mutually reinforce each other . On the one hand , knowledge becomes consolidated when it is used and , on the other hand , the exercise of competencies entails the acquisition of new knowledge .

For example , we can never be really assured that a grammar rule has been assimilated until it is used appropriately in a variety of texts and contexts that go beyond the confines of a repetitive , targeted exercise . <h> Intervention by the teacher <p> The role of the teacher in knowledge acquisition and competency development is essential , and he or she must intervene throughout the learning process . In effect , the Education Act confers on the teacher the right to " select methods of instruction corresponding to the requirements and objectives fixed for each group or for each student entrusted to his care . " It is therefore the teachers responsibility to adapt his or her instruction and to base it on a variety of strategies , whether this involves lecture-based teaching for the entire class , individualized instruction for a student or a small group of students , a series of exercises to be done , a team activity or a particular project to be carried out . <p> In order to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their participation in the activities designed for the whole class , although support measures should also be provided , when necessary .

Firstly , it enables us to look at the students learning in order to guide and support them effectively . Secondly , it enables us to verify the extent to which the students have acquired the expected learning . Whatever its function , in accordance with the Policy on the Evaluation of Learning , evaluation should focus on the acquisition of knowledge and the students ability to use this knowledge effectively in contexts that draw upon their competencies . <h> Structure <p> The progression of learning is presented in the form of tables that organize the elements of knowledge similarly to the way they are organized in the subject-specific programs .

What is expected of the student is described as follows : <p> Student constructs knowledge with teacher guidance . <p> Student applies knowledge by the end of the school year . <p> Student reinvests knowledge . <p> An arrow indicates that teaching must be planned in a way that enables students to begin acquiring knowledge during the school year and continue or conclude this process in the following year , with ongoing systematic intervention from the teacher . <p> A star indicates that the teacher must plan for the majority of students to have acquired this knowledge by the end of the school year . <p> A shaded box indicates that the teacher must plan to ensure that this knowledge will be applied during the school year .

@@13585970 @2185970/ <h> Abstract <h> Background <p> Pay-for-performance ( P4P ) is one of the primary tools used to support healthcare delivery reform . Substantial heterogeneity exists in the development and implementation of P4P in health care and its effects . This paper summarizes evidence , obtained from studies published between January 1990 and July 2009 , concerning P4P effects , as well as evidence on the impact of design choices and contextual mediators on these effects . Effect domains include clinical effectiveness , access and equity , coordination and continuity , patient-centeredness , and cost-effectiveness . <h> Methods <p> The systematic review made use of electronic database searching , reference screening , forward citation tracking and expert consultation . The following databases were searched : Cochrane Library , EconLit , Embase , Medline , PsychINFO , and Web of Science . Studies that evaluate P4P effects in primary care or acute hospital care medicine were included . Papers concerning other target groups or settings , having no empirical evaluation design or not complying with the P4P definition were excluded . According to study design nine validated quality appraisal tools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into evidence tables independently by two reviewers . <h> Results <p> One hundred twenty-eight evaluation studies provide a large body of evidence -to be interpreted with caution- concerning the effects of P4P on clinical effectiveness and equity of care . However , less evidence on the impact on coordination , continuity , patient-centeredness and cost-effectiveness was found . P4P effects can be judged to be encouraging or disappointing , depending on the primary mission of the P4P program : supporting minimal quality standards and/or boosting quality improvement . Moreover , the effects of P4P interventions varied according to design choices and characteristics of the context in which it was introduced . <p> Future P4P programs should ( 1 ) select and define P4P targets on the basis of baseline room for improvement , ( 2 ) make use of process and ( intermediary ) outcome indicators as target measures , ( 3 ) involve stakeholders and communicate information about the programs thoroughly and directly , ( 4 ) implement a uniform P4P design across payers , ( 5 ) focus on both quality improvement and achievement , and ( 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Conclusions <p> P4P programs result in the full spectrum of possible effects for specific targets , from absent or negligible to strongly beneficial . Based on the evidence the review has provided further indications on how effect findings are likely to relate to P4P design choices and context . The provided best practice hypotheses should be tested in future research . <h> Background <p> Research into the quality of health care has produced evidence of widespread deficits , even in countries with extensive resources for healthcare delivery1 " 4 . One intervention to support quality improvement is to directly relate a proportion of the remuneration of providers to the achieved result on quality indicators . This mechanism is known as pay-for-performance ( P4P ) . Although ' performance ' is a broad concept that also includes efficiency metrics , P4P focuses on clinical effectiveness measures as a minimum , in any possible combination with other quality domains . Programs with a single focus on efficiency or productivity are not covered by the P4P concept as it is commonly applied . <p> Current P4P programs are heterogeneous with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criteria for quality , etc . Several literature reviews have been published on the effects of P4P and on what works and what does not . In the summer of 2009 , a meta-review performed in preparation for this paper identified 16 relevant reviews of sufficient methodological quality , according to Cochrane guidelines5 " 20 . However , several new studies have been published in the last five years , which were not addressed . <p> Previous reviews concluded that the evidence is mixed with regard to P4P effectiveness , often finding a lack of impact or inconsistent effects . Existing reviews also reported a lack of evidence on the incidence of unintended consequences of P4P . Despite this , new programs continue to be developed around the world at an accelerated rate . This uninformed course risks producing a suboptimal level of health gain and/or wasting highly needed financial resources . <p> This paper presents the results of a systematic review of P4P effects and requisite conditions based on peer-reviewed evidence published prior to July 2009 .

Contextual mediators under review include healthcare system , payer , provider and patient characteristics . <h> Methods <p> Figure 1 presents a flow chart of the methods used . Detailed information on all methodological steps can be consulted in Additional file 1 . Two reviewers ( DDS and PVH ) independently searched for pertinent published studies , applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to the retrieved studies , and performed quality appraisal analyses . In case of non-corresponding results , consensus was sought by consulting a third reviewer ( RR ) . Comparison of the analysis results of the two reviewers identified 18 non-corresponding primary publications out of 5718 potentially relevant primary publications ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews , we did not perform a meta-analysis because the selected studies had a high level of clinical heterogeneity14 . <p> Medline , EMBASE , the Cochrane Library , Web of Science , PsychINFO , and EconLit were searched . The concepts of quality of care , financial incentive , and a primary or acute hospital care setting were combined into a standardized search string using MeSH and non-MeSH entry terms . We limited our electronic database search to relevant studies of sufficient quality published from 2004 to 2009 or from 2005 to 2009 , based on the database period covered in previous reviews . These reviews and all references of relevant publications were screened and forward citation tracking was applied without any time restriction . More than 60 international experts were asked to provide additional relevant publications . <p> The inclusion and exclusion criteria applied in the present review are described in Table 1 . <p> Patients as target group for financial incentives ; providers in mental or behavioral health settings , or in nursing homes <p> Intervention <p> The use of an explicit financial positive or negative incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured quality-of-care targets and directed at a person 's income or at further investment in quality improvement ; performance measured as achievement and/or improvement <p> The use of implicit financial incentives , which might affect quality of care but are not specifically intended to explicitly promote quality ( e.g. , fee-for-service , capitation , salary ) ; the use of indirect financial incentives that affect payment only through patient attraction ( e.g. , public reporting ) <p> Subjective structural , process , or ( intermediate ) outcome perceptions or statements that are not measured quantitatively using a standardized validated instrument ; a single focus on cost containment or productivity as targets <p> Design <p> Primary evaluation studies published in a peer-reviewed journal or published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) , the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) , the National Health Service Department of Health or a non-profit independent academic institution <p> For all relevant studies , we appraised ten generic items : clear description of research question , patient population and setting , intervention , comparison , effects , design , sample size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If applicable , we also appraised four design-specific items : randomization , blinding , clustering effect , and number of data collection points . Modeling and cost-effectiveness studies were appraised according to guidelines from the Belgian Federal Health Care Knowledge Centre ( KCE ) and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research ( ISPOR ) 30 , 31 . <h> Results <p> The first two sections provide the description of studies and the overview of effect findings , independent from design choices and context . Afterwards the latter are both specifically addressed . <h> Description of studies <p> We identified 128 relevant evaluation studies of sufficient quality , of which 79 studies were not covered in previous review papers . In the 1990s , only a few studies were published each year . Since 2000 , however , this number increased to more than 20 studies per annum in 2007 and 2008 , and 18 studies in the first half of 2009 . Sixty-three included studies were conducted in the USA and 57 were conducted in the UK . Two studies took place in Australia , two in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study from Argentina and one from Italy were published . The majority of preventive and acute care results were extracted from studies performed in the USA . A mixture of countries contributed to chronic care results . Of the 128 studies , 111 evaluated P4P use in a primary care setting , and 30 studies assessed P4P use in a hospital setting . Thirteen studies took place in both settings . <p> Seven study designs can be distinguished based on randomization , comparison group , and time criteria : Nine randomized studies were included . Eighteen studies used a concurrent-historic comparison design without randomization . Three studies used a concurrent comparison design . Twenty studies were based on an interrupted time-series design . Nineteen studies used a historic before-and-after design , 51 studies used a cross-sectional design , and eight studies applied economic modeling . <h> Effect findings <h> Clinical effectiveness <p> The clinical effectiveness of P4P is presented in Additional file 3 , as assessed through randomized , concurrent plus historical and time-series design studies ( 47 studies in total ) . Thirty nine of these studies , reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . It provides an overview by patient group and P4P target specification ( type and definition ) of the main effect reported throughout these studies ( positive , negative , absent or contradictory findings ) and the range of the effect size in terms of percentage of change . Five of 39 studies report effects on non-incentivized quality measures , next to incentivized P4P targets . <p> The effects of P4P ranged from negative or absent to positive ( 1 to 10% ) or very positive ( above 10% ) , depending on the target and program . Negative results were found only in a minority of cases : in three studies on one target , each of which also reported positive results on other targets 32 " 34 . It is noteworthy that ' negative ' in this context means less quality improvement compared to non P4P use and not a quality decline . In general there was about 5% improvement due to P4P use , but with a lot of variation , depending on the measure and program . <p> For preventive care , we found more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studies , P4P most frequently failed to affect acute care . In chronic care , diabetes was the condition with the highest rates of quality improvement due to P4P implementation . Positive results were also reported for asthma and smoking cessation . This contrasts with finding no effect with regard to coronary heart disease ( CHD ) care . The effect of P4P on non-incentivized quality measures varied from none to positive . However , one study reported a declining trend in improvement rate for non-incentivized measures of asthma and CHD after a performance plateau was reached35 . Finally , one study found positive effects on P4P targets concerning coronary heart disease , COPD , hypertension and stroke when applied to non-incentivized medical conditions ( 10.9% effect size ) , suggesting a spillover effect36 . This implies a better performance on the same measures as included in a P4P program , but applied on patient groups outside off the program . <h> Access and equity of care <p> In addition to affecting clinical effectiveness , P4P also affects the equity of care . The body of evidence supporting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P4P did not have negative effects on patients of certain age groups , ethnicity , or socio-economic status , or patients with different comorbid conditions . This finding is supported by 28 studies with a balanced utilization of cross sectional , before after , time series and concurrent comparison research designs 37 " 64 . In fact , throughout these studies a closing gap has been identified for performance differences . A small difference implicating less P4P achievement for female as compared to male patients was found46 , 49 , 60 , 61 . One should take into account that no randomized intervention studies have reported equity of care results . <h> Coordination and continuity of care <p> Isolated before-and-after studies lacking control groups show that directing P4P toward the coordination of care might have positive effects65 , 66 . One time-series study reported no effect on non-incentivized access and communication measures35 . This study , however , did observe a patient self-reported decrease in timely access to patients ' regular doctors , which might be a negative spillover effect35 . <h> Patient Centeredness <p> With regard to patient-centeredness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cross-sectional study in the US--found no and positive P4P effects , respectively , on patient experience67 , 68 . Another before-and-after study , this one from Argentina , reported that P4P had no significant effect on patient satisfaction , due to a ceiling effect69 . <h> Cost effectiveness <p> Concerning modeling of health gain , cost , and/or cost-effectiveness , one study found a short-term 2.5-fold return on investment for each dollar spent , as a consequence of cost savings70 . Kahn et al ( 2006 ) report on the Premier project , a hospital P4P program in the US , not having a sufficient amount of pooled resources originating from financial penalties to cover bonus expenses71 . Findings for health gain were varied , target specific , and baseline dependent72 " 74 . Cost-effectiveness of P4P use was confirmed by four studies75 " 78 . These few studies vary in methodological quality , but all report positive effects . <h> Design choices <p> We describe the evidence on the effect of P4P design choices within a quality improvement cycle of ( 1 ) quality goals and targets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives , ( 4 ) implementing and communicating the program , and ( 5 ) evaluation . All 128 studies are used as an input to summarize relevant findings on the effect of design choices . <h> ( 1 ) Quality goals and targets <p> With regard to quality goals and targets , process indicators 32 , 79 " 81 generally yielded higher improvement rates than outcome measures , 82 " 86 with intermediate outcome measures yielding in-between rates35 , 87 " 90 . Whereas early programs generally addressed one patient group or focus ( e.g. immunization ) , recent programs have expanded patient group coverage and the diversity of targets included . Still , coverage is limited to only up to ten patient groups , with each time a sub selection of measurement areas , of all groups and areas a care provider deals with . <p> Both underuse- and overuse-focused P4P programs can lead to positive results . However , the latter option is , at present , scarcely evaluated57 , 91 . Study findings confirmed that the level of baseline performance , which defines room for improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher effect size92 " 95 . Even though ceiling effects occur most often in acute care , 82 , 96 studies in this area do not typically consider such effects when selecting targets as part of P4P development . <p> Furthermore , studies reporting involvement of stakeholders in target selection and definition ( see for example references 79 , 88 , 97 , 98 ) seem to have found more positive P4P effects ( above 10% effect size ) than those that don't. <h> ( 2 ) Quality measurement <p> With regard to quality measurement , differences in data collection methods ( chart audit , claims data , newly collected data , etc. ) did not lead to substantial differences in P4P results . Both risk adjustment and exception reporting ( all UK studies ) seem to support P4P results when applied as part of the program . Gaming by over exception reporting and over classifying patients was kept minimal , although only three studies measured gaming specifically ( e.g. , 0.87% of patients exception reported wrongly ) 40 , 43 , 85 . Therefore , there is limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not clear what is the incidence of gaming without P4P use . <h> ( 3 ) P4P incentives <p> Incentives of a purely positive nature ( financial rewards ) 99 " 105 seem to have generated more positive effects than incentives based on a competitive approach ( in which there are winners and losers ) 33 , 47 , 81 , 85 , 92 , 93 , 95 , 104 . This relationship , however , is not straightforward and is clouded by the influence of other factors such as incentive size , level of stakeholder involvement , etc . The use of a fixed threshold ( see for example the UK studies ) versus a continuous scale to reward quality target achievement and/or improvement , are both options that resulted in positive effects in some studies ( UK ) but no or mixed effects in others80 , 101 , 106 . What is clear , however , is that the positive effect was higher for initially low performers as compared to already high performers42 , 64 , 81 , 92 , 99 . This corresponds to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found no clear relationship between incentive size and the reported P4P results . One study found a strong relationship between the program adoption rate by physicians and incentive size100 . In this instance , the reward level , which was also determined by the number of eligible patients per provider , explained 89 to 95% of the variation in participation . Several authors in the USA indicated that a diluting effect for incentive size due to payer fragmentation likely affected the P4P results34 , 100 , 107 . Dilution refers to the influence of providers being remunerated by multiple payers who use different incentive schemes . This results in smaller P4P patient panels per provider and lower incentive payments per provider . <p> With regard to the target unit of the incentive , programs aimed at the individual provider level 99 , 100 , 102 , 103 , 108 and/or team level 79 , 91 , 98 generally reported positive results . The study of Young et al . ( 2007 ) 95 is one exception . Programs aimed at the hospital level were more likely to have a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , these programs also showed positive results , but additional efforts seemed to be required in terms of support generation and/or internal incentive transfer . One study that examined incentives at the administrator/leadership level found mixed results80 . A combination of incentives aimed at different target units was rarely used , but did lead to positive results93 , 111. <h> ( 4 ) Implementing and communicating the program <p> Making new funds available for a P4P program showed positive effects ( e.g. UK studies ) , while reallocation of funds generally showed more mixed effects 32 , 81 , 85 , 92 . ) . However , as the cost-effectiveness results indicated , in the long-term , continually adding additional funding is not an option . Balancing the invested resources with estimated cost savings was applied in one study , 103 with positive results ( 2 to 4% effect size ) . <p> In the UK , P4P was not introduced in a stepwise fashion . As a result , subsequent nationwide corrections were required in terms of indicator selection , threshold definition and the bonus size per target35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects to introduce P4P . At present , it is too early to tell whether the lessons learned from a phased approach will lead to a higher positive impact of P4P . <p> There is conflicting evidence for using voluntary versus mandatory P4P implementation . One study tested the hypothesis that voluntary schemes lead to overrepresentation of already high performers98 . These authors found that each of the tested periods showed selection bias for only one or two of the eleven indicators tested . However , another study found significant differences between participants and non-participants in terms of hospital size , teaching status , volume of eligible patients , and mortality rate85 . <p> Our analysis for the present review identified communication and participant awareness of the program as important factors that affect P4P results . Several studies that found no P4P effects related their findings to an absent or insufficient awareness of the existence and the elements of a P4P program105 , 106 . With regard to different communication strategies , studies found positive P4P effects ( 5 to 20% effect size ) with programs that fostered extensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 112 . Involving all stakeholders in P4P program development also had positive effects ( effect size of &gt;10% ) 79 , 88 , 97 , 98 . However , findings for studies examining high stakeholder involvement remain mixed83 , 98 . <p> P4P programs are often part of larger quality improvement initiatives and are therefore combined with other interventions such as feedback , education , public reporting , etc . In the UK ( time-series study , 5 to 8% effect size ) 35 ; Spain ( time-series study , above 30% effect size ) 111 ; and Argentina ( before-and-after study , 5 to 30% effect size ) , 69 This arrangement seems to have reinforced the P4P effect , although one can not be sure due to the lack of randomized studies with multiple control groups . In the USA , the impact of combined programs has been more mixed ( mixed study designs , -11 to &gt;30% effect size ) 32 " 34 , 75 , 80 , 81 , 83 , 85 , 87 , 88 , 90 , 92 , 93 , 95 , 97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 113 " 115. <h> ( 5 ) Evaluation <p> With regard to sustainability of change , there is evidence that a plateau of performance might be reached , with attenuation of the initial improvement rate35 . <h> Context findings <p> We describe the influence of contextual mediators in terms of ( 1 ) healthcare system , ( 2 ) payer , ( 3 ) provider , and ( 4 ) patient characteristics on the effects of P4P. <h> ( 1 ) Healthcare system characteristics <p> Nation-level P4P decision making led to more uniform P4P results ( as illustrated by the UK example ) , 35 , 42 , 64 , 89 , 116 whereas more fragmented initiatives led to more variable P4P results ( as seen in the USA ) 32 " 34 , 75 , 80 , 81 , 83 , 85 , 87 , 88 , 90 , 92 , 93 , 95 , 97 " 99 , 101 " 106 , 109 , 110 , 113 " 115 . The level of decision making affected many of the previously described design choices , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . It is currently not clear how this also might relate to other healthcare system characteristics such as type of healthcare purchasing , degree of regulation , etc. although one could assume that such aspects also modify the level of incentive dilution . <h> ( 2 ) Payer characteristics <p> Theory predicts that capitation , as a dominant payment system , is associated with more underuse than overuse problems , whereas fee-for-service ( FFS ) is associated with more overuse than underuse problems 117 . Therefore , as a corrective incentive to complement capitation , P4P should focus more on underuse ; and as a complement to FFS , it should focus more on overuse . However , the effects of P4P can be undone by the dominant payment system . A reinforcing effect is expected in instances in which the goal of both incentive structures is the same . Supportive evidence concerning these interactions is currently largely absent , due to the frequent non reporting of dominant payment system characteristics and the lack of overuse focused studies as a comparison point . <h> ( 3 ) Provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both organizational and personal aspects . Examples of organizational aspects are leadership , culture , the history of engagement with quality improvement activities , ownership and size of the organization . Personal aspects consist of demographics , level of experience , etc . Individual provider demographics , experience , and professional background had no or a moderate effect on P4P performance40 , 57 , 99 , 103 , 105 , 109 , 113 , 118 " 121 . In the following paragraph the influence of organizational aspects is described . <p> Regarding programs in which the provider is either a team or organization , one study found no relationship between the role of leadership and P4P performance122 . Although another study found no significant association between the nature of the organizational culture and P4P performance , it did find a positive association between a patient-centered culture and P4P performance123 . Vina et al . ( 2009 ) 122 reported a positive relationship between P4P performance effects and an organizational culture that supports the coordination of care , the perceived pace of change in the organization , the willingness to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than blaming individuals . The history of engagement with quality improvement activities was in one study associated with positive P4P results75 . However , another study found no relationship between P4P performance and prior readiness to meet quality standards100 . One study found a positive relationship between P4P performance and a multidisciplinary team approach , the use of clinical pathways , and having adequate human resources for quality improvement projects122 . <p> Medical groups were likely to perform better than independent practice associations ( IPA ) 119 , 120 , 124 " 126 . Some studies reported a positive relationship between P4P performance and the age of the group or the age of the organization120 , 127 . In the USA , ownership of the organization by a hospital or health plan was positively related to P4P performance , as compared to individual provider ownership 119 , 120 , 124 , 127 " 129 . <p> We encountered conflicting evidence concerning the influence of the size of an organization in terms of the number of providers and number of patients . Some studies reported a positive relationship between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 130 " 133 . Others reported no relationship 105 or a negative relationship37 , 40 , 109 . Some studies reported that group practices performed better on P4P than individual practices , 94 , 105 , 109 whereas one study reported the opposite113 . <p> Mehrotra et al . ( 2007 ) 125 found a positive relationship between P4P performance and practices that had more than the median number of physicians available , which was 39 . Other studies obtained similar results43 , 63 , 120 , 124 , 128 , 129 . Tahrani et al . ( 2008 ) 134 reported that the performance gap between large versus small practices in the UK disappeared after P4P implementation . Previously , small practices performed worse than large practices . <h> ( 4 ) Patient characteristics <p> With regard to patient characteristics , there is no available evidence on how patient awareness of P4P affects performance . Patient behavior ( e.g. , lifestyle , cooperation , and therapeutic compliance ) , however , could affect P4P results . Again , there is a lack of evidence on this specific topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term smoking cessation outcomes , which is more patient-lifestyle related . Results show that P4P interventions targeting smoking cessation outcomes are harder to meet86 . The effect of other patient characteristics , such as age , gender , and socio-economical status , has been described previously ( see P4P effects on equity ) . <h> Discussion <p> This review analyzed published evidence on the effects of P4P reported in the recent accelerating growth of P4P literature . Previous reviews identified a lack of studies , but expected the number to increase rapidly 5 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 135 . The publication rate as described for the last 20 years illustrates this evolution . About two additional years have been covered as compared to previous reviews 7 , 13 , 16 , 17 , 136 , 137 . Seventy nine studies were not reviewed previously . One factor which likely contributed to the difference in study retrieval is the focus of some reviews on only one subset of medical conditions ( e.g. prevention ) 16 , 18 , 20 , on one setting 13 or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary care and hospital care without a restriction on medical condition . Furthermore , the difference in retrieval number is related to the search strategy itself . If one for example omits to include ' Quality and Outcomes Framework ' ( QOF ) , one fails to identify dozens of relevant studies . <p> The use of multiple study designs to investigate P4P design , implementation and effects is at present well accepted in literature 7 , 9 , 12 , 14 . Compared to previous reviews this paper adds the use of cross sectional survey studies to summarize contextual relations . As stated by other authors using similar quality appraisal methods , the scientific quality of the evidence available is increasing 12 . The vast majority of identified studies was not randomized ( only nine were ) and roughly 75 studies were either cross-sectional or employed a simple before-and-after design . However , as the evidence-base continues to grow , conclusions on the effects of P4P can increasingly be drawn with more certainty , despite the fact that the scientific quality of current evidence is still poor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our review draws its results from studies showing an evolution from small scale , often single element , to broader programs using multidimensional quality measures , as was previously described 7 , 135 . Underreporting of key mediators of a P4P program remains a problem , but has recently improved for information on incentive size , frequency , etc . Combined with a larger number of studies this enables a stronger focus on the influence of design choices and on the context in which P4P results were obtained . <p> As is typical for health service and policy interventions , reported effects are nuanced . Magic bullets do not exist in this arena 5 , 7 , 9 , 12 . However , published results do show that a number of specific targets may be improved by P4P when design choices and context are optimized and aligned . Interpretation of effect size is dependent on the primary mission of P4P . When it functions to support uniform minimal standards , P4P serves its purpose in the majority of studies . If P4P is intended to boost performance of all providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of specific targets , e.g. , in diabetic care . <p> Negative effects , in terms of less quality improvement compared to non P4P use , which were first reported in the review paper by Petersen et al ( 2006 ) 14 , are rarely encountered within the 128 studies , but do occur exceptionally . Previous authors also questioned the level of gaming 7 , 135 , and possible neglecting effects on non- incentivized quality aspects 14 , 135 . The presence of limited gaming is confirmed in this review , although it is only addressed in a minority of studies . Its assessment is obscured by uncertainty of the level of gaming in a non P4P context as a comparison point . As the results show , a few studies included non- incentivized measures as control variables for possible neglecting effects on non P4P quality targets . Such effects were absent in almost all of these studies The results of one study suggest the need to monitor unintended consequences further and to refine the program more swiftly and fundamentally when the target potential becomes saturated35 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unintended consequences . However , based on the evidence , there may be some indications of the limited occurrence of gaming and a limited neglecting effect on non-incentivized measures . Positive spillover effects on non-incentivized medical conditions are observed in some cases , but need to be explored further36 . <p> Equity has not suffered under P4P implementation and is improving in the UK37 " 64 . Cost-effectiveness at the population level is confirmed by the few studies available75 " 78 . Further attention should be given , both in practice and research , to how P4P affects other quality domains , including access , coordination , continuity and patient-centeredness . <p> Previous reviews mentioned a few contextual variables which should be taken into account when running a P4P program . Examples are the influence of patient behaviour on target performance 9 , 10 and the difference between solo and group practices in P4P performance 12 . Our review has further contributed to the contextual framework from a health system , payer , provider and patient perspective . Program development and context findings , which related P4P effects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to identify preliminary P4P program recommendations . As Custers et al ( 2008 ) suggested , incentive forms are dependent on its objectives and contextual characteristics 8 . However , considering the context and goals of a P4P program , six recommendations are supported by evidence throughout the 128 studies : <p> 1 . <p> Select and define P4P targets based on baseline room for improvement . This important condition has been overlooked in many programs , with a clear effect on results . <p> 2 . <p> Make use of process and ( intermediary ) outcome indicators as target measures . See also Petersen et al ( 2006 ) and Conrad and Perry ( 2009 ) , who stress that some important preconditions , including adequate risk adjustment , must be fulfilled if outcome indicators are used 14 , 136 . <p> 3 . <p> Involve stakeholders and communicate the program thoroughly and directly throughout development , implementation , and evaluation . The importance of awareness was already stated previously 5 , 7 , 12 , 14 . <p> 4 . <p> Implement a uniform P4P design across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diluted 5 , 6 , 14 , 135 . However , one should be cautious for anti-trust issues . <p> 5 . <p> Focus on quality improvement and achievement , as also recommended by Petersen et al ( 2006 ) 14 . The evidence shows that both may be effective when developed appropriately . A combination of both is most likely to support acceptance and to direct the incentive to both low and high performing providers . <p> 6 . <p> Distribute incentives at the individual level and/or at the team level . Previous reviews disagreed on the P4P target level . As in our review , some authors listed evidence on the importance of incentivizing providers individually 5 , 14 . Others questioned this , because of two arguments : First , the enabling role at a higher ( institutional ) level which controls the level of support and resources provided to the individual 9 , 14 . Secondly , having a sufficiently large patient panel as a sample size per target to ensure measurement reliability 136 . Our review confirms that targeting the individual has generally better effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for incentives provided at a team level . Statistical objections become obsolete when following a uniform approach ( see recommendation 4 ) . <p> The following recommendations are theory based but at present show absent evidence ( no. 1 ) or conflicting evidence ( no. 2 and 3 ) : <p> 1 . <p> Timely refocus the programs when goals are fulfilled , but keep monitoring scores on old targets to see if achieved results are preserved . <p> 2 . <p> Support participation and program effectiveness by means of a sufficient incentive size . As noted by other authors , there is an urgent need for further research on the dose-response relationship in P4P programs 5 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 12 " 14 , 135 , 136 . This is especially important , because although no clear cut relation of incentive size and effect has been established , many P4P programs in the US make use of a remarkably low incentive size ( mostly 1 to 2% of income ) 20 , 135 , 136 . Conflicting evidence does not justify the use of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . <p> 3 . <p> Provide quality improvement support to participants through staff , infrastructure , team functioning , and use of quality improvement tools . See also Conrad and Perry ( 2009 ) 136 . <p> More recent studies , after the time frame of our review , have confirmed our findings ( e.g. to focus on individual providers as target unit 138 ) or provided new insights . Chung et al ( 2010 ) reported in one randomized study that the frequency of P4P payment , quarterly versus yearly , does not impact performance139 . These studies illustrate that a regular update of reviewing P4P effects and mediators is necessary . <p> Some limitations apply to the review results . First , there were restrictions in the search strategy used ( e.g. number of databases consulted ) . Secondly , although quality appraisal was performed , and most studies controlled for potential confounders , selection bias can not be ruled out with regard to observational findings . However , an analysis of randomized studies identified the same effect findings , when assessed on a RCT only inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact the evidence-base of P4P effectiveness and data quality bias may make the comparison of results across P4P programs problematic140 . <p> Fourthly , behavioural health care and nursing home care were excluded from the study as potential settings for P4P application . <p> Fifthly , the large degree of voluntary participation in P4P programs might lead to a self selection of higher performing providers with less room for improvement ( ceiling effect ) . This could induce an underestimation of P4P effectiveness in the general population of providers . <p> Finally , P4P introduces one type of financial incentive , but does not act in isolation . Other interventions are often simultaneously introduced alongside a P4P program , which might lead to an overestimation of effects . Furthermore , the fit with non financial and other payment incentives , each with their own objectives , could be leveraged in a more coordinated fashion 6 , 8 , 12 , 14 . Current P4P studies only provide some pieces of this more complex puzzle . <h> Conclusions <p> Based on a quickly growing number of studies this review has confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and context . New effect findings include the increasing support for positive equity and cost effectiveness effects and preliminary indications of the minimal occurrence of unintended consequences . The effectiveness of P4P programs implemented to date is highly variable , from negative ( rarely ) or absent to positive or very positive . The review provides further indications that programs can improve the quality of care , when optimally designed and aligned with context . To maximize the probability of success programs should take into account recommendations such as attention for baseline room for improvement and targeting at least the individual provider level . <p> Future research should address the issues where evidence is absent or conflicting . An unknown dose response relationship , mediated by other factors , could preclude many programs from reaching their full potential . <h> Declarations <h> Acknowledgements <p> We are grateful to the Belgian Federal Healthcare Knowledge Center ( KCE ) for the study funding and methodological advice .

In that case , however , we will consider the annual pensionable salary you would have received if you had worked full-time . <h> Will the retroactive amount I received be used to calculate my retirement pension ? <p> When you retire , we will use all or part of the retroactive amount to calculate your pension provided both these conditions are met : <p> The retroactive pay adjustment was related to your pensionable salary ( the salary stated in your collective agreement or your work contract ; it does not include the payment of overtime ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5 years used for the calculation of your average pensionable salary . <p> Note : If you received a retroactive amount after 2006 , and you stopped participating in the plan after 2009 , the retroactive amount divided by the number of years concerned . <h> When will I be entitled to my basic pension ? <p> You will be entitled to your annual basic pension when you cease to be a member of the plan , provided you meet one of the following eligibility requirements : <p> to be age 60 or over ( regardless of the number of years of service ) ; <p> to have at least 35 years of service credited for eligibility purposes ( regardless of your age ) . <p> As a rule , and subject to tax rules , you will then be eligible for an immediate unreduced pension . <p> Example <p> Jill retires at age 60 .

The average salary for her 5 best-paid years is $36 000 . <p> Since she meets the eligibility requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eligible for an immediate unreduced pension , calculated as follows : <p> years of credited service for calculation purposes <p> 25 <p> accrual rate of the pension <p> + <p> 2% <p> average salary of Jean 's 5 best-paid years of service <p> + <p> $36 000 <p> basic pension <p> = <p> $18 000 <p> Jill will receive a basic annual pension of $18 000 , which is $1500 a month ( $18 000 12 ) . <p> Please note that if you stop participating in the plan after June 30 , 2019 , you will be entitled to an immediate pension : <p> Unreduced <p> if you are age 61 or over ; or <p> you have at least 35 years of service credited for eligibility purposes ; or <p> if you are age 60 or over and have met the requirements for the 90 eligibility factor ( age + years of service for eligibility purposes ) . <h> Can I retire even if I do not meet any of those 2 eligibility requirements ? <p> Yes , you can retire provided you are at least 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service credited for eligibility purposes . <p> In this case , however , you are eligible for an immediate pension with reduction . This means that your basic pension must be reduced permanently by 0.33% for each month of anticipation ( 4% a year ) . <p> Your pension will be reduced because you will be receiving it for a longer period than if you had waited to meet one of the eligibility requirements for an immediate unreduced pension . <p> Please note that if you stop participating in the plan after June 30 , 2020 , you will be entitled to an immediate pension : <p> With reduction <p> If you are age 55 or over.The permanent reduction will be of : 0.5% for each month of anticipation ( 6% a year ) . <h> How can I calculate the amount of my immediate pension with reduction ? <p> First , you must determine the percentage of reduction applicable to the anticipation of your annual basic pension . This percentage is obtained by multiplying by 0.33% ( 4% a year ) the number of months between the date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met one of the 2 following eligibility requirements : <p> to be age 60 or over ( regardless of the number of years of service ) ; <p> to have at least 35 years of service credited for eligibility purposes ( regardless of your age ) . <p> You then multiply the amount of your annual basic pension by the percentage of reduction in order to determine the reduction applicable to your pension . <p> Finally , you subtract the result from your annual basic pension . In this manner , you can determine the amount of the immediate pension with reduction to which you are entitled . <p> Example <p> In 2017 , John retires on his 58th birthday . He has 25 years of service credited for both eligibility and calculation purposes . The average salary for his 5 best-paid years is $36 000 . <p> First , we must determine the number of months between the date of his retirement and the date on which he would have been eligible for an immediate unreduced pension . Of the 2 eligibility requirements for an unreduced pension , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or over , which would have been 24 months later , had he kept working . Therefore , we calculate 24 months of anticipation . <p> The percentage of the reduction applicable to the early payment of his annual basic pension is determined as follows : <p> number of months of anticipation <p> 24 <p> monthly rate of reduction of the pension <p> + <p> 0.33% <p> percentage of reduction due to the anticipation of the basic pension <p> = <p> 8% <p> Now , we will determine the amount of his basic pension : <p> years of service credited for calculation purposes <p> 25 <p> accrual rate of the pension <p> + <p> 2% <p> average salary of John 's 5 best-paid years of service <p> + <p> $36 000 <p> basic pension <p> = <p> $18 000 <p> Then we must calculate the amount of the reduction to apply to his annual basic pension : <p> basic pension <p> $18 000 <p> percentage of reduction <p> + <p> 8% <p> reduction due to the anticipation of the basic pension <p> = <p> $1440 <p> To determine the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled , we simply make the following calculation : <p> basic pension <p> $18 000 <p> reduction due to the anticipation of the basic pension <p> <p> $1440 <p> immediate pension with reduction <p> = <p> $16 560 <p> Johns annual pension will be $16 560 , which is $1380 a month ( $16 560 12 ) . <h> Is it possible to minimize or completely avoid the reduction ? <p> Yes . This is what we call the compensation of the reduction due to the anticipation of a pension . It consists in transferring to the RREGOP the amount necessary for your plan to pay you an amount equal to the reduction you wish to avoid , annually . <p> The funds must be transferred from your registered retirement savings plan ( RRSP ) or a registered pension plan ( RPP ) , in accordance with tax rules , within 60 days of the end of your participation . Your employer may also pay the amount required to eliminate or minimize the reduction of your pension , on the date on which you cease to be covered by the plan at the latest .

The possibility of strengthening the largest component of the health care workforcenursesto become partners and leaders in improving the delivery of care and the health care system as a whole inspired the IOM to partner with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ( RWJF ) in creating the RWJF Initiative on the Future of Nursing , at the IOM . In this partnership , the IOM and RWJF were in agreement that accessible , high-quality care can not be achieved without exceptional nursing care and leadership . By working together , the two organizations sought to bring more credibility and visibility to the topic than either could by working alone . The organizations merged staff and resources in an unprecedented partnership to explore challenges central to the future of the nursing profession . <p> To support this collaborative effort , the IOM welcomed staff from RWJF , as loaned employees , to provide specific content expertise in nursing , research , and communications . Combining staff from two different organizations was an experiment that integrated best practices from both organizations and inspired us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Their work will serve as a blueprint for how the nursing profession can transform itself into an ever more potent and relevant force for lasting solutions to enhance the quality and value of U.S. health care in ways that will meet the future health needs of diverse populations . The report calls on nurses , individually and as a profession , to embrace changes needed to promote health , prevent illness , and care for people in all settings across the lifespan . The nursing profession can not make these changes on its own , however . The report calls for multisector support and interprofessional collaboration . In this sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers to work with nurses to make the changes needed for a more accessible , cost-effective , and high-quality health care system . <p> Since its foundation 40 years ago , the IOM has produced many reports echoing the theme of high-quality , safe , effective , evidence-based , and patient-centered care . The present report expands on this theme by addressing the critical role of nursing . It demonstrates that achieving a successful health care system in the future rests on the future of nursing . <h> Preface <p> This report is being published at a time of great opportunity in health care . Legislation passed in March 2010 will provide insurance coverage for 32 million more Americans . The implications of this new demand on the nations health care system are significant . How can the system accommodate the increased demand while improving the quality of health care services provided to the American public ? <p> Nursing represents the largest sector of the health professions , with more than 3 million registered nurses in the United States . The question presented to the committee that produced this report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing demand for safe , high-quality , and effective health care services ? In the near term , the new health care laws identify great challenges in the management of chronic conditions , primary care ( including care coordination and transitional care ) , prevention and wellness , and the prevention of adverse events ( such as hospital-acquired infections ) . The demand for better provision of mental health services , school health services , long-term care , and palliative care ( including end-of-life care ) is increasing as well . Whether improvements in all these areas of care will slow the rate of growth in health care expenditures remains to be seen ; however , experts believe they will result in better health outcomes . <p> What nursing brings to the future is a steadfast commitment to patient care , improved safety and quality , and better outcomes . Most of the near-term challenges identified in the health care reform legislation speak to traditional and current strengths of the nursing profession in such areas as care coordination , health promotion , and quality improvement . How well nurses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care quality measures that have been <p> targeted for improvement over the past few years . Thus for nursing , health care reform provides an opportunity for the profession to meet the demand for safe , high-quality , patient-centered , and equitable health care services . We believe nurses have key roles to play as team members and leaders for a reformed and better-integrated , patient-centered health care system . <p> This report begins with the assumption that nursing can fill such new and expanded roles in a redesigned health care system . To take advantage of these opportunities , however , nurses must be allowed to practice in accordance with their professional training , and the education they receive must better prepare them to deliver patient-centered , equitable , safe , high-quality health care services . Additionally , they must engage with physicians and other health care professionals to deliver efficient and effective care and assume leadership roles in the redesign of the health care system . In particular , we believe that preparation of an expanded workforce , necessary to serve the millions who will now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require changes in nursing scopes of practice , advances in the education of nurses across all levels , improvements in the practice of nursing across the continuum of care , transformation in the utilization of nurses across settings , and leadership at all levels so nurses can be deployed effectively and appropriately as partners in the health care team . <p> In 2008 , the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ( RWJF ) approached the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) to propose a partnership between the two organizations to assess and respond to the need to transform the nursing profession to meet these challenges . The resulting collaborative partnership created a unique blend of organizational expertise and content expertise , drawing on the IOMs mission to serve as adviser to the nation to improve health and RWJFs longstanding commitment to ensuring that the nursing workforce has the necessary capacity , in terms of numbers , skills , and competence , to meet the present and future health care needs of the public . Recognizing that the nursing profession faces the challenges outlined above , RWJF and the IOM established a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the initiative is the work of this IOM committee . The Committee on the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative on the Future of Nursing , at the Institute of Medicine was tasked with producing a report containing recommendations for an action-oriented blueprint for the future of nursing , including changes in public and institutional policies at the national , state , and local levels .

In addition to the workshops , forums , and site visits , the committee collected testimony and welcomed public input throughout the study process , conducted a literature review , and commissioned a series of papers from a research network of esteemed colleagues . <p> For this committee , the IOM assembled an extraordinary group of professionals , including experts from areas such as business , academia , health care delivery , and health policy . The team brought diverse perspectives to the table that went well outside the nursing profession . Most of the members did not have a degree in nursing and were not involved in nursing education , practice , research , or governance .

@@13585992 @2185992/ <h> Abstract <p> The importance of health research utilisation in policy-making , and of understanding the mechanisms involved , is increasingly recognised . Recent reports calling for more resources to improve health in developing countries , and global pressures for accountability , draw greater attention to research-informed policy-making . Key utilisation issues have been described for at least twenty years , but the growing focus on health research systems creates additional dimensions . <p> The utilisation of health research in policy-making should contribute to policies that may eventually lead to desired outcomes , including health gains . In this article , exploration of these issues is combined with a review of various forms of policy-making . When this is linked to analysis of different types of health research , it assists in building a comprehensive account of the diverse meanings of research utilisation . <p> Previous studies report methods and conceptual frameworks that have been applied , if with varying degrees of success , to record utilisation in policy-making . These studies reveal various examples of research impact within a general picture of underutilisation . <p> Factors potentially enhancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; activities of the health research system at the interface between research and policy-making ; and the role of the recipients , or ' receptors ' , of health research . An interfaces and receptors model provides a framework for analysis . <p> Recommendations about possible methods for assessing health research utilisation follow identification of the purposes of such assessments . Our conclusion is that research utilisation can be better understood , and enhanced , by developing assessment methods informed by conceptual analysis and review of previous studies . <h> Review <h> Introduction and Background <p> The Director General of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has decided that the World Health Report 2004 , Health Research : Knowledge for Better Health , should involve a careful reflection of how advances in health research lead to improved health and health equity . The WHO has launched a broad Health Research Systems Analysis ( HRSA ) Initiative that will inform the 2004 report . One component of this initiative is a project focusing on the assessment of health research utilisation . The utilisation project itself consists of various elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of WHO , Geneva , to review the issues related to the utilisation of health research in policy-making , and , based on that review , make recommendations about appropriate methods for assessment of such utilisation . <p> WHO is giving increased emphasis to the role of health systems 1 and attention is focusing on the importance of policy-making in achieving effective health systems 2 , 3 . The World Bank made estimates of the costs of attaining the health-related Millennium Development Goals of between $20 and $25 billion a year . However , the report notes that : ' these unit cost estimates only apply when the policy and institutional environment is conducive to additional health spending being effective ' 2 . The importance of health policy-making , in turn , being research-informed is recognised by a growing number of bodies 3 " 5 . <p> The existence of relevant research , though necessary , is not sufficient . Evidence-based policy is difficult to achieve and it is widely agreed that health policies do not reflect research evidence to the extent that in theory they could 5 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extremely complex , with many genuine obstacles to evidence-based policy-making at the same time as there are factors that could increase research utilisation . A full review of the many possible meanings of research impact reveals that there may be more utilisation in policy-making than is sometimes recognised . Such a review also enhances understanding of the issues , including the differential scope for utilisation associated with different types of research and policy environments . Developing a conceptual framework of the processes of utilisation should assist with the formulation of assessment tools that reveal the full picture of the way research is used in policy-making . Furthermore , it should allow the growing demands for accountability for research expenditure 12 " 18 to be addressed appropriately , which could also be of benefit to the research community . <p> There is a rich background of material for each of these areas , including key contributions from Weiss identifying the multiple meanings that can be attached to research utilisation in policy-making 19 . Their importance lies in the fact that some of these meanings , or models , point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research exploitation which involves research findings being directly used in policy formulation . <p> About twenty years ago there was recognition of the need for analysis to combine a range of factors such as the nature of different types of health research knowledge and the diverse institutional arrangements for policy-making . In their assessment of the attempt in the 1970s to increase utilisation of research funded by the UK 's Department of Health , Kogan and Henkel found , ' the interconnections between epistemologies and institutional relationships were a recurring theme ' 7 . The importance of interactions across the interfaces between researchers and policy-makers was identified . The role of policy-makers as the receivers , or receptors , of research and the need for careful priority setting were highlighted . Various elements of this analysis were recently reported also to be relevant for health research in Mexico 10 . <p> The context of the current move to attempt to increase research utilisation is important . There is now a broad coalition pressing for improvements . Various organisations came together in 2000 to support the formation of the Alliance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It aims to promote capacity building for , and the dissemination and impact of , research both on and for policy 20 . At the level of specific programmes within international bodies , there is a growing stress on the role of policy-making : ' Research on implementation , on policy-making or programme development is as important as basic clinical research for improving child health ' 21 . Recent weeks have seen publication of the first systematic review to address research utilisation in policy-making 22 . Furthermore , the developing interest in research informed policy-making coincides with the extensive efforts being made to increase the implementation of health research findings more generally . Indeed , the emphasis on evidence-based medicine is itself generating extra pressure from practitioners that policy-makers , too , should have a duty to consider research evidence 23 . The role of research utilisation in policy-making is seen as a key element in the growing interest within WHO on research utilisation and its assessment 3 , 24 . <p> A further important part of the context is that developments in the UK in the 1970s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early attempts to develop a system to augment the traditional individualistic determination of medical research priorities in universities and hospitals . A similar emphasis on issues such as priority setting is seen in recommendations made for middle and low income countries by the Commission on Health Research for Development 26 . The concept of Health Research Systems ( HRSs ) is now of growing significance 27 . One of the main elements that distinguishes a HRS is the attempt to develop mechanisms and networks to facilitate the greater use of health research . <p> Building on the above analysis , it is our contention that many factors need to be brought together if assessment of research impact on policy-making is to contribute to an understanding of the issues and an enhancement of utilisation . The prime focus should be the policy-maker . This paper first examines the concept of policy-making , and the underlying assumption that it is better if it is research-informed . Then we consider the range of types of health research and the levels of policy-making at which they could be applied . These strands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ways in which research can have an impact on health policy-making . <p> The focus then moves to examining contributions from previous studies of knowledge utilisation in health policy-making , including those using standardised measures . Various dimensions of our conceptual analysis form the next sections . We start with the interfaces , both at the priority setting stage and when findings are communicated between researchers and policy-makers . The role of policy-makers as receivers , or receptors , of research is examined along with the accompanying institutional arrangements . Incentives are also important . The material is brought together in a wide-ranging interfaces and receptor model of research utilisation in policy making . Finally , the various possible purposes of assessment of research utilisation are considered before suggestions are made about suitable methods for assessing the impact of research on policy-making . Such assessments would be best undertaken as part of a wider evaluation of the utilisation of health research by industry , medical practitioners and the public . <h> The nature of policy-making and its role in knowledge utilisation <p> Policy-making can be viewed as involving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted broadly can include people making the policy as government ministers and officials , as local health service managers , or as representatives of a professional body . Policy-making involves those in positions of authority making choices that have a special status within the group to which they will apply . The results take many forms ranging from national health policies made by the government to clinical guidelines determined by professional bodies . This broad usage of the term policy-making has advantages when conducting knowledge utilisation or payback assessments , and has contributed to a conceptual framework for a series of such studies 14 , 17 , 29 . In this article , however , the analysis mainly concentrates on public policy-making rather than that undertaken by professional bodies . <p> This framework consists of two elements . These are a multidimensional categorisation of benefits from health research , going through from the primary and secondary outputs to the final outcomes , and a model of how to assess them . A revised version of the model is shown as Figure 1 and consists of a series of stages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research project could be utilised , in policy-making and practice , in ways that result in final outcomes such as health gains and economic benefits . Public engagement with research can play a key role in research utilisation . The model incorporates the concept of the stock , or pool , of knowledge and the idea that there are various interfaces between research and the wider political , professional and social environments . These points , together with various feedback loops and forward leaps , mean that although the stages are presented in a linear form , the model recognises that the actual steps involved in utilisation and achieving final outcomes are often multidirectional and convoluted . That said , the model helps both to organise assessments and to indicate where the various elements of the multidimensional categorisation of benefits might occur . <p> Figure 1 <p> The Place of Policy-Making in the Stages of Assessment of Research Utilisation and Final Outcomes . <p> Key : <p> Direct lines within the flow or feedback <p> Indirect lines of communication <p> Primary Outputs " Publications , trained researchers <p> Secondary Outputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The framework is also important for the structure of this article because it demonstrates that assessment of research impact on policy-making is best undertaken as part of a wider analysis of the utilisation of research . Throughout the paper it will become increasingly clear that policy-making is itself influenced by industry , by health professionals who might be expected to apply research findings in their practice , and by the public who might engage with research , either as patients or more generally in society . The interaction of all these groups with research findings is an important consideration and the interfaces operate at many levels . <p> In terms of the utilisation of the knowledge , research-informed policies can be referred to as secondary outputs from research 14 . This distinguishes them from the primary , or direct , outputs of research processes such as journal articles , other publications , and trained researchers . Neither , however , are the policies the desired final outcomes ; they represent a step in the process . It is sometimes possible to identify how research findings have informed policy-making even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages in the utilisation processes . Furthermore , the approach enables the processes of research utilisation to be identified in ways that would be impossible if the analysis attempted to jump immediately to the final outcomes . In particular , detailed analysis at this stage can address the counterfactual , ie consider what might have happened without the relevant research : would the policy have been changed anyway ? <p> Not all examples of health knowledge utilisation go through a policy-making stage , and in some cases the policy comes after partial translation of the findings into practice . For example , clinical guidelines are usually developed after leading clinicians in the field have already adopted an evidence-based practice and then seek to encourage its wider diffusion throughout the profession . Nevertheless , often a policy-making stage in knowledge utilisation is important if the final outcomes of health , health equity , and social and economic gain are to be achieved . The potential importance of a policy stage in the process of turning evidence into application is increasingly being accepted , even for clinical practice 30 . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make to policy-making . The basic assumption of knowledge utilisation related to policy-making is that policies which are research informed will be better than otherwise would have been the case . It is assumed that research exposes policy-making to a wider range of validated concepts and experiences than those that can be drawn from the normal time-limited and politically constrained processes of policy deliberation . It thus allows a broader choice of policy options to emerge . Research often enables policies to be generated upon technically well-informed bases . It gives warnings of reasons why some policies succeed and others fail . It can make connections between otherwise separate factors such as the nature of the substantive field and organisational patterns set up to manage them , or the power of environments over health outcomes . It legitimises some policies and throws legitimate doubts on others . Analysis of policy-making , and of research utilisation , often identifies at least three broad areas of activity : policy agenda setting , policy formulation , and policy implementation 11 , 31 . Potentially , research could play a part in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important activity , and one that adopts a research approach . Indeed , in this paper evaluation is primarily being viewed as a form of research , the utilisation of which will be examined in the other phases of policy-making . <p> Davies and Nutley , in a recent analysis of the role of evidence , or ' What Works ' , in a series of public services , suggest ' the research community in healthcare is truly global , and the drive to evidence-based policy and practice is pandemic ' 32 . Of the public services , health care is seen as the one where , despite the difficulties , the utilisation of knowledge is most advanced . Although this analysis does examine a range of policy-making models , critics claim that the theoretical basis for evidence-based policy-making is not strong because it rests too much on a rational view of policy-making 33 , 34 . The debate needs to be informed by various models of policy-making such as those set out below . <p> Many categorisations of policy-making exist . The categorisation of policy-making presented here is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on previous analyses of public policy-making that were specifically made in the process of analysing research utilisation . The categorisation incorporates work undertaken by Kogan and Tuijnman 35 , for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , and by many others 9 , 36 " 38 . The various models described are not mutually exclusive , but are included because each makes a specific contribution that is built on in later analysis : <h> Rational models <p> Rational models of policy-making assume policy-makers identify problems , then gather and review all the data about alternative possible solutions , and their consequences , and select the solution that best matches their goals . Sometimes this approach is known as ends-means rationality ; it is thus different from some of the models below which might , nevertheless , also seem rational to the policy-makers involved . The various models of policy-making should be seen as a spectrum . Thus Simon 39 is sometimes seen as writing from the rationalist tradition , but he was critical of the more basic rational models and his concept of ' bounded rationality ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of possible solutions . <h> Incrementalist models <p> It has long been recognised that policy-making is a complex process . It can involve scientific knowledge and a range of other factors including interests , values , established positions within institutions , and personal ambitions . Furthermore , evidence from research has to compete with what Lindblom and Cohen 40 call ' ordinary knowledge ' which owes its origins to , ' common sense , casual empiricism , or thoughtful speculation and analysis ' . In models such as ' disjointed incrementalism ' 41 policy-making does not involve a clear movement towards predetermined goals but rather is more a series of small steps in a process of ' muddling through ' 42 or ' decision accretion ' 43 . Incrementalists allow for a greater role for interests in policy-making debates and emphasise the many sources of information that impinge on policy-makers . <h> Networks <p> A networks approach also highlights the role of different interests and how the relationships between such groups and policy-makers can result in an incremental policy process . The term ' policy network ' is defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group relationships , for example ' policy communities ' in which the long term relationships between government officials and representatives of leading interest groups are particularly powerful 44 " 46 . Other definitions of the term networks involve a wider membership and are more likely to include researchers . It is claimed that researcher involvement in ' social networks ' 47 is important for research utilisation . Others suggest that leading experts who share a similar approach on an issue can be seen as an ' epistemic community ' 48 and can influence policy . Analysis of health systems often suggests the influence of the medical profession over policy-making is particularly strong 49 . Its domination of the policy networks led to the use of the term ' a professionalised policy network ' 50 , 51 . Its influence is likely to be a factor in setting agendas and determining the type of knowledge to which most notice is taken in the policy debate . <h> The ' garbage can ' model <p> The ' garbage can ' model of policy-making 52 looks at these issues in an idiosyncratic way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgarded nevertheless remain in the policy-making system , and occasionally there are problems to which they become attached . Models such as this highlight the way in which policy-making can be seen as a most untidy process , rather than neatly going through a series of phases 53 . <p> These various models of policy-making , even occasionally the final one , are likely to be found relevant to different circumstances and parts of health systems . They will have different implications for the utilisation of research and although they do not stack up as connected paradigms , or have much predictive power , they help put shape onto otherwise inchoate patterns . We shall explore how far they specifically map on to models of research utilisation after considering the range of overlapping categorisations of health research . <h> Categories of health research and possible levels of utilisation <p> The categorisation of health research discussed here has a potential importance for the analysis of utilisation . Often a broad distinction is made between basic , clinical and applied research . By its nature basic , or blue-skies , research is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic , research has been undertaken and perhaps some synthesis with other findings has occurred . Research that follows priorities determined by the researchers themselves , according to the ' internalist ' norms of science 54 , is more often , though not always , going to be basic . Applied research is more likely than basic research to be following an agenda driven by forces other than the scientific imperative . Just because the research topic has been set by non-researchers does not , of course , ensure its impact . Nevertheless , where such drivers and sponsors are also the most likely potential users of the research , this provides some of the circumstances that might encourage utilisation 7 , 53 , 55 . <p> There is generally greater resistance within health services to the use of social science , despite it often being applied and user-driven , than there is to the adoption of the findings from natural sciences 7 , 10 such as those used in clinical science . Possible explanations include the fact that the more highly technical and specific the research , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly by policy makers without ideological or political considerations intervening too much . Moreover , the receptors of research are likely to place more confidence in the strictly controlled natural sciences than in the more eclectic social sciences . Much of policy-making can be seen as a craft , which draws substantially on ordinary knowledge and in which the contextual component will often be more significant than the type of evidence offered by social science research 56 . <p> Another partially overlapping distinction is between national and international research . International research findings might be more likely to be utilised where there is greater technical content in the research and also potential for application to an issue of patient care . The report of the Commission on Health Research for Development also identified the particular contributions that national and global health research could make 26 . It developed the concept of Essential National Health Research ( ENHR ) . This entails a strategy in which each country plans its health research according to country-specific health problems and the contribution it can make to regional and global health research . Mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more important in relation to international research . <p> Adding to the epistemological debate about the most appropriate forms of production of knowledge intended for utilisation , Trist 57 argued that domain-based research represented a third category alongside basic and applied research . Domain-based , or policy-oriented , research is essentially interdisciplinary and the crossing of new boundaries and the creation of new syntheses may advance both knowledge and human betterment . It also entails wider reference groups , beyond the scientific or clinical communities . Along similar lines , Gibbons et al 58 claim to identify a shift from the traditional discipline-centred mode of knowledge production that they characterise as Mode 1 , towards a broader conception of knowledge production described as Mode 2 . In this , knowledge is generated in a context of application and addresses problems identified through continual negotiation between actors from a variety of settings . The results are communicated to those who have participated in their production . Although the degree of change described by Gibbons et al could be exaggerated 59 , this general approach , as with that of Trist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research production on the interests of at least some potential users . <p> A slightly different dimension , but one also associated with utilisation , is that of the features of specific research studies . When a particular piece of research is seen to be of high quality this might help reinforce a policy-maker 's inclination to use it 14 , 60 , as might a favourable view about the quality of the specific researcher 10 . The argument , as developed by Weiss and Bucuvalas , is that where the policies are potentially controversial the decision-makers will not want the credibility of their case undermined by critics pointing to flaws in the research behind the policy 60 . When Ministers in the UK supported actions to address gender inequalities in the medical profession , they did so with full confidence in the quality of the research that demonstrated the problem 61 . Examinations of the use of economic evaluations and Health Technology Assessments ( HTAs ) in policy-making have considered the importance of the quality , reliability , timeliness and comprehensiveness of research in influencing the level of utilisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors were highlighted as important determinants of the usefulness of the information in the context of drug formulary decisions in the USA 68 . <p> Different types of research are likely to be most relevant for various levels and situations of policy-making , and for different aspects of those policies . There is no agreed typology of policy categories suitable for utilisation assessment 11 . Above , we suggest that the interpretation of policy being adopted here covers national policies , local health service policies and policies made by professional bodies . Along not dissimilar lines Black 34 argues that an earlier threefold categorisation 69 could be appropriate when examining health research and policy-making . The three categories are : governance policies which relate to organisational and financial structures ; service policies which cover resource allocation issues and pattern of services ; and practice policies which relate to the use of resources by practitioners in delivering patient care . A similar division appears in the threefold categorisation proposed by Lomas : ' legislative , administrative and clinical ' 70 . Legislative policies relate to the overall framework for organising health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocation of resources within the overall framework ; and clinical to the policies about what therapies are applied . These categorisations are best seen as a spectrum , but it is generally agreed that research has least impact on the first of these categories and most on the third where often the relevant knowledge comes from clinical research . This is despite the frequent delays in turning research evidence into improved patient care 71 , 72 . <p> Some of the issues in this section are illustrated in relation to Health Technology Assessments ( HTAs ) . Various features of HTAs might be associated with the sometimes quite high levels of translation into policy-making and through into the final outcomes 14 , 73 " 75 . Many HTAs are undertaken , commissioned , or produced by technology ' sponsors ' specifically for agencies set up to advise governmental bodies setting policies for delivering patient care in national health systems . Frequently they address a very specific question that has been identified and prioritised by the health care system : presumably , a question to which the system wants an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative outcomes if they can be supported by evidence . <p> Whilst these HTAs are ' technical ' in the sense that they typically relate to quantitative measures of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of specific interventions , they do have important distributional and equity implications . Policies deriving from them may induce strong public and patient reactions ( as is evident in media coverage of proposed guidance from bodies such as The National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK ) . This emphasises the need in such systems to differentiate between the research activity of health technology assessment and the decision-making ( or guidance forming ) process of appraisal of that evidence and its implications 76 . <p> But even for HTA the evidence of widespread , direct impact on policy ( with policy seen as entirely convergent with the research evidence ) is at best patchy . A study in the Netherlands by van den Heuvel et al 77 concludes that policy decisions concerning the introduction of ( new ) technologies in health care are not based on the results of medical technology assessments . Rather , ' political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent literature review , Barbieri and Drummond 78 found few examples of HTA impact in European health care systems . At the local level , those involved in making policies about the introduction of new medical technologies are likely to view the contribution that effectiveness research can make in different ways , depending on their professional backgrounds 79 . This discussion underlines the fact that even in the circumstances most favourable for ' rational ' policy-making there are limitations upon it . This indicates the need to consider the full range of models of research utilisation . <h> Models of research utilisation <p> Having reviewed various models of policy-making in the second section , and examined different types of research in the third section , it will now be useful to consider models of research utilisation in policy-making . Then we can see how far the various strands from these sections can be drawn together and developed in our later construction of a conceptual framework . We start by looking at previous models of research utilisation , and then suggest ways in which they could be elaborated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others 7 , 14 , 37 , 38 , 55 , 81 , 82 , various models of research utilisation in policy-making have been identified , and they are thought to be applicable beyond the social sciences : <h> The **31;266;TOOLONG model <p> This suggests a linear sequence in which research generates knowledge that impels action . <h> The **41;299;TOOLONG model <p> This also follows a linear sequence , but begins with the identification of a problem by a customer who requests the researcher to identify and assess alternative solutions . This was explicitly the model behind the changes attempted by the UK Department of Health in the 1970s 7 . <h> The interactive/social interaction model <p> The process here is a set of interactions between researchers and users rather than a linear move from research to decisions . It ensures they are exposed to each other 's worlds and needs . <h> The **35;342;TOOLONG model <p> According to this , research is more likely to be used through the gradual ' sedimentation ' of insight , theories , concepts and perspectives . This model has the advantage of extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be utilised . <h> The political model <p> In this , research findings become ammunition in an adversarial system of policy making . <h> The tactical model <p> Here research is used when there is pressure for action to be taken on an issue , and policy-makers respond by announcing that they have commissioned a research study on the matter . Whilst this can sometimes be seen as a cynical delaying tactic , there are other occasions on which the commissioning of research provides the political system with a valuable breathing space , thus reducing the chances of irrational policy-making . <p> There is no precise overlap between the principal characteristics of policy-making models discussed earlier and the utilisation processes listed above such as would allow them to be presented in neat pairs of singletons . The first two categories of utilisation both fit with rational models of policy-making , but it is the problem-solving model that shares the same starting point : identification of a problem by a policy-maker . The more incremental models of policy-making have the longer time frame implied by interactive and enlightenment models of utilisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts which are much more radical than is inherent in incrementalism . <p> Policy networks are seen as providing a useful framework for studying research utilisation 36 . Where researchers become part of a policy network , or find their ideas taken up by elements within it , this could be a strong version of the interactive model and be an important route for such findings to enter the policy arena . Network approaches can highlight the role of stakeholders in research utilisation 9 , 14 . ( The network concepts could also , however , help to explain the difficulties some research faces in gaining acceptance , or even a hearing . Policy-making systems can be relatively impermeable to research findings that are contrary to the consensus developed as a result of the strong , long-term , links between departmental officials and leaders of the main interest groups ) . <p> It is of value to explore the variety of **25;379;TOOLONG connections because they underline the argument that it is not realistic to expect policy-making always to follow the ends-means rational model that might entail the clearest use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms in which research might appear and be utilised in policy-making : as data and findings ; as ideas and criticism in the enlightenment mode ; or as briefs and arguments for action 83 . Along similar lines the utilisation of research in policy-making is sometimes considered to be instrumental , conceptual or symbolic 11 . As we have seen , instrumental use involves research findings being directly used in policy formulation , conceptual use refers to a type of enlightenment mode of utilisation , and symbolic to the use of the research to support a position already taken , which may be to continue with existing policies . <p> Taking another of Weiss 's arguments , that utilisation of research can be usefully be defined as a process of interaction between research inputs and decision outputs 43 , we next elaborate the range of possible uses of research . Given the diversity of forms of knowledge and policy decision , their interaction has to be understood in the context of both the diverse values shaped by philosophies of knowledge and the practical aspects of policy-making . With regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract and general models of reality . In terms of policy-making it is useful to distinguish three dimensions : the nature of decisions , that is , the extent to which they are explicit and specific versus implicit and diffuse ; the extent of choice available in a given situation ; and the political or technical character of actors participating in decisions . These are shown on Figure 2 and developed below but it is useful to consider the categories as a spectrum . <p> Sometimes policy-makers make rational and weighted decisions along a well charted course of action , yet more often apply knowledge through largely routine or unconscious processes in response to ad hoc situations ; here the context is implicit rather than explicit . A situation of choice will exist when several alternatives are perceived as viable , contrasting with a situation where a decision has been taken and the role for research is rather to support this choice . Support in turn covers two types of situation . Specific findings can be used to legitimate decisions when these have been formed , have hardened or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of models referred to above , support is more a matter of explicit policies being seen to be made by institutions that are research-based and therefore the policies gaining greater credibility . Political decisions are normally justified in terms of social values and understandings shaped in the political arena , but there can be a role for scientific inputs in the policy formulation . Technical decisions are those that are expected to be justified in terms of scientific or specialised methods . <p> The combination of diverse forms of scientific inputs and decision outputs shapes the processes of utilisation and creates specific expectations and opportunities . The components of Figure 2 are expounded in more detail as follows : <h> Conceptual modelling <p> Knowledge to inform complex situations is frequently demanded in the form of concepts to model or shape the general nature of the policy problems and possible solutions . Planning health sector reforms or identifying health policy in areas normally outside its purview , such as poverty or economic development , are likely to demand such knowledge , as they provide new disciplinary or social perspectives on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues 84 . They can be a first step to other forms of research utilisation . <h> Data-based policy <p> This form of utilisation aims to influence courses of action on the basis of the strength of empirical findings . Scientists may take the lead through a ' knowledge-driven ' approach , or policy-makers can demand such knowledge to solve specific problems ( ' policy-driven ' model ) . In either case scientific rigour , robustness and objectivity would be principles trusted by both researchers and policy-makers . <h> Constrained modelling <p> Constrained political conditions give rise to utilisation that , from the perspective of researchers , uses only a restricted range of available knowledge . Likewise , policy-makers will not commission or will discourage research that , in its broad outlines , poses more political risks than benefits 85 . <h> Strategic research <p> Policy is most often formulated in a context where lay ( as opposed to technocratic ) actors vie for power and resources . The choice of policy may be open , but only through politically controlled windows of opportunity . Under these circumstances the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often competing evidence . The aim of researchers is usually to influence policy choice or to make explicit the costs of not adopting a recommended course of action 86 . <h> Symbolic payback <p> Science has become a potent cultural symbol that permeates modern life and confers privileges on its users . Likewise , there is a political pay-off in supporting research and building research capacity in strategic areas . Research has become ' an essential mode of communication and persuasion in the public arena ' 43 . In complex organisations , research could be a common language used to talk across the boundaries of interests and content areas given its capacity to effectively link disparate realities and because of ' the patina of rigor that science confers to discourse ' . This might suggest that policies from bodies known to be research-informed might be more likely to be supported . <h> Symbolic argumentation <p> Policy making may be based mainly on reasons of interest , ideology or intellect . Under these circumstances , however , research can still be used as ammunition to support the decisions made and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arguments , rather than as data or evidence to be weighed . Arguments may be fashioned as by-products of formal research publications , particularly by policy analysis units , consulting firms and the media 87 . <h> Paradigms <p> Given the large measure of unconscious elements in every-day decision making , accepted ways of interpreting reality and facing problems are the most important influence . An aggregate of normative expectations may amount to an overriding view of what is desirable health policy , such as those advanced in Welfare State thinking . Such policy paradigms may be triggered off or supported by single or grouped assumptions derived from research , which also may achieve paradigmal status . Individual policies are likely to reflect the dominant paradigms of their time . <h> Policy-Makers ' practice wisdom <p> How far individual policy-makers will automatically attempt to use research findings on a regular basis will depend on multiple influences , such as training , continuous education , exposure to the media and to the demand of clients . <p> Although these categories are not water-tight , they help indicate the breadth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which any assessment methods should focus . <p> Various elements from this and preceding sections will be particularly useful as we develop our own conceptual framework for analysing and assessing research utilisation in the context of the increasing attention on HRSs . For example , the importance , but also the limitations , of the problem-solving model must be considered when examining the role of research priority setting . Furthermore , in light of the practical limitations on rational models , the importance of interactive perspectives will be highlighted as a way of encouraging policy-makers to be responsive to relevant research . Overall , both these points , and others , suggest that it is appropriate to focus on the actions that could be taken to encourage permeability at the interfaces between policy-makers and researchers . Such actions should help ensure both that researchers are aware of policy-makers ' needs , and that the policy-making system is willing and able to absorb relevant research findings . <p> It is also possible to link some of the ideas in this section to the three phases of policy-making referred to earlier : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For agenda setting the research could impact in one of several ways . Research could demonstrate the existence or extent of a problem , through either specific findings or a process of enlightenment . Alternatively , it could be that , as in the knowledge-driven model , the mere generation of the findings leads to pressure to act upon the new knowledge . The use of research in policy formulation could be in either the instrumental or conceptual/ enlightenment mode . A further possibility is that it could be used as briefs to inform arguments as set out in the political model of research use . The implementation of health policies is widely acknowledged often to be difficult 37 , 53 . At the implementation stage , research could play some part in demonstrating the best way to implement policy and could inform decisions . It could also be of symbolic use in helping to build support for implementation through assistance with communicating or justifying the policy and being used to generate support for it in terms of financial resources , political commitment , and public opinion . <p> Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment of utilisation , it will be useful to review the focus and methods adopted in previous studies of policy-making . This review will provide examples of where wide interpretations of utilisation have been incorporated into studies of the impact of research . <p> Studies of the nature and impacts of policy-making can each exploit a wide range of analytic methods . The area covered by them is extensive and here we review one study : that of policy change in relation to health financing reforms in South Africa and Zambia 31 . It illustrates several of the approaches that can be applied when analysing policy-making in general , and is included here as a backdrop to the accounts , immediately following this one , specifically on research utilisation in policy-making . The case study in each country was organised according to a conceptual framework consisting of a process of policy change moving from , Gilson et al state , ' agenda setting around a reform of focus , to reform design , and then through implementation to the achievement of immediate and longer term changes ' 31 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn upon so that the factors influencing each stage of the reform process were categorised and analysed according to four broad factors : context , actors , process and content . <p> In the two countries data were collected through : documentary analysis ; key informant interviews with policy-makers and analysts ; media analysis ; and review of secondary sources . The data analysis techniques included : development of a timeline for each reform ; stakeholder analysis ; policy mapping techniques ; impact analysis through use of secondary data ; and a review process . The two case studies incorporated examination of the impact on the policy development made by research analysts , both inside and outside government , and found it to be ' strongly dependent upon the presence of a policy champion ' 31 . <p> This section now draws selectively upon a review of a wide range of previous studies specifically about research utilisation in health policy . From this several key themes are discussed : <p> focus of the study ; <p> how far the study was based around a conceptual framework and how far comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in assessing impacts and outcomes ; <p> levels of utilisation and other benefits shown . <h> Focus of the study <p> Studies that start with the research project or programme , and examine the impact that it has had 14 , 17 , 75 , 89 , 90 , have the advantage of a reasonably tightly defined focus . They can be of use for research funders , but often run into the problem that any impact research makes is usually of a contributive nature and it is difficult to identify the impact of one project or programme from that of others with which the findings get mixed 16 . Other studies consider the portfolio of researchers ' work over a particular period 91 , or the contribution of specific health research centres 29 , 92 " 95 . Studies such as these lend themselves to network analysis . <p> Health policy-makers have been the focus of studies . Some examine the policy-makers ' use of research in general 96 . Others can involve health policy-makers , for example in mental health , being shown research papers describing evaluations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such research 60 . Drummond et al asked local policy-makers about their attitude to using economic evaluations in general , and whether they had used specific evaluations 65 . A major way in which impact on policy has been assessed is through studies that start with a policy area , or theme , and then seek to identify how far the policy-making or implementation has been informed by research 11 , 77 , 96 " 102 . Focusing on the policy area has the advantage of facilitating some assessment of how far lack of relevant research is the problem , as opposed to the underutilisation of existing research . <p> The two broad approaches , starting with research or starting with policy , have elements of overlap . A study of the role of research in the regulation of private health care providers in an Indian state focused on the activities of a key research centre 103 . In some studies of the impact of research on particular health care programmes , interviews with researchers produce examples of how their own research has been utilised 10 , 104 <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been organised by , or involved , international bodies including the Council on Health Research for Development ( COHRED ) 5 , the European Union ( EU ) 101 , and the Cochrane Collaboration 102 . Other studies explicitly take examples from two or more sub-national units 11 . Many studies cover a series of examples from the same country or sub-national unit . <h> Conceptual framework and comparisons <p> Some of the most illuminating studies are organised according to a conceptual framework . Thus Landry et al 91 attempted to operationalise Knott and Wildavsky 's Ladder of Knowledge Utilisation which suggests there are six stages of utilisation 105 . These are : transmission , cognition , reference , effort , influence , and application . Generally , studies that adopt a conceptual framework involve a series of cases . Buxton and Hanney 14 , 17 , 29 , 106 organised several series of studies around the conceptual framework described in Figure 1 . Walt 's framework for analysing health policy-making 88 , described earlier , was used to organise impact studies in Mexico 10 . The EU-funded set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conceptual framework , as described by Sauerborn et al 9 , that concentrates on analysis of the role of the various interests or stakeholders . <p> A key feature of all these studies is that the conceptual framework facilitates comparable analysis of the results . A considerable amount of this analysis is drawn upon elsewhere in this paper , but one example is given here . Lessons were learnt from the EU-funded studies regarding : factors enhancing or hindering research use ; possible indicators to measure research use ; and possible strategies to increase such use . However , it has become clear that making generalisations is difficult because of country specific factors such as differing contexts ( including the political system and culture ) , differing stakeholder constellations , and differing availability and quality of research . A conclusion , therefore , is that careful consideration of these factors , rather than recipe-like approaches , will be needed for successful enhancement of the use of research . ( A. Gerhardus-personal communication ) . Similarly , Berridge and Stanton 107 , after reviewing various case studies that were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of factors considered important in the research/policy relationship . They go on , however , to note that ' they are necessarily historically determined , and culture and context specific , rather than part of a reproducible general formula for action ' 107 . <h> Methods and standardised measures used in assessing impacts and outcomes <p> The two methods used most frequently , and usually used together , come from the qualitative tradition : documentary analysis and in-depth interviews 10 , 11 , 14 , 63 , 75 , 77 , 97 , 98 , 104 . The need for having the flexibility interviewing can provide is well illustrated by studies in which the original interview schedule had to be amended to take account of the different perspectives held by policy-makers of the role of research 79 . Interviewing is useful for understanding many aspects of research utilisation , including tracing networks between researchers and users 90 . <p> Some studies use insider knowledge 94 , 102 and there has been some adoption of questionnaires to researchers about the utilisation of their work 11 , 106 . Particularly where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used and administered either by phone 68 or by post 65 . In the latter case , Drummond et al also attempted to assess the problem of inaccurate responses . They included two fictitious studies in the list sent to policy-makers , and almost 20% claimed to have seen these studies ; some of those admitted to having been influenced by them 65 . Bibliometric analysis is sometimes incorporated into broader studies 106 and , in an analysis of the papers that were cited in clinical guidelines , Grant et al specifically adopted a bibliometric approach 109 . Historical approaches have also been adopted 99 , 107 and allow a more contextualised analysis . The methods used are diverse , and only partially depend on the focus and purpose of the studies . The list of studies described here partially overlaps with , but is not identical to , those 24 included in the recent systematic review 22 . The 24 include a greater proportion that use questionnaires administered either by phone or post , but still face-to-face interviews form the majority . <p> There have been a few recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four such studies are described below , starting with two where the focus of each case study was a specific piece of research . An assessment of the impact of HTAs in Quebec used a case study approach 75 . Initially seven levels of critical incidents were identified . The impact of each HTA was scored on the basis of documentary analysis , and the information completed and validated through contact with key witnesses . In this way , Jacob and McGregor explain , ' by taking into consideration the level and number of critical incidents , an overall estimate of impact on policy was awarded to each HTA . This was reported in a scale extending from 0 ( no impact ) to +++ ( major impact ) . The weight awarded to critical incidents was adjusted according the nature of the decision at issue ' 75 . <p> Despite the largely , though not exclusively , qualitative methods used by Buxton and Hanney , in one study they attempted to score the impact made by projects on the basis of material from questionnaires 106 . This was partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became available from case studies . The correlation was quite good at an overall level , though there were differences in both directions at the individual project level . This scoring was entirely a methodological exercise and the results for specific projects were not identified . <p> Lavis et al coded their interview material according to whether the research had been used at agenda setting and/or policy formulation stages , and whether the research had impacted on all the policy or only partially 11 . <p> The above three examples involved members of the assessment team undertaking the scoring and coding . The EU-funded project described by Gerhardus et al developed a model for mapping research to policy flows based on the qualitative case studies . From this model a set of numerical indicators was devised which entailed scoring by both the assessment team and stakeholders 101 . The intention , in what is probably the most methodologically ambitious research utilisation study included in this review , was that the indicators would be used in each of the eight countries to facilitate comparisons between research utilisation before and after interventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy was identified along with the content , conclusions and recommendations of the relevant research . Next , a series of questions was put to the stakeholders and points allocated according to their recall of the content etc . Further points were allocated depending on the references to the research made in speeches , statements , guidelines and similar sources . Finally , the stakeholders were asked to rate on a five-point scale a range of factors , including research , that influenced their decision making 101 . <p> Preliminary results from the study suggest that conceptually the set of indicators has proven to be helpful , but problems with computation of the indicators arose due to the generally small sample of stakeholders interviewed . There were also problems related to the data collection for applying the knowledge-related indicators . This part of the stakeholder interviewing frequently created a possibly stressful , or even embarrassing , exam-like situation and in some cases revealed problems due to the considerable recall period involved when probing about older pieces of research . The body of indicators developed in the project was quite large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simplified set of core indicators ( U. Sunderbrink " personal communication ) . <h> Level of utilisation and final outcomes <p> The examples suggest a greater level of utilisation and final outcomes in terms of health , health equity and social and economic gain than is often assumed , whilst still showing much underutilisation . There is considerable variation , both within and between studies . The study of the role of research in child health policy and programmes in Pakistan 104 found some examples of immediate clear-cut linkage between research and decisions , but in general the view was that research was little utilised . A mixed picture was reported in the Mexican studies : biomedical or clinical research was thought to be ' a critical resource for decision-making in each of the four programmes ' , but the importance of other types of research varied 10 . Of the eight policies examined in two Canadian provinces , four seemed to have been influenced by research , for example , in terms of agenda setting , research identified the need for increased pneumococcal immunisation in Saskatchewan 11 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insider-accounts , including that by Phoolcharoen 94 describing the role of the Health Systems Research Institute in Thailand in enabling research to impact on the reform of the health system . <p> Considerable utilisation is reported in some of the studies that focus on specific pieces of research . For two of these sets of studies , a wide interpretation of utilisation in policy-making was used 14 , 17 , 89 , 106 , and one focused explicitly on evaluative research 89 . In some , but not all , such cases there was purposive selection . The study of the HTAs in Quebec showed over 85% had had an impact on policy 75 . The latter study is also one of the comparatively few to trace through from impact on policy to actual outcomes or benefits . It was suggested there had been cost savings of between $16 and $27 million annually . The Buxton and Hanney studies also attempted to trace through to the outcomes although this proved difficult . In one case , the evidence suggested that the research had strongly influenced the policy on heart transplantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QALYs ( Quality-Adjusted Life Years ) that resulted from the programme being properly funded and organised , as opposed to the counterfactual which might have been a less substantial and piece-meal development of heart transplantation in the UK 110 . <p> While not specifically measuring levels of benefits , some of the studies have clearly shown an improvement in health equity as a result of policy changes : ' research has also played an important role in the expansion of Medicaid to poor pregnant women , young children , the elderly , and disabled ' 111 . Other studies have not only demonstrated a major impact on policy but also been able to describe how research led to a paradigm shift 95 . <p> The review of previous studies is now build upon in the following section as we develop our conceptual framework for assessing the level research utilisation in policy-making . <h> The interfaces between the health research system and policy-makers : priority setting and research commissioning <p> Increasing attention is focusing on the concept of interfaces between researchers and the users of research 6 , 7 , 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that there are likely to be different values and interests between the two communities 113 , with their different time-frames 6 , 7 , and that research is less likely to be utilised in a significant way unless networks and mechanisms are established at the interfaces . One version of the interfaces concept is presented in Figure 1 . The ' permeability of the interfaces ' 14 becomes important given the potential problems in the transmission of views and findings between researchers and policy-makers . Issues around interfaces need to be considered at various stages including priority setting , commissioning of research and communication of the findings . <p> The power relationship between publicly funded researchers and policy-makers may be described in terms of an exchange relationship 114 . The policy-maker receives new knowledge , and the testing of existing knowledge , in return for providing resources and public legitimacy . If the exchange becomes imbalanced , a reduction in the value of its outcomes becomes likely . Some of the analysis below attempts to identify both ways of enhancing the exchange , and the items upon which any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 1 , however , the picture is broader than this because many of the research findings flow into the pool of knowledge . Furthermore , some research that is potentially of use to policy-makers will not have been funded by them . This includes research from the international stock , which highlights the role of research as a global public good 3 . If a national system is to draw on this to maximum benefit , various interface mechanisms might be needed . This section , however , describes a mechanism specifically related to user-driven research , and the next section covers the broader interfaces . <p> It is not necessary here to describe all the expert approaches to research priority setting " see The 10/90 Report on Health Research , 2001 " 2002 4 for a recent review . Given all the current activities , however , it is important to consider problems identified in previous attempts to enhance utilisation through priority setting 7 . Resistance to priority setting comes from those who adopt the ' internalist ' view of research . They share Polanyi 's opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue the priorities that emerge from the scientific imperatives 115 . Most now accept the contention , as voiced by Kogan and Henkel , that if health research is ' internalist and freely sponsored , the problem for government will be that of securing adequate brokerage with it ... because it has not taken part in the setting of problems ' 7 . <p> In addition to the technical questions to do with how best to identify the most important priorities in terms of health needs , the utilisation aspects of the debate perhaps revolve around two key questions : <p> are priorities being set that will produce research that policy-makers and others will want to use ? <p> are priorities being set that will engage the interests and commitment of the research community ? <h> Research that Policy-makers will be more likely to use <p> Policy-makers have not always found it easy to identify their needs or to aggregate the demands from various sources 7 . Again , the limitations on the ends-means model of rationality must be recognised and it should not be assumed that sophisticated priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy-makers . This is why it is so important that the methods described do incorporate stakeholder involvement and an iterative approach 4 , and that , particularly when overseas agencies/researchers are involved , efforts are made to link the research to the priorities of the national policy-makers 21 . This should boost local ownership of the research . From the perspective of the policy-maker it is important that the research not only seems relevant , but also timely . Involvement in such priority setting is itself sometimes seen as a way of informing policy 7 . Any assessment of utilisation should include identification of policy-makers ' attitudes towards the priorities set . <p> The ability of policy-makers to set priorities , and the likelihood of them using the eventual research findings , will probably be increased if they are able to develop long-term links with researchers . This is especially the case for researchers in centres where they can build up their own shared reservoir of knowledge on the key issues and discuss this with policy-makers 14 , 29 , 103 . In these circumstances , researchers help develop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be addressed by research . Crucially , this allows researchers to play an interactive role in shaping policy-makers perceived needs . <h> Priorities to engage the commitment of researchers <p> There is a danger that the more the agenda is set unilaterally by non-researchers , the less the research community will be committed to working on it . At the commissioning interface between priority setting and the funding of specific pieces of research , there is some scope for subtle defection from the agreed priorities 116 . It is possible that the move towards Mode 2 research 58 means that an increasing number of researchers are moving away from belief in the superiority of the internalist Mode 1 approach . Where the policy-makers are working with the researchers as suggested by Trist 57 and Gibbons et al 58 this could result in research that has more chance of being utilised , but much of Gibbons et al 's analysis is not related to formal priority setting exercises . Iterative research commissioning processes 34 , 117 and priority setting 4 might be ways of addressing both problems identified in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting , there is no monopoly of wisdom and those who wield the enormous power of government do well to foster their own critics and counter-analysis 7 . Independent research can provide critical commentaries and alternative perspectives that are important for healthy policy-making in the long term . <h> The interfaces between the health research system and policy-makers : transfer of research to policy-makers <p> Much previous work stresses the importance of interactions between policy-makers and researchers in increasing the likelihood of attention being given to the knowledge produced . This continues the above discussion and fits especially well with Weiss 's interactive model 19 , and with the view that policy-makers are unlikely to take much notice of research if the first they know about it is when it arrives on their desk 89 . It is claimed that previous interaction increases the possibilities of the findings moving up the Ladder of Research Utilisation 105 , and that the building of bridges between researchers and policy-makers is important and could be achieved by ' decision-linked research ' 6 , 118 . <p> The studies described earlier provide many examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies ' 104 , and ' interactions ' 11 . A cholera researcher is quoted in the Mexican study as saying : ' " if there is n't a good relationship between a researcher and a decision-maker ... it is difficult for research results to be taken into account " ' 10 . Buxton 's insider account of his own work evaluating the emerging UK heart transplantation programme illustrates the benefits that can come from close liaison with the potential users 110 , 119 . As a result of frequent liaison the Department of Health knew the likely results of the final report . Then , on the day it was received , a major decision was made to fund a full heart transplantation programme in the UK , the benefits of which were described earlier . This demonstrates that although building interactive relationships is often a long-term endeavour , it can result in rapid policy-making . <p> Some of the studies provide examples of how good interaction was achieved through informal communications as a result of deliberate actions by researchers or even through chance relationships 10 . Researchers themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a useful but underdeveloped approach 53 . The existence of researchers , or research responsive members , in policy networks can also be important . These can be international 120 . These types of observations are broadly supported by some of the three most commonly mentioned facilitators of the use of research in the 24 studies included in the systematic review . The three are : personal contact between researchers and policy-makers ( 13/24 ) ; the timeliness and relevance of research ( 13/24 ) ; and the inclusion of a summary with clear recommendations ( 11/24 ) 22 . <p> The various actions of individuals can be important , but it is desirable to consider the role of the HRS in encouraging or facilitating interactions , networks and mechanisms at a system-wide level . Priority setting approaches are one such mechanism . The development of long-term research centres focusing on particular topics 10 , 14 , 29 is one of the potentially strongest ways a HRS can take action to increase the possibilities of research being used to inform policy . Here the concept , noted above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicitly been applied to assessments of the benefits from health research centres 29 . Furthermore , accounts from various countries or provinces describe the importance being attached to the creation of an institute for health research . Examples include : Mexico 6 ; Thailand 94 ; Canada 121 and Manitoba , Canada 93 . The desirability of such institutes engaging with stakeholders is being addressed by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research 122 . Once established , such links can build on mutual respect and help develop an understanding of the differing perspectives . <p> HRSs could also ensure long-standing committees or fora are formally established to allow scientists and policy-makers to discuss issues . These could operate at both interfaces " feeding into the priority setting , and ensuring key policy-makers are aware of relevant research . Such approaches have been used in various countries including the UK 7 and Burkina Faso 9 . Other brokerage mechanisms that could also be provided by the HRS include arranging seminars for policy-makers , and funding individuals to act as research brokers 7 , 80 , 123 , or translators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in key knowledge management roles within the HRS , take the findings from researchers and bring them to the attention of policy-makers and others . It is useful to think of diffusion of the findings at several levels . In addition to directing findings at policy-makers within the health system , efforts at wider diffusion might also help build support for adoption of the findings . <p> Whatever the direction of the dissemination , however , mechanisms are needed that review and synthesise research and attempt to identify the research that should be promoted from that that should not . HRSs have a clear responsibility in this area in terms of funding such reviews and their dissemination ; the latter through a range of mechanisms including the internet . It can go further than this , however , and the attempt to provide some structure , or ' knowledge warehouse ' 29 , to the pool or stock of knowledge should be seen as a key knowledge management function of the HRS . The international Cochrane Collaboration plays an important part in this , and was inspired by the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information system of the UK 's HRS 124 , 125 . The need to use and develop databases of evidence , and reviews of research , has been explored in relation to preparing evidence to inform policies on the reduction of health inequalities 126 . <p> Many , but not necessarily all , of the mechanisms for transmission of the relevant national and international research are the responsibility of the HRS to provide . Some of the above considerations are important in the interface between national health systems and international research and international bodies promoting health . In drawing conclusions from the COHRED studies , Chunharas comments : ' National research co-ordinating bodies , such as the ENHR mechanisms promoted by COHRED , can also play a mediating role to better foster research to policy linkages . International agencies too have an important contribution to make as intermediaries in linking knowledge and action ' 110 . The integration of research into the health care programmes of international organisations can be an effective mechanism for research-informed policies to be brought about 21 . <h> The role of policy-makers as receptors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of policy-makers in their role as recipients , or receptors , of research 7 , 9 , 11 , 104 , 112 , 127 , 128 . Despite the low response rate to their questionnaires , the findings from Landry et al 's study illustrate this point . They claim : ' factors such as dissemination and linkage mechanisms that are generally considered to be powerful explanatory factors and to be the most efficient targets for policy interventions are less important than factors such as the receptive capacity of users when one climbs from the stage of transmission to the higher stages in the ladder of knowledge utilisation . Future research must recognize that the same factors do not explain success at all stages of knowledge utilisation ' 91 . <p> Beyer and Trice 129 also set out a series of steps policy-makers go through when using research and this has been applied to health research 11 , 62 . Epistemological , social and institutional issues are all relevant to the role of the research receptor 7 , 128 . The types of research relevant to policy-making vary greatly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> is there research available that is either relevant to policy issues , or could help bring new issues onto the agenda ? <p> is such research being effectively brought to the attention of policy-makers in diverse positions within the health system ? <p> is the policy-making system capable of absorbing the research findings ? <p> are there situations where the policy-makers are willing , and able , to use it ? <p> The HRS can assist here in the various ways described , but the wider policy system has a responsibility to create the right institutional mechanisms and staff capacity . Broadly , the responsibility of the HRS is greatest in the first part of this spectrum . It is recognised that it is much more difficult to make recommendations about how to increase the use of research in the development and implementation of policy , than it is to suggest how to improve communications 10 . There is , however , no neat division of responsibility . The main thrust of our analysis is that the issues need to be addressed on a system-wide basis , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maximise the possibilities of research utilisation . These include encouraging policy-makers to see the benefits in general , and in specific situations , of using research to help build a policy environment which will result in improvements in the health system . <p> Institutional arrangements do matter 6 , 7 . A policy machine must face the problems involved in using research , some of which it will not have commissioned itself . It needs a capacity to decode the results of research or to discern a policy problem that might yield to disciplined enquiry . To some extent these needs might be met by the use of scientific or policy advisers from outside the policy-making body , but they may not have full access to the generative stage of policy development . Hence the need for internal brokerage . These might be officials with either a scientific or a professional or a policy-making background . The evidence is that , whatever their provenance , they may be able to assume the skills and value-set of boundary-crossers and research enablers 7 . Some have become famous for their ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers whilst enabling policy-makers to secure otherwise inaccessible skills and knowledge 130 . <p> The response of policy-makers to research varies not just with the type of issues and research being dealt with , but also with the differing attitudes they adopt towards the whole policy-making process 113 . As individuals , some policy-makers are much more receptive to research than others . The issues are wider than individual preferences , however , and also depend on : how far the research accords with the political and social zeitgeist of the time 128 ; the national political and administrative culture 10 ; and the institutional arrangements for policy-making . The historical study from Uruguay demonstrates the detrimental effect military dictatorship can have on research utilisation 99 . By contrast , the study from South Africa illustrates how , despite the problems , the new political environment can help foster the better use of research in the policies related to some programmes 98 . There will be clear opportunities for research findings to have greater impact when they are in tune with the wider developments of the time , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acted upon without sufficient analysis to test its validity . <p> There are variations in patterns of bureaucratic recruitment and other characteristics that can influence research utilisation . In the countries where the research and policy connections are strongest , the relationship has been enhanced by the fact that some of the senior administrators have had research experience or interests as part of their prior education 131 , 128 . This should make mutual institutionalisation of the relationship easier to secure . The willingness of officials to undertake policy analysis is seen as important 7 . In some systems specific policy analysis units 132 , or think tanks of researchers 9 , are established in health policy-making bodies . An important determinant of their success will be their position within the policy-making organisation . <p> Too often , however , officials in policy-making bodies are resistant to research because they display strong distrust of information generated outside the organisation or system 133 . Furthermore , the career patterns of policy-makers are often not compatible with strong research utilisation if the latter depends on developing long term relations to boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original sponsor of research is often not in place when the findings are reported . Patton , the arch proponent of making evaluations more likely to be used through being utilisation-focused , notes that the major problem with his approach is the frequent turn-over of the primary intended users 134 . Various studies support a greater emphasis on training of policy-makers , at least those in bureaucratic positions 9 , 10 . If such training fosters a more positive attitude towards the use of research findings , where relevant , in the policy-making system as a whole , this could mitigate some of the problems . <p> There will be situations , particularly where the policies are likely to be made at local level , where there is much less likelihood that the researchers will have the opportunity to develop an interactive relationship with potential policy-makers . Several consequences flow from this . As noted previously , the characteristics of specific pieces of research can become important determinants of its uptake . There is an onus on the HRS to ensure it identifies and publicises those characteristics of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should encourage such research to be undertaken . <p> In some countries there are specific mechanisms that lead to the incorporation into policy instruments of research such as Health Technology Assessments ( HTAs ) and clinical trials . This is one of the reasons noted previously for the greater likelihood of HTAs making an impact . A collaborative working group examining these issues in Europe concluded that , whilst they were able to identify occasional examples of systematic integration of HTA in decision-making structures , there was no direct link between the amount of money spent on HTA and its impact on the decision-making process 67 . Indeed , they suggest that small programmes can be involved in the core of the policy-making structure whilst larger HTA programmes have difficulty in demonstrating impact . <p> It seems clear that HTAs have had most impact in those situations where there are specific mechanisms in place that require research evidence to support well-defined policy decisions on provision , coverage or reimbursement ( and these impact on practice where there are further mechanisms to ensure local adherence to national policy ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration include : Germany , Spain , Switzerland , Sweden and , despite our earlier example , the Netherlands 67 . Conversely , HTA has had much less impact where these specific mechanisms are not in place and policy-makers are exposed to HTA only in a diffuse or indirect manner . <p> Governments that set up what could be considered rational policy-making arrangements in which primacy is given to the role of research evidence might find the results face considerable criticisms in the media . Even with a population fully engaged in the cost effectiveness/rationing debate , there would still be scope for disappointed interests to campaign against decisions . This illustrates the desirability of an integrated approach to utilisation and an awareness of all the pressures on policy-makers . <p> In the context of the above discussions more attention should be given to the role of incentives , both for researchers to produce utilisable research 6 and for policy-makers , at the system or individual level , to pay attention to it . In an exercise of empirically based modelling , Bardach 56 assumed classical economic rationality on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those for whom its utility exceeds the disutility of obtaining it and noted that co-operative relationships grow up with research consumers when producers try to reduce the cost to them of obtaining information . <p> Engaging in ' useful ' research produces some clear benefits for researchers . It may be a source of satisfaction that one 's work is being taken notice of and contributing to the formation of policy or the improvement of practice . At present , however , it is widely thought that the traditional academic criteria still dominate the crucial assessments of research performance upon which career advancement and peer recognition depend 7 , 29 , 98 , 135 , 136 . The assessment of utilisation , therefore , could become a key issue if rewards are to focus on relevance as well as research excellence 6 , 137 . <h> The interfaces and receptor model <p> Any assessment of the utilisation of health research in policy-making has to integrate two factors : an awareness of the wider influences on policy-makers and a detailed analysis of the specific ways the HRS could contribute to improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An appropriate model for assessing research utilisation in policy-making is also likely to be one that combines both an emphasis on the importance of actions at the interfaces and an analysis of the role of receptors . As we have seen there are many models already in existence . We are proposing an interfaces and receptor model because it allows a range of key issues to be integrated into the analysis . These include : <h> A focus on the need for multi-layered analysis <p> Multi-directional interactions with practitioners and the public are important for policy-makes and augment the crucial interface , for research utilisation in policy-making , between the HRS and the policy system . As noted above , this interface itself has various dimensions including : priority setting ; research commissioning ; and the transfer of research findings to policy-makers . <h> An appreciation that both researchers and policy-makers have their own values and interests <p> Therefore , for example , priority setting has to be sophisticated to maximise the likelihood that the research community will be engaged on a research agenda producing knowledge that the policy-makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large scale dissemination does not necessarily guarantee their research will be utilised 11 . Hence the importance of analysis that goes beyond examining dissemination and considers the nature of productive interactions and the characteristics of research to which receptors are responsive . <h> An emphasis on the role of the receptor <p> This is necessary because ultimately it is up to policy-makers to make the decisions ; this can be a convoluted process with many stages at which research could potentially have a role . Again as described above , there are various features of the organisation and training within the receptor ( or policy-making ) body that can enhance the utilisation of research . Even though responsibility lies with the receptors , the HRS should take every action possible to facilitate the use of the research . These are important considerations for any assessment of the success of the HRS in relation to utilisation . First , because they highlight the wider political context which is beyond the control of the HRS . Second , because they still leave room for assessments of the activities of the HRS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interfaces 14 and thus promote the uptake of the research findings by the receptors . <h> An approach that facilitates analysis of the key paradox highlighted by the systematic review <p> Innv+r et al concluded that , ' two-way personal communication , the most common suggestion , may improve the appropriate use of research evidence , but it might also promote selective ( inappropriate ) use of research evidence ' 22 . This potential problem can be addressed in several ways through the interfaces and receptor model . First , links between researchers and policy-makers should ideally develop on a long-term basis so that together at the priority setting interface they produce a research agenda that reflects some synthesis between the needs of policy-makers and the perspectives of independent research analysis . Second , the interfaces and receptor model emphasises the importance of the role of organisational and training issues such as the need for capacity to undertake systematic reviews and policy analysis within any system . While such capacity is seen as a way of enhancing the ability of the receptors to absorb research , it should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There could , therefore , be value in having assessments of utilisation that integrate the modelling of research utilisation with the epistemological , social and institutional analysis 7 inherent in concepts such as interfaces and receptor functions . This might contribute to future research policies and strategies in such a way as to promote greater utilisation . <h> Purposes of assessing the utilisation of research in health policy-making <p> Before showing how all the previous analysis could be built upon in the generation of appropriate tools for the assessment of the nature and extent of knowledge utilisation in health policy-making , it is desirable to consider the purposes of such assessments . The purpose of the assessment is likely to differ depending on the level at which it is conducted . <p> Buxton and Hanney 14 , 15 identified three main reasons for undertaking their case study , and more general , assessments of the benefits from research : <p> justifying spending resources on health research ; <p> assisting with the prioritisation of future expenditure ; <p> indicating ways to improve the conduct and management of research so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These considerations are particularly relevant when the assessment is related to the justification of , and accountability for , funding at a national level , even if the case studies are conducted at project or research unit level . For a body such as the WHO , there could well be an important role in conducting such assessments with the aim of providing evidence of the possibility of the effective use of research resources . This could support advocacy for greater resources to be made available for health research . Such advocacy has recently been powerfully made as part of the report from WHO 's Commission on Macroeconmics and Health 138 . This report is seen as convincing 139 , and thus perhaps is helping to generate a more promising climate in which research utilisation could be assessed . Cross-national studies of research utilisation around common themes might be the best way to conduct assessments that could illustrate effective ways in which health research can be used . Understanding could be gained from the comparisons between and within countries . The potential link with advocacy would be strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically in those areas where the Commission is calling for increased research funding . These areas include : reproductive health , maternal and child health , tropical diseases , and health systems research . <p> We noted previously the increasing WHO focus on the importance of research informing key policy areas 3 , 21 ; this perspective is shared by WHO regions , for example , in relation to policies for improving health equity 140 . In this context it is important to recognise the claim , made in section 8 , that assessment can influence the activities given priority by researchers . This is likely to be particularly relevant when the focus of the evaluation is the performance of specific research units , teams , or even individuals , especially when funding is at stake . Given this , it is argued that moves towards giving more importance to the assessment of utilisation of health research should help encourage researchers to devote effort to activities likely to stimulate impact , and reward those who are already doing so 7 , 29 , 136 . The greater the significance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over the methods to use . <p> In particular , the role of numerical indicators needs to be considered in relation to the purposes of the assessment . It is argued that if the indicators used in performance evaluation lack ' decision relevance ' they are ignored 141 . The introduction of performance indicators into a process such as research may , however , have a dysfunctional impact unless great care is taken to establish the purposes and likely consequences of assessments 13 , 18 . For example , an assessment system that resulted in more dissemination in general , as opposed to more targeted dissemination of relevant knowledge , would be repeating the dangers of increasing the overload on policy-makers 105 . Where indicators are involved , they can be used as either ' dials ' to measure inputs and outputs accurately , or as ' tin openers ' to identify issues needing further examination or to aid judgement 142 . Although the use of numerical indicators as dials has been advocated by some , in an area such as the assessment of research and its utilisation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution is usually recommended 13 , 18 , 142 . It would seem only sensible to use indicators as tin openers to aid judgements when the purpose of the assessment involves funding decisions . <p> Even when funding is not an issue , if any comparisons , especially international , are to be made , there would be dangers in using simple indicators outside of a wider qualitative assessment . They would become de-contextualised . The long-standing fears about such an assessment process include the danger of manipulation through collusion and the difficulty of making comparisons across programmes with a different composition of user groups 13 . Depending on the purpose of the assessment there is , nevertheless , scope for innovative thinking in terms of methods . <h> Methods for assessment of research utilisation in policy-making <p> Appropriate methods for assessment therefore have to be developed to reflect : <p> the purposes for which the assessment is to be conducted , for example , to increase accountability , or to support advocacy for health research ; <p> the analysis about the various types of research , the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the interfaces and receptors model ; and <p> the different roles that can be played by retrospective assessments and ones that focus on the current position . <p> Various lists have been produced of the type of information that could be gathered to produce numerical indicators to inform either self-evaluation/peer review of research teams 136 , or to inform regular monitoring of the benefits from work originating from a particular health research funder 12 , 18 . Items from these lists relevant for policy-making include a numerical record of : presentations to policy-makers ; production of fact sheets ; membership of advisory committees ; and membership of committees issuing a policy document or a treatment guideline . These are not really measures of actual impact and although one such measure , references in policy publications , was also proposed , the list would probably need to be supplemented ; in the case of regular monitoring , for example , by a set of structured case studies . When an evaluation within a country is to be used for making funding decisions , it would be unwise to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possible biases described above . Instead they should be used to inform judgements . <p> Nor would it be sensible to use such indicators in any cross-national comparative study unless they were informing wider qualitative studies . Furthermore , to understand the peculiar difficulties of using raw questionnaire data in relation to assessing research utilisation in policy-making on specific issues , it is helpful to return to the definition of policy-making given earlier . This emphasised that those who make policies are in a particular , authoritative , position . This presents a rather different set of circumstances from those encountered when assessing utilisation of specific findings by practitioners and members of the public . In such cases a sample might be thought to be representative of a wider group , and individual characteristics and circumstances might even out within the sample . Moreover , it could be claimed that the opinions of each practitioner or member of the public are equally valid as regards the influence of research upon their own behaviour . In a study of policy-making on a specific issue , by contrast , the interviewees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from relevant interest groups , commentators , and researchers as well as policy-makers with varying degrees of involvement in different aspects of the making of that policy . In relation to understanding the processes involved in the policy-making , therefore , the respondents might have conflicting views that do present truthful representations of what people saw and heard . Nevertheless , depending on the respondent 's degree of involvement with the specific events under consideration , these views are likely to be of varying validity in relation to providing an account of the key actions . <p> Such complexities no doubt help explain why qualitative interviewing and documentary analysis were used most frequently the research utilisation studies described in the review of previous work . Questionnaires could provide some information from a wider range of informants than it might be possible to interview . They could also be used to help identify aspects on which to focus detailed parts of the interviewing . In-depth interviews , however , are widely seen as the most appropriate method when there is a need to unravel situations with diverse layers and subtle nuances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys and questions might be useful for some limited purposes , that approach lacks the flexibility to tailor the line of discussion to the expertise of the individual , probe and explore issues in depth , and engage the informant in careful reflection ' 143 . The growth of health policy and systems research suggests there is an increasing number of researchers who could undertake such interviewing 122 . <p> Our review of previous studies demonstrated the great difficulties of making generalisations about specific factors associated with high levels of utilisation . To address this in any cross-national initiative it would be useful to adopt several strategies . First , as far as possible , structure all the assessment studies around a conceptual framework such as the interfaces and receptor framework presented earlier in the report . The framework is probably sufficiently broad to allow it to be applied to many situations . It would , nevertheless , help inform any interview schedule so as to ensure the questions were focusing on both how research findings were communicated across the interfaces , and the degree of policy-maker receptivity to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of items that it is expected would all have to be present if research utilisation is to be achieved . Rather , it would be so that the interview covered a range of items , some of which might emerge as the reasons linked to utilisation , or lack of it , in each particular study . <p> The second strategy would be to base the studies on common policy themes as far as possible . Possible specific topics within the areas identified in the previous section include multi-drug therapy for leprosy and equitable access to health services . For each of the common themes , a key body of international research would be identified and some of the analysis would relate to that , and some to the impact of the full body of research available to policy-makers in the specific country . Some of the potential purposes the WHO might have in conducting such a cross-national assessment were set out above . An approach that uses common elements in several detailed studies , but which also expects each study to produce its own narrative or story of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has similarities to broader approaches to the study of innovation and organisational change 144 . <p> Analysis of documents and semi-structured interviews would appear to be appropriate methods to use in a retrospective study of research impact on policy-making related to specific issues , especially where the policy is made at national or sub-national government level . Indeed , the recently conducted systematic review recommended that future research in this field , ' should combine interviews with document analysis ' 22 . Questionnaires could also have a role , particularly in securing a wide range of opinions about the current situation regarding knowledge sources for research utilisation in policy-making and the relevant HRS mechanisms . A combination of these approaches would provide triangulation of methods and data-sources . The account below focuses particularly on four main elements of the recommended methods for the retrospective part of the policy-making element of the Structured Cross-national Thematic Studies that could be undertaken in the WHO research utilisation project 24 : <p> documentary analysis ; <p> interviews ; <p> application of scales reporting the level of research utilisation in policy-making ; <p> overall analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each study . Initially it would be used in an attempt to identify the degree of consistency between the policy in the country and the body of international research that is being centrally collated by the WHO utilisation project team . Further documentary analysis would also cover issues such as how far policy-makers drew on research findings in speeches during the policy formulation and implementation stages , and accounts in reports from research funding bodies of their efforts at developing mechanisms to enhance research utilisation . The documentary data-sources would include : research publications and reports ; legislation ; administrative/executive regulations or orders ; reimbursement arrangements ; guidelines/advice ; meeting reports and minutes ( if available ) ; policy statements , speeches , and articles ; and reports from research funding bodies . A draft protocol for the first element of the documentary analysis has been prepared ( see additional file 1 : Elements of a protocol for documentary analysis ) . <h> Interviews <p> A stakeholder analysis could identify whom to interview first , and then snowball techniques , together with review of the questionnaires , would ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devising the semi-structured interview schedule to be used for all interviews , in all the countries participating in a cross-national study , it would be most important to allow interviewer flexibility . This would be necessary to deal with local circumstances and with situations , as described above 79 , where the interviewee has a much more limited conception of research informed policy than the interviewer . Despite these caveats it would also be desirable to develop a semi-structured interview schedule that covered as many as possible of the points discussed in the previous analysis . A draft semi-structured interview schedule has been developed ( see additional file 2 : Draft interview schedule for assessing research utilisation in policy-making ) , but it would have to be administered with considerable flexibility . <p> The interviews would allow : <p> comparability across themes and countries yet sensitivity to specific contexts ; <p> detailed investigation of the level of research impact , in relation to the particular issue , on the three stages of the policy-making process : agenda setting ; policy formulation ; and implementation ; <p> rolling triangulation ie using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> investigation of key HRS and other mechanism that operated at the interfaces to enhance the responsiveness of the receptors , including : priority setting and research commissioning mechanisms ; the creation of research centres and facilitating links with policy-makers ; encouraging and funding research **29;406;TOOLONG activities ; encouraging and funding reviews and syntheses of relevant research findings and the production of policy briefs ; and facilitating interaction between researchers and policy-makers at long-standing committees or one-off seminars etc ; <p> investigation of a wide range of other relevant issues : the role of key institutions and their mechanisms , such as policy analysis , for absorbing research and their exposure to forces in addition to research findings ; the responsiveness of policy-makers to different types and sources of research knowledge ; the features of specific research findings that made policy-makers more responsive to their findings ; the aspects of policy-making where research was seen as most valuable ; the role of networks , international bodies , practitioner and advocacy groups , NGOs , the media and the public in bringing research findings into the policy debate ; and developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wider assessment in the overall utilisation project about how far any research-informed policy formulation and implementation was contributing to an increase in any of the final outcomes such as health and health equity gains . <h> Application of scales describing the level of research utilisation in policy-making <p> Whilst there are reservations about the extent to which numerical indicators should be used for cross-national comparisons , it is possible to see how the type of exercises undertaken by Buxton and Hanney 106 , Jacob and McCregor 75 and Lavis et al 11 could be built upon . It might be possible to develop indicators in the form of descriptive scales of the degree of utilisation . These would be used to give an account of the impact of research on the policy-making in the specific context of each of the countries participating in the WHO research utilisation project . In the three studies cited above , the scoring or coding for each example was undertaken by the same team . Even clearer agreement about interpretation of scales would be necessary in an international exercise . Before starting any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be agreed between the assessment teams in the participating countries . <p> The previous analysis indicates that it would probably be appropriate to consider developing four scales to apply to research utilisation in each policy area . The first scale would focus on a slightly narrower range of research that , as noted above , would be the international research . This would examine the consistency between the research and the policy . Previous studies illustrate , however , that consistency with research findings does not necessarily demonstrate that the particular findings influenced the policy 14 . Where the policy consists of a clinical guideline developed by a professional group there could be circumstances in which the first scale on the degree of consistency , based on documentary analysis , might be the only scale appropriate to apply . In such circumstances the analysis should probably concentrate on the quality of the evidence used in the guidelines 145 . <p> The remaining three scales would each relate to assessing the actual role played by research in each of the three phases of policy-making described previously . The relationship between policy-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is inevitable that some research might play a part in only one of these three phases , but other research might play several roles . For example , epidemiological research might cause an issue to be placed on the policy agenda , other research that developed a specific way of improving treatment could be used in policy formulation , but might also have helped force the issue onto the policy agenda by showing improvements were possible . The details of each scale have been prepared ( see additional file 3 : Draft scales of the level of research utilisation in health policy-making ) . The key issues covered in them are described here : <h> ( i ) Consistency of policy with research findings <p> This scale would relate to how far the content of the policy on issue X was in agreement with the findings from a defined body of international research ( irrespective of the actual degree of influence of research on the policy formulation ) . It would initially be applied during the documentary analysis . <h> ( ii ) Degree of influence of research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent to which research ( including local research ) had been responsible for getting the issue onto the policy-makers ' agenda . It would cover research that : either showed the existence/extent of a problem ; or was so dramatic/decisive that it instigated action to be taken to turn it into policy ; or contained findings/theoretical frameworks that gradually changed the perception of policy-makers and others as to the importance of the issue in a process of enlightenment . It would rely on interviews , questionnaires and documentary analysis . <h> ( iii ) Degree of influence of research on policy formulation <p> This scale would relate to the actual influence the research had in the policy formulation process . It would aim not only to confirm any instrumental use of the research ( ie direct use of the findings or research theories in formulating the content of the policy ) but also to capture examples of the much wider range of possible impacts on policy , including the gradual sedimentation of insights , theories , concepts and perspectives in the enlightenment mode . This scale would consider the utilisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , and in policy discussions and debates . The scale would be based primarily on the data from the interviews , but also use survey and documentary data . <h> ( iv ) Degree of influence of research on policy implementation <p> The key issues for this scale would be the use of research in assisting implementation , either through findings which are used to inform decisions about how best to implement the policy , or by providing justification of the policy and being used to generate support for it in terms of financial resources , political commitment , and public opinion . The scale would be based on data primarily from interviews and documentary analysis . <h> Overall analysis <p> The interviews , questionnaires , and documentary analysis should also provide material to help identify the relative importance , in relation to the level of utilisation recorded , of each of the HRS mechanisms listed in the bullet point above . The types and sources of research used , and reasons for their use , should also be recorded and attempts made to correlate them with the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal validity of the judgements about the list and the scales by discussing the emerging findings with the respondents . The account of each study would also involve description both of the value given to research in the country and of the broader cultural and socio-political environment , to the extent that they seem relevant to the degree of research utilisation achieved . <p> The findings from the assessments in each participating country could be collated . For each research theme the analysis would compare two sets of data : the scales for level of utilisation in each country , and the contextualised lists of the HRS activities and other mechanisms and networks thought to be important . Organising the studies around common themes might assist assessment of how far the use of the international stock of knowledge was dependent on local research . <p> As noted previously , although the account here has focused on research impact on policy-making , the evaluations would be stronger as part of a wider analysis covering research utilisation and interactions with practitioners , industry and the public . The fuller analysis would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the environment in which the policy-making occurred . By building on the framework described in Figure 1 , it should provide a holistic approach 112 to these issues . Thus , the WHO research utilisation project was conceived as an integrated whole in which retrospective assessment of research utilisation in policy-making would examine one step in a process that should eventually lead to health and health equity gains 24 . <p> Given appropriate and targeted topic and country selection , this approach is likely to meet the purpose of using structured methods to provide examples of effective research utilisation . It should contribute towards enhanced understanding of the issues and could provide the basis of an assessment tool which , if used widely in countries , could give a boost to the importance attached to the utilisation of health research . <h> Conclusions <p> Increasing global attention is focusing on ways to improve health systems and the contribution that research-informed policies can make to this . It has long been recognised that a range of factors is involved in the interactions between health research and policy-makers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified additional mechanisms through which greater utilisation of research could be achieved . Assessment of the role of health research in policy-making is best undertaken as part of a wider study that also includes utilisation of health research by industry , medical practitioners , and the public . <p> The utilisation of health research in policy-making should eventually lead to desired outcomes , including health gains . Research can make a contribution in at least three phases of the policy-making process : agenda setting ; policy formulation ; and implementation . Descriptions of these processes , however , can over-estimate the degree of rationality in policy-making . Therefore , the analysis should be informed by a review of the full range of policy-making models . Various categories of research are likely to be used differently in health policy-making . Applied research might be more readily useable by a policy system than basic research , but health policy-makers tend to relate more willingly to natural sciences than social sciences . There also appears to be a greater chance of research being used in clinical policies about delivering care to patients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . <p> Models of research utilisation in policy-making start with a link to rational or instrumental views of policy-making , and include descriptions of how commissioned research can help to find solutions to problems . Other models relate to an incrementalist view in which policy-making involves a series of small steps over a long period ; research findings might gradually cause a shift in perceptions about an issue in a process of ' enlightenment ' . Interactive models of research utilisation stress the way in which policy-makers and researchers might develop links over a long period . Research can also be used symbolically to support decisions already taken . <p> Many previous studies of research utilisation can provide lessons for future assessments . Two broad approaches can be identified . Some studies start with pieces , or programmes , of research and examine their impact . Others consider policy on a particular topic and assess the role of research in the policy-making . To facilitate comparison , studies of research utilisation are best organised around a conceptual framework . Despite that , the influence of contextual factors in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used most frequently , and usually together , come from the qualitative tradition : documentary analysis and in-depth interviews . Questionnaires , bibliometric analysis , insider knowledge and historical approaches have all been applied . A few recent studies have attempted to score or scale the level of utilisation . The examples suggest there is a greater level of utilisation and final outcomes in terms of health , health equity , and social and economic gain than is often assumed , whilst still showing much underutilisation . There is considerable variation in the degree of utilisation , both within and between studies . <p> Increasing attention is focusing on the concept of interfaces between researchers and the users of research . This incorporates the idea that there are likely to be different values and interests between the two communities . At the prioritisation interface there are two key questions : whether priorities are being set that will produce research that policy-makers and others will want to use , and whether priorities are being set that will engage the interests and commitment of the research community . <p> Interactions across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to policy-makers . This fits especially well with the interactive model of utilisation . Actions by individual researchers can be useful in generating interaction , but it is desirable to consider the role of the HRS in encouraging or facilitating interactions , networks and mechanisms at a system-wide level . The HRS could provide funding and organisational support for various items including : long-term research centres ; research brokerage/translator mechanisms ; the creation of official committees of policy-makers and researchers ; and mechanisms for review and synthesis of research findings . <p> There is increased recognition of the significance of policy-makers in their role as the receptors of research . In relation to the perspective of policy-makers there is a spectrum of key questions . These range from whether relevant research is available and effectively being brought to their attention , to whether they are able to absorb it and willing to use it . The HRS has a responsibility , especially in the early parts of the spectrum , but the wider health system also has a responsibility to create appropriate institutional mechanisms and ensure there are staff willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given to the role of incentives . The assessment of utilisation becomes a key issue if rewards are to focus on relevance as well as research excellence . <p> An appropriate model for assessing research utilisation in policy-making combines analysis of two issues : the role of receptors and the importance of actions at the interfaces . An emphasis on the role of the receptor is necessary because ultimately it is up to the policy-maker to make the decisions . Any assessment of the success of the HRS in relation to utilisation must accept that the wider political context is beyond the control of the HRS , but consider the activities of the HRS , within its given context , to enhance the utilisation of research by increasing the permeability of the interfaces . <p> The reasons for assessing the utilisation of research in policy-making include : advocacy , accountability , and increased understanding . For the World Health Organization there could be a role in conducting such assessments with the aim of providing evidence of the effective use of research resources . This could support advocacy for greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important that the purposes of any assessment are taken into account in planning the methods to be used . <p> Previous studies demonstrated the difficulties of making generalisations about specific factors associated with high levels of utilisation . To address this in any cross-national WHO initiative involving a series of studies in a range of countries , it would be desirable to structure all the studies around a conceptual framework ( such as the interfaces and receptor framework considered here ) and base the studies in each country on common themes . These could include policies for the adoption of multi-drug therapy for treating leprosy , and for the equitable access to health services . <p> Analysis of documents and semi-structured interviews would be appropriate methods in each study assessing the role of research in policy-making on a specific policy theme . Surveys could also have a role . These approaches would provide triangulation of methods and data-sources and should also provide material to help identify the relative importance , in relation to the level of utilisation recorded , of the HRS mechanisms described in the previous analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their use , should also be recorded and attempts made to correlate them with the previous priority setting approaches .

U.S. adults also reported difficulty getting care in a timely fashion and using emergency departments for issues that a primary care physician could treat . Among the bright spots for the United States : having a care plan for chronic illness , and planning for end--of--life care . <h> The Issue <p> Across the developed world , national health systems must contend with caring for aging populations with high rates of disability and chronic disease .

In every country but France , one-fifth or more of older adults have experienced at least one of these problems . <p> Along with the U.K. , the U.S. did well in areas related to managing chronic illness : 58 percent of chronically ill older adults in the U.S. and 59 percent in the U.K. had discussed their treatment goals with their doctor and had clear instructions about when to seek further care .

@@13586013 @2186013/ <h> What 's behind delayed transfers of care ? <h> Briefing <h> Author <p> The NHS is under significant pressure this winter . The new year saw daily newspaper headlines on the winter crisis , while high rates of bed occupancy- and cuts to social care are both causing extra pressures to build up across the NHS . <p> Underlying all of this is the growing number of patients who are ready to leave hospital but ca n't do so without extra support . Delayed transfers of care ( DTOCs ) , often ( rather insultingly ) called bed-blocking ' by the media , have been steadily on the rise in recent years , with the numbers of days patients are delayed reaching record levels month after month . <p> DTOCs are a complex issue and to fixate on one solution would be to miss the point . Here , I explore what the data tells us about delays , and outline what can be done to address the problem . <h> What is a delayed transfer of care ? <p> NHS England defines patients as ready for transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that the patient is ready for transfer AND <p> b . A multidisciplinary team decision has been made that the patient is ready for transfer AND <p> c . The patient is safe to discharge/transfer . <p> DTOCs are officially recorded by NHS England in two ways : a snapshot of the actual number of patients delayed at midnight on the last Thursday- of every month , and the total number of bed days ( overnight stays ) during which patients were delayed . This data is collected monthly and available from 2010 . <h> How DTOCs have changed over time <p> Between 2011/12 and 2014/15 , the number of bed days used by patients who were delayed grew by 60 per cent . This means that by October 2016 , over 4,500 acute beds and 2,200 non-acute beds were occupied by these patients at any given time . That is the equivalent of more than ten 650-bed hospitals . <p> Although this is a relatively small proportion of the total number of beds available in NHS hospitals , the impact of these patients on the operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed , and many are staying for lengthy periods of time . This means that even very small fluctuations in these numbers can make a very big difference , resulting in a cycle of chaos which leads to ultimately sub-optimal care for patients . <p> The chart below shows how the number of delayed days across the NHS has grown since December 2010 , as well as the type of organisation responsible for the delay . <h> Why are we waiting ? The causes of DTOCs <p> As the data shows , the NHS had remained responsible for the majority of DTOCs over time , but the proportion for which social care are responsible has grown by 84 per cent since December 2010 . <p> The data also allows us to explore the reasons for delays . The most significant change since November 2010 has been an increase in the number of days delayed due to patients waiting for a care package to be available either at home ( 172 per cent increase ) or in a nursing home ( 110 per cent ) . <p> While the reduced availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DTOCs , 57 per cent of the delays occurred because of issues in the NHS . <h> DTOCs : the tip of the iceberg <p> DTOCs have a tight definition and as a result the reported figures often only represent a partial picture of the volume of patients that could be cared for in other settings . <p> We examined audit data from three members of our New Cavendish Group of small and medium-sized hospitals and a large database of snapshot audits undertaken by the Oak Group " a specialist company that conducts reviews of admissions and inpatient stays using a standard and validated approach . <p> The data showed a significant difference in the New Cavendish Group hospitals between the declared level of DTOCs and the number of patients actually medically fit for discharge . For example : <p> In one small rural hospital , an audit of inpatients excluding critical care and maternity found that , of 277 patients , 14 per cent ( 40 ) met the DTOC criteria but that in fact 29 per cent ( 80 ) of patients were medically fit for discharge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of patients who were not medically fit for discharge but could nevertheless have been looked after in other appropriate settings , such as a nursing home . <p> In another small rural hospital there were 45 medically fit patients , of whom only 15 were counted as DTOCs according to the strict interpretation of the guidance . <p> In a more extreme case in a larger hospital , 335 patients were reviewed out of 650 beds in total . Of these , 65 per cent ( 218 ) were found to be medically fit , of whom only- 6 per cent were going home that day . The snapshot of DTOCs that month declared only 56 for the month of the audit . <p> Other information and audits show a similar pattern . The Oak Group have undertaken audits across a large number of acute and community hospitals covering over 7,500 bed days . Again , these audits confirmed that significant numbers of patients could be cared for elsewhere , for typically 50-60 per cent of the acute bed days examined . The challenge is that just 19 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply return home without any form of support ; many others still require additional help , including high intensity nursing home care . A further 28 per cent could go home with a range of nursing and social care support , rehabilitation or clinical input , while 12 per cent require long-term supported live-in nursing or residential care . The remainder need rehabilitation , intermediate care and other specialist services . A small percentage need hospice or other palliative care . Many of these alternative services are provided by the NHS . <h> So what conclusions can we glean from this ? <p> As demonstrated above , many patients are prevented from leaving because they need more out-of-hospital support to help them recover . But the latest National Audit for Intermediate care estimates that there is just half the capacity of intermediate care required , with signs that bed-based components of these are in decline . <p> The audits also indicate a significant opportunity for improvements in internal processes within hospitals . In the Oak Group 's data , over half the delays are related to issues with the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues about planning , documentation and transport . <p> Indeed , the system itself can create delays . A complex array of factors are at play and poorly designed processes , high volumes of work , shaky administration and a lack of clear pathways can all exacerbate the problem . These range from simple issues , such as having the drugs ready for the patient to take home , to more complex ones , such as delays in getting diagnostic results or a lack of therapy services at weekends . I recently heard of one trust where a member of staff was employed solely for the purpose of dealing with the paperwork associated with the legal requirement trusts have to notify social services of a patient 's discharge date . <p> One important implication from looking at our case study hospitals is that once maternity , paediatrics , cancer and other beds that can not be used for emergencies are taken into account and the impact of patients waiting for discharge is allowed for , in one example a 650-bed hospital actually only had fewer than 250 beds available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely fragile . What looks like efficiency is actually the opposite . <p> Two important messages should also be taken from this . We need to beware a narrative that fixing social care will fix the problems of the NHS . It wo n't , but it would help . Secondly , it can not be assumed that alternatives to hospital will save large amounts of money unless far more radical changes to the system are made . <h> Solutions <p> Tackling the problem is not easy , but there are some clear learning points : <h> 1 . Define the real problem and measure it <p> Data that actually captures the real issue , rather than the current bureaucratic mechanisms for allocating blame , would be a good first step . As we have seen , the current system for reporting delayed discharges severely underestimates the numbers of patients in hospital who are ready to move elsewhere . Some hospitals have started to monitor the patients that could be cared for in other settings on a routine basis and are using this data to improve services . <h> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are known to reduce the numbers of patients waiting for discharge , ranging from simple process improvements to bigger policy changes such as discharge to assess ' . However , it is possible that hospitals are so busy fire fighting that they lack the capacity to implement these measures and they may lack adequate support from community services . <h> 3 . Improve the interface between hospitals and other services <p> The role of social care in creating delays is significant and growing , but the interface with community services- is a very significant factor , as is the availability of home support , therapies , access to diagnostics and other NHS services . <p> Housing associations , the voluntary sector and other agencies are useful allies , but they often find dealing with the NHS difficult and ca n't solve the health sector 's problems alone . <h> 4 . Moving away from bureaucracy <p> One case in the audit demonstrated that substantial managerial and nursing time was being spent managing relationships and administrative processes with social workers . But there is another way , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hospitals , with some local authorities recording virtually no social care DTOCs . <p> The large and growing numbers of patients delayed in leaving hospital are both a cause and a symptom of problems in the smooth running of NHS hospitals . Yet the official data seriously underestimates the extent of these delays . And , as my colleague Richard Humphries at The King 's Fund explains , there- is also huge variation in local government and NHS performance in managing these delays . Learning from areas with fewer delays , improving systems and processes within hospitals , and making better use of data can all help . But against a backdrop of continued public sector austerity and growing demand for hospital care , progress in reducing the numbers of patients delayed in leaving hospital may be slow .

Their four cases constitute decisions typical of the types physicians make on a regular basis : diagnostic testing , initial treatment and treatment monitoring .

Since then , CQC has completed inspections of all 136 acute non-specialist and all 18 specialist trusts , and now has a more detailed understanding of the quality of NHS care than ever before " at trust level , but also at an individual core service level . These comprehensive inspections have helped trusts to understand the specific areas where improvements are needed and to take targeted action and have provided increased transparency on performance for people who use services . <p> CQC 's analysis shows variation both in the quality of care between hospitals and between individual core services within the same hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and looking after patients well , inspections have also uncovered pockets of poor care even in good hospitals . <p> " We have now inspected every hospital in England and have a unique picture of the quality of care , right down to individual core services . We have witnessed some fantastic care and examples of innovative practice , but we have also found a wide variation in quality both between hospitals and between services within the same hospital . <p> " Safety remains a real concern , often due to a failure to learn when things go wrong . Strong leadership that instils a culture of learning and an environment where staff are listened to can play a vital part in bringing about improvements . But compassion is alive and well , with caring the most highly rated of the five key questions " overwhelmingly , we see staff behaving in a caring way , which is supported by what we hear from patients . The unwavering dedication and commitment of staff shines out from our inspection reports . <p> " What is clear is that while staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of acute care that once worked well can not continue to meet the needs of today 's population .

In this report , we have highlighted good practice so that others can learn from it , be inspired by it and adapt what is relevant to use in their own improvement journey . Moving away from an insular approach and actively sharing learning between organisations will be increasingly vital if the whole system is to move forward together .

It also shows the challenges that increased demand has created for managing patient flow throughout other hospital departments and wards , often compounded by delayed discharges which are linked to problems in the wider system , for example a lack of capacity within community health services or the social care system . <p> Despite the well-documented challenges that the NHS faces , CQC has found much good and outstanding care and has awarded ' outstanding ' ratings to five acute NHS trusts and five acute specialist NHS trusts . Also , 15 acute NHS trusts have exited special measures since July 2013 and have delivered innovative changes in order to do so . <p> The fact that a number of trusts have achieved major improvements , and in some cases moved from inadequate to good , is of great credit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . <p> While safety of hospitals continues to be a concern , with 11 per cent of NHS acute specialist trusts rated inadequate for safety , those trusts rated good for safety have an open and honest culture where all concerns are listened to and any issues identified are acted on and learnt from . <p> CQC 's analysis shows that good leadership is critical in ensuring that people receive safe effective and responsive care and in driving improvement . Where the leadership teams have viewed CQC 's findings as an opportunity to drive change they were more often able to make rapid improvements . In addition , strong leadership at ward and board level , a culture where staff are valued , along with collaboration with local healthcare partners have all been shown to be major factors in delivering sustainable high quality care . <p> Equally important to note is that caring is the most highly rated of the five key questions in acute hospitals .

In this sense , the essential knowledge described in the section on text types , structures and features develops in tandem with the processes students use to construct meaning(s) and what they are learning about the conventions of written and media language . <p> All of the existing content in the ELA program plays a key role in the development of literacy , whether or not it reappears in the program supplement . For example , given the amount of information on the conventions and development of spoken language that is already contained in the ELA program , including it in this document would have resulted in nothing more than repetition . In other words , it is anticipated that teachers will integrate the existing program content with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for teaching .

No one may be made to undergo care of any nature , whether for examination , specimen taking , removal of tissue , treatment or any other act , except with his consent . Except as otherwise provided by law , the consent is subject to no other formal requirement and may be withdrawn at any time , even verbally . <p> If the person concerned is incapable of giving or refusing his consent to care and has not drawn up advance medical directives under the Act respecting end-of-life care ( chapter S-32.0001 ) by which he expresses such consent or refusal , a person authorized by law or by a protection mandate may do so in his place . <p> 12 .

The alienation by a person of a part or product of his body shall be gratuitous ; it may not be repeated if it involves a risk to his health . <p> A person 's participation in research that could interfere with the integrity of his person may not give rise to any financial reward other than the payment of an indemnity as compensation for the loss and inconvenience suffered . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 25 ; 2013 , c. 17 , s. 5. @qwx178830 <p> CONFINEMENT IN AN INSTITUTION AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT <p> 1997 , c. 75 , s. 28 . <p> 26 .

Such consent may be given by the representative only if the person concerned does not object . <p> 27 . Where the court has serious reasons to believe that a person is a danger to himself or to others owing to his mental state , it may , on the application of a physician or an interested person and notwithstanding the absence of consent , order that he be confined temporarily in a health or social services institution for a psychiatric assessment . The court may also , where appropriate , authorize any other medical examination that is necessary in the circumstances .

Where the court orders that a person be placed under confinement for a psychiatric assessment , an examination must be carried out within 24 hours after the person is taken in charge by the institution or , if the person was already under preventive confinement , within 24 hours of the court order . <p> If the physician who carries out the examination concludes that confinement in an institution is necessary , a second psychiatric examination must be carried out by another physician , at the latest within 96 hours after the person is taken in charge by the institution or , if the person was already under preventive confinement , within 48 hours of the court order . <p> As soon as a physician reaches the conclusion that confinement is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians reach the conclusion that confinement is necessary , the person may be kept under confinement without his consent or the authorization of the court for no longer than 48 hours . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 28 ; 1997 , c. 75 , s. 31 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 3 . <p> 29 . A psychiatric examination report must deal in particular with the necessity of confining the person in an institution if he is a danger to himself or to others owing to his mental state , with the ability of the person who has undergone the examination to care for himself or to administer his property and , where applicable , with the advisability of instituting protective supervision of the person of full age . <p> The report must be filed with the court within seven days of the court order . It may not be disclosed , except to the parties , without the authorization of the court . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 29 ; 1997 , c. 75 , s. 32 . <p> 30 . Confinement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the court if both psychiatric reports conclude that confinement is necessary . <p> Even if that is the case , the court may not authorize confinement unless the court itself has serious reasons to believe that the person is dangerous and that the person 's confinement is necessary , whatever evidence may be otherwise presented to the court and even in the absence of any contrary medical opinion . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 30 ; 1997 , c. 75 , s. 33 ; 2002 , c. 19 , s. 1 . <p> 30.1 . A judgment authorizing confinement must also set the duration of confinement . <p> However , the person under confinement must be released as soon as confinement is no longer justified , even if the set period of confinement has not elapsed . <p> Any confinement required beyond the duration set by the judgment must be authorized by the court , in accordance with the provisions of article 30 . <p> 2002 , c. 19 , s. 1 . <p> 31 .

Every decision concerning a child shall be taken in light of the child 's interests and the respect of his rights . <p> Consideration is given , in addition to the moral , intellectual , emotional and physical needs of the child , to the child 's age , health , personality and family environment , and to the other aspects of his situation . <p> 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , s. 15 . <p> 34 .

The same rule applies to an application for rectification , if it is contested . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 40 . <p> 41 . Where the law does not provide the conditions for and manner of exercising the right of examination or rectification of a file , the court , upon application , determines them . <p> Similarly , if a difficulty arises in the exercise of those rights , the court settles it , upon application . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 41 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> CHAPTER IV <p> RESPECT OF THE BODY AFTER DEATH <p> 42 .

However , if the claims were not taken into account when the partition was made , they may , after discussion of the property of their debtor , pursue the other spouse . Each spouse then retains a remedy against the other for the amounts he or she would have been entitled to if the claims had been paid before the partition . <p> In no case may the spouse of the debtor spouse be called upon to pay a greater amount than the portion of the acquests he or she received from the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 59. @qwx178831 <p> SEPARATION AS TO PROPERTY <p> - 1 . - " - Conventional separation as to property <p> 485 .

Maternity is acknowledged by a declaration made by a woman that she is the mother of the child . <p> Paternity is acknowledged by a declaration made by a man that he is the father of the child . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 527 . <p> 528 . Mere acknowledgement of maternity or of paternity binds only the person who made it . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 528 . <p> 529 .

Proof of filiation may be made by any mode of proof .

Where the court is seized of an action concerning filiation , it may , on the application of an interested person , order the analysis of a sample of a bodily substance so that the genetic profile of a person involved in the action may be established . <p> However , where the purpose of the action is to establish filiation , the court may not issue such an order unless a commencement of proof of filiation has been established by the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from facts already clearly established by that person are sufficiently strong to warrant such an order . <p> The court determines conditions for the sample-taking and analysis that are as respectful as possible of the physical integrity of the person concerned or of the body of the deceased .

The contribution of genetic material to the parental project of another can not be the basis for any bond of filiation between the contributor and the child consequently born . <p> However , if the contribution of genetic material is provided by way of sexual intercourse , a bond of filiation may be established , in the year following the birth , between the contributor and the child . During that period , the spouse of the woman who gave birth to the child may not invoke possession of status consistent with the act of birth in order to oppose the application for establishment of the filiation . <p> 2002 , c. 6 , s. 30 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project involving assisted procreation between married or civil union spouses during the marriage or the civil union or within 300 days after its dissolution or annulment , the spouse of the woman who gave birth to the child is presumed to be the child 's other parent . <p> The presumption is rebutted if the child is born more than 300 days after the judgment ordering separation from bed and board of the married spouses , unless they have voluntarily resumed their community of life before the birth . <p> The presumption is also rebutted as regards the former spouse if the child is born within 300 days of the termination of the marriage or civil union , but after a subsequent marriage or civil union of the woman who gave birth to the child . <p> 2002 , c. 6 , s. 30 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 78 . <p> 539 .

However , the married or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child may contest the filiation and disavow the child if there was no mutual parental project or if it is established that the child was not born of the assisted procreation . <p> The rules governing actions relating to filiation by blood apply with the necessary modifications to any contestation of a filiation established pursuant to this chapter . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 539 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 30 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 539.1 .

A person who , after consenting to a parental project outside marriage or a civil union , fails to declare his or her bond of filiation with the child born of that project in the register of civil status is liable towards the child and the child 's mother . <p> 1991 , c. 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 541 .

A descendant of such a person may also exercise this right where the health of that descendant or of a close relative could be seriously harmed if the descendant were deprived of the information requested . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 542 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 30 ; 2006 , c. 22 , s. 177 . <p> CHAPTER II <p> ADOPTION <p> DIVISION I <p> CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTION <p> - 1 . - " - General provisions <p> 543 .

As regards the support owed to a child by his parents , the basic parental contribution , as determined pursuant to the rules for the determination of child support payments adopted under the Code of Civil Procedure ( chapter C-25.01 ) , is presumed to meet the needs of the child and to be in proportion to the means of the parents . <p> The basic parental contribution may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child which are specified in the rules , to the extent that such expenses are reasonable considering the needs and means of the parents and child . <p> 1996 , c. 68 , s. 1 ; I.N. 2016-01-01 ( NCCP ) . <p> 587.2 . The support to be provided by a parent for his child is equal to that parent 's share of the basic parental contribution , increased , where applicable , having regard to specified expenses relating to the child . <p> The court may , however , increase or reduce the level of support where warranted by the value of either parent 's assets or the extent of the resources available to the child , or to take account of either parent 's obligation to provide support to children not named in the application , if the court considers the obligation entails hardship for that parent . <p> The court may also increase or reduce the level of support if it is of the opinion that , in the special circumstances of the case , not doing so would entail undue hardship for either parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the costs involved in exercising visiting rights in relation to the child , an obligation to provide support to persons other than children or debts reasonably incurred to meet family needs . <p> 587.3 .

A debtor from whom arrears are claimed may plead a change , after judgment , in his condition or in that of his creditor and be released from payment of the whole or a part of them . <p> However , in no case where the arrears claimed have been due for over six months may the debtor be released from payment of them unless he shows that it was impossible for him to exercise his right to obtain a review of the judgment fixing the support . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 596 ; 2002 , c. 19 , s. 15 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 596.1 .

One ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> CHAPTER I <p> OPENING OF SUCCESSIONS <p> 613 . The succession of a person opens by his death , at the place of his last domicile . <p> The succession devolves according to the prescriptions of the law unless the deceased has , by testamentary provisions , provided otherwise for the devolution of his property . Gifts mortis causa are , in that respect , testamentary provisions . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 613 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 614 . In settling succession to property , the law considers neither the origin nor the nature of the property ; all the property constitutes a single patrimony . <p> 616 . Where persons die and it is impossible to determine which survived the other , they are deemed to have died at the same time if at least one of them is called to the succession of the other . <p> The succession of each then devolves to the persons who would have been called to take it in their place . <p> 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CHAPTER II <p> QUALITIES REQUIRED TO INHERIT <p> 1991 , c. 64 , c . II ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 617 . Natural persons who exist at the time the succession opens , including absentees presumed to be alive at that time and children conceived but yet unborn , if they are born alive and viable , may inherit . <p> In the case of a substitution or trust , persons who have the required qualities when the provision produces its effect in their regard may also inherit . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 617 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 618 . The State may receive by will . Legal persons may receive by will such property as they may legally hold . <p> A trustee may receive a legacy intended for the trust or a legacy to be used to accomplish the object of the trust . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 618 . <p> 619 .

The following persons are unworthy of inheriting by operation of law : <p> ( 1 ) - a person convicted of making an attempt on the life of the deceased ; <p> ( 2 ) - a person deprived of parental authority over his child , with the exemption for the child from the obligation to provide support , with respect to that child 's succession . <p> ( 1 ) - a person who has subjected the deceased to i 'll treatment or who has otherwise behaved towards him in a seriously reprehensible manner ; <p> ( 2 ) - a person who has concealed , altered or destroyed in bad faith the will of the deceased ; <p> ( 3 ) - a person who has hindered the testator in the drawing up , amendment or revocation of his will . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 621 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 88 . <p> 622 .

Any successor may , within one year after the opening of the succession or becoming aware of a cause of unworthiness , apply to the court to have an heir declared unworthy of inheriting if that heir is not unworthy by operation of law . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 623 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 624 . The married or civil union spouse in good faith of the deceased inherits if the marriage or civil union is declared null after the death . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 624 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 37 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> TITLE TWO <p> TRANSMISSION OF SUCCESSIONS <p> CHAPTER I <p> SEISIN <p> 625 . The heirs are seized , by the death of the deceased or by the event which gives effect to a legacy , of the patrimony of the deceased , subject to the provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions provided in this Book , the heirs are not liable for the obligations of the deceased in excess of the value of the property they take , and they retain their right to demand payment of their claims from the succession . <p> The heirs are seized of the rights of action of the deceased against the author of any infringement of his personality rights or against the author 's representatives . <p> 626 . A successor is entitled to have his heirship recognized at any time within 10 years from the opening of the succession to which he claims to be entitled or from the day his right arises . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 626 . <p> 627 . An apparent heir is obliged , by the recognition of the heirship of the successor , to restore everything he has received from the succession without right , in accordance with the rules in the Book on Obligations relating to restitution of prestations . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 627 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 628 . Any person who is unworthy of inheriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an apparent heir in bad faith . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 628 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 629 . Obligations of the deceased discharged by the apparent heirs otherwise than out of property from the succession are reimbursed by the true heirs . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 629. @qwx178829 <p> THE RIGHT OF OPTION <p> DIVISION I <p> DELIBERATION AND OPTION <p> 630 . Every successor has the right to accept or to renounce the succession . <p> The option is indivisible . However , a successor called to the succession in several ways has a separate option for each . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 630 . <p> 631 . No one may exercise his option with respect to a succession not yet opened or make any stipulation with respect to such a succession , even with the consent of the person whose succession it is . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 631 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 632 . A successor has six months from the day his right arises to deliberate and exercise his option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by as many days as necessary to afford him 60 days from closure of the inventory . <p> During the period for deliberation , no judgment may be rendered against the successor as an heir unless he has already accepted the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 632 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 633 . If a successor aware of his heirship does not renounce within the period for deliberation , he is presumed to have accepted unless the period has been extended by the court . If a successor is unaware of his heirship , he may be compelled to exercise his option within the time determined by the court . <p> If a successor does not exercise his option within the time determined by the court , he is presumed to have renounced . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 633 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 634 . If a successor renounces within the period for deliberation fixed in article 632 , the lawful expenses incurred to that time are borne by the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 634 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his option , his heirs deliberate and exercise the option within the period allotted to them to deliberate and exercise their option regarding the succession of their predecessor in title . <p> Each of the heirs of the successor exercises his option separately ; the share of an heir who renounces accrues to the coheirs . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 635 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 636 . A person may cause an option he has exercised to be annulled on the grounds and within the time prescribed for invoking nullity of contracts . <p> Acceptance is express where the successor formally assumes the title or quality of heir ; it is tacit where the successor performs an act that necessarily implies his intention of accepting . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 637 . <p> 638 . A succession devolving to a minor , to a protected person of full age or to an absentee is deemed to be accepted , except where it is renounced within the time for deliberation and exercise of the option , <p> ( 1 ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of full age under tutorship or curatorship or an absentee , by the representative of the successor with the authorization of the tutorship council ; <p> ( 2 ) - in the case of an emancipated minor or person of full age who requires assistance , by the successor himself , assisted by his tutor or his adviser . <p> In no case is the minor , the protected person of full age or the absentee liable for the payment of debts of the succession in excess of the value of the property he takes . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 638 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 639 . The fact that the successor exempts the liquidator from making an inventory , or mingles property of the succession with his personal property after the death , entails acceptance of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 639 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 640 . The succession is presumed to be accepted where the successor , knowing that the liquidator refuses or neglects to make the inventory , himself neglects to make the inventory or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an order to have him make the inventory within 60 days after expiry of the six months for deliberation . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 640 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 641 . The transfer by a person of his rights in a succession by gratuitous or onerous title entails acceptance . <p> The same rule applies to renunciation in favour of one or more coheirs , even by gratuitous title , and to renunciation by onerous title , even though it be in favour of all the coheirs without distinction . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 641 . <p> 642 . Mere conservatory acts and acts of supervision and provisional administration do not , by themselves , entail acceptance of the succession . <p> The same rule applies to an act rendered necessary by exceptional circumstances which the successor performs in the interest of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 642 . <p> 643 . The distribution of the clothing , personal papers , medals and diplomas of the deceased and family souvenirs does not by itself entail acceptance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the successors . <p> Acceptance by a successor of the transmission in his favour of a site intended for a body or ashes does not entail acceptance of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 643 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 644 . If a succession includes perishable property , the successor may , before the designation of a liquidator , sell it by agreement or , if he can not find a buyer in due time , give it to charitable institutions or distribute it among the successors , without implying acceptance on his part . <p> He may also alienate property which , although not perishable , is expensive to preserve or is likely to depreciate rapidly . In this case , he acts as an administrator of the property of others . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 644 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 89 . <p> 645 . Acceptance confirms the transmission which took place by operation of law at the time of death . <p> 648 . A successor may renounce the succession provided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no judgment having become final has been rendered against him as an heir . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 648 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 90 . <p> 649 . A successor who has renounced the succession retains his right to accept it for 10 years from the day that right arose , provided the succession has not been accepted by another . <p> Acceptance is made by notarial act en minute or by a judicial declaration which is recorded . <p> The heir takes the succession in its actual condition at that time and subject to the rights acquired by third persons in the property of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 649 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 650 . A successor who has been unaware of his heirship or has not made it known for 10 years from the day his right arose is deemed to have renounced the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 650 . <p> 651 . A successor who , in bad faith , has abstracted or concealed property of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is deemed to have renounced the succession notwithstanding any prior acceptance . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 651 . <p> 652 . The creditors of a successor who renounces may , if the renunciation is prejudicial to their rights , apply within one year to the court for a declaration that the renunciation may not be set up against them , and accept the succession in the place and stead of their debtor . <p> The acceptance has effect only in their favour , and only up to the amount of their claim . It has no effect in favour of the successor who renounced . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 652 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> TITLE THREE <p> LEGAL DEVOLUTION OF SUCCESSIONS <p> CHAPTER I <p> HEIRSHIP <p> 653 . Unless otherwise provided by testamentary provisions , a succession devolves to the surviving married or civil union spouse and relatives of the deceased , in the order and according to the rules provided in this Title . Where there is no heir , it falls to the State . <p> 656 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generations , each forming one degree . The series of degrees forms the direct line or the collateral line . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 656 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 657 . The direct line is the series of degrees between persons descended one from another . The number of degrees in the direct line is equal to the number of generations between the successor and the deceased . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 657 . <p> 658 . The direct line of descent connects a person with his descendants ; the direct line of ascent connects him with his ancestors . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 658 . <p> 659 . The collateral line is the series of degrees between persons descended not one from another but from a common ancestor . <p> In the collateral line , the number of degrees is equal to the number of generations between the successor and the common ancestor and between the common ancestor and the deceased . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 659. @qwx178829 <p> REPRESENTATION <p> 660 . Representation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to a succession which his ascendant , who is a closer relative of the deceased , would have taken but is unable to take himself , having died previously or at the same time , or being unworthy . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 660 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 661 . There is no limit to representation in the direct line of descent . <p> Representation is allowed whether the children of the deceased compete with the descendants of a represented child , or whether , all the children of the deceased being themselves deceased or unworthy , their descendants are in equal or unequal degrees of relationship to each other . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 661 . <p> 662 . Representation does not take place in favour of ascendants , the nearer ascendant in each line excluding the more distant . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 662 . <p> 663 . In the collateral line , representation takes place , between privileged collaterals , in favour of the descendants in the first degree of the brothers and sisters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between ordinary collaterals , in favour of the other descendants of the brothers and sisters of the deceased in other degrees , whether they are in equal or unequal degrees of relationship to each other . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 663 . <p> 664 . No person who has renounced a succession may be represented , but a person whose succession has been renounced may be represented . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 664 . <p> 665 . In all cases where representation is permitted , partition is effected by roots . <p> If one root has several branches , the subdivision is also made by roots in each branch , and the members of the same branch share among themselves by heads . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 665 . <p> CHAPTER IV <p> ORDER OF DEVOLUTION OF SUCCESSIONS <p> DIVISION I <p> DEVOLUTION TO THE SURVIVING SPOUSE AND TO DESCENDANTS <p> 666 . If the deceased leaves a spouse and descendants , the succession devolves to them . <p> The spouse takes one-third of the succession and the descendants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. 666 . <p> 667 . Where there is no spouse , the entire succession devolves to the descendants . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 667 . <p> 668 . If the descendants who inherit are all in the same degree and called in their own right , they share in equal portions and by heads . <p> If there is representation , they share by roots . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 668 . <p> 669 . Unless there is representation , the descendant in the closest degree takes the share of the descendants , to the exclusion of all the others . <p> 672 . Where there are no descendants , two-thirds of the succession devolves to the surviving spouse and one-third to the privileged ascendants . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 672 . <p> 673 . Where there are no descendants and no privileged ascendants , two-thirds of the succession devolves to the surviving spouse and one-third to the privileged collaterals . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 673 . <p> 674 . Where there are no descendants and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged ascendants and the privileged collaterals . <p> Where there are no privileged ascendants , the privileged collaterals inherit the entire succession , and vice versa . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 674 . <p> 675 . Where the privileged ascendants inherit , they share equally ; where only one of the privileged ascendants inherits , he takes the share that would have devolved to the other . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 675 . <p> 676 . Where the privileged collaterals who inherit are fully related by blood to the deceased , they share equally or by roots , as the case may be . <p> Where this is not the case , the share which devolves to them is divided equally between the paternal line and the maternal line of the deceased ; persons fully related by blood partake in both lines and those half related by blood partake each in his own line . <p> If the privileged collaterals are in one line only , they inherit the entire succession to the exclusion of all other ascendants and ordinary collaterals in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx178831 <p> DEVOLUTION TO ORDINARY ASCENDANTS AND COLLATERALS <p> 677 . The ordinary ascendants and collaterals are not called to the succession unless the deceased left no spouse , no descendants and no privileged ascendants or collaterals . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 677 . <p> 678 . If the ordinary collaterals include descendants of the privileged collaterals , these descendants take one-half of the succession and the other half devolves to the ascendants and the other collaterals . <p> Where there are no descendants of privileged collaterals , the entire succession devolves to the ascendants and the other collaterals , and vice versa . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 678 . <p> 679 . The succession devolving to the ordinary ascendants and the other ordinary collaterals of the deceased is divided equally between the paternal and maternal lines . <p> In each line , the persons who inherit share by heads . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 679 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 91 . <p> 680 . In each line , the ascendant in the second degree takes the share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ordinary ascendants or collaterals . <p> Where in one line there is no ascendant in the second degree , the share allotted to that line devolves to the closest ordinary collaterals descended from that ascendant . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 680 . <p> 681 . Where in one line there are no ordinary collaterals descended from the ascendants in the second degree , the share allotted to that line devolves to the ascendants in the third degree or , if there are none , to the closest ordinary collaterals descended from them , and so on until no relatives within the degrees of succession remain . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 681 . <p> 682 . If there are no relatives within the degrees of succession in one line , the relatives in the other line inherit the entire succession . <p> 684 . Every creditor of support may within six months after the death claim a financial contribution from the succession as support . <p> The right exists even where the creditor is an heir or a legatee by particular title or where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the death , but does not exist in favour of a person unworthy of inheriting from the deceased . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 684 . <p> 685 . The contribution is made in the form of a lump sum payable all at once or by instalments . <p> The contribution made to the creditors of support , with the exception of that made to the former spouse of the deceased who was in fact receiving support at the time of the death , is fixed with the concurrence of the liquidator of the succession acting with the consent of the heirs and legatees by particular title or , failing agreement , by the court . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 685 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 92 . <p> 686 . In fixing the contribution , the needs and means of the creditor of support , his circumstances and the time he needs to acquire sufficient autonomy or , if he was in fact receiving support from the deceased at the time of the death , the amount of the instalments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support or of the lump sum awarded as support are taken into account . <p> Account is also taken of the assets of the succession , the benefits derived from the succession by the creditor of support , the needs and means of the heirs and legatees by particular title and , where that is the case , the right to support which may be claimed by other persons . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 686 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 687 . Where the contribution is claimed by the spouse or a descendant , the value of the liberalities made by the deceased by act inter vivos during the three years preceding the death and those having the death as a term are considered to be part of the succession for the fixing of the contribution . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 687 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 93 . <p> 688 . The contribution granted to the spouse or to a descendant may not exceed the difference between one-half of the share he could have claimed had the entire succession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , and what he receives from the succession . <p> The contribution granted to the former spouse is equal to the value of 12 months ' support , and that granted to other creditors of support is equal to the value of six months ' support ; however , in neither case may such a contribution , even where the creditor was in fact receiving support from the deceased at the time the succession opened , exceed the lesser of the value of 12 or six months ' support and 10% of the value of the succession including , where that is the case , the value of the liberalities . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 688 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 689 . Where the assets of the succession are insufficient to make full payment of the contributions due to the spouse or to a descendant , as a result of liberalities made by acts inter vivos during the three years preceding the death or having the death as a term , the court may order the liberalities reduced . <p> Liberalities to which the spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those he has received shall be imputed to his claim . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 689 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 94 . <p> 690 . Any alienation , security or charge granted by the deceased for a prestation clearly of smaller value than that of the property at the time it was made is presumed to be a liberality . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 690 . <p> 691 . Benefits under a retirement plan contemplated in article 415 or under a contract of insurance of persons , where these benefits would have been part of the succession or would have been paid to the creditor had it not been for the designation of a subrogated holder or a beneficiary , by the deceased , during the three years preceding the death , are considered to be liberalities . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary , rights conferred by benefits under any such plan or contract may be transferred or seized for the payment of support due under this chapter . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education or maintenance and customary presents are not considered to be liberalities unless , considering the means of the deceased , they are manifestly exaggerated . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 692 . <p> 693 . Reduction of the liberalities takes place against one of the beneficiaries or several of them simultaneously . <p> If need be , the court fixes the share payable by each beneficiary sued or impleaded . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 693 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 694 . Payment of the reduction is made , failing agreement between the parties , on the conditions determined by the court and on the terms and conditions of guarantee and payment it fixes . <p> Payment in kind may not be ordered , but the debtor may be discharged at any time by handing over the property . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 694 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 695 . Property is valued according to its condition at the time of the liberality and its value at the opening of the succession ; if property has been alienated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of reinvestment , the value of the replacement property on the day the succession opened is the value considered . <p> Liberalities by way of a usufruct , right of use , annuity or income from a trust are taken into account at their capital value on the day the succession opened . <p> Any testamentary provision which would defeat this right without otherwise providing for the devolution of the property is without effect . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 696 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 697 . The State is not an heir , but is nonetheless seized of the property bequeathed , as is an heir , once all known successors have renounced the succession , or , where no successor is known or claims the succession , six months after the death . <p> It is not liable for obligations of the deceased in excess of the value of the property it takes . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 697 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 698 . Seisin of a succession which falls to the State is exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a succession may be mingled with the property of the State so long as it remains under the administration of the Minister of Revenue . <p> 700 . At the end of the liquidation , the Minister of Revenue renders an account to the Minister of Finance . <p> The Minister of Revenue gives and publishes a notice of the end of the liquidation in the same manner as for a notice of seisin of the State . He indicates in the notice the residue of the succession and the time granted to successors to assert their rights of heirship . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 700 ; 2005 , c. 44 , s. 54 . <p> 701 . The Minister of Revenue , upon rendering account , transfers to the Minister of Finance the amounts constituting the residue of the succession , which then become the property of the State . <p> Heirs who establish their quality may , however , within 10 years from the opening of the succession or from the day their right arises , recover those amounts from the Minister of Revenue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were transferred to the Minister of Finance , at the rate set under the second paragraph of section 28 of the Tax Administration Act ( chapter A-6.002 ) . <p> 702 . An heir who claims the succession before the end of the liquidation takes it in its actual condition , subject to his right to claim damages if the legal formalities have not been observed . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 702 ; 1997 , c. 80 , s. 48 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> TITLE FOUR <p> WILLS <p> CHAPTER I <p> THE NATURE OF WILLS <p> 703 . Every person having the required capacity may , by will , provide otherwise than as by law for the devolution upon his death of the whole or part of his property . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 703 . <p> 704 . A will is a unilateral and revocable juridical act drawn up in one of the forms provided for by law , by which the testator disposes by liberality of all or part of his property , to take effect only after his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointly by two or more persons . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 704 . <p> 705 . The act is a will even if it contains only provisions regarding the liquidation of the succession , the revocation of previous testamentary provisions or the exclusion of an heir . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 705 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 706 . No person may , even in a marriage or civil union contract , except within the limits provided in article 1841 , renounce his or her right to make a will , to dispose of his or her property in contemplation of death or to revoke the testamentary provisions he or she has made . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 706 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 40 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> CHAPTER II <p> THE CAPACITY REQUIRED TO MAKE A WILL <p> 707 . The capacity of the testator is considered relatively to the time he made his will . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 707 . <p> 708 . A minor may not dispose of any part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 708 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 95 . <p> 709 . A will made by a person of full age after he has been placed under tutorship may be confirmed by the court if the nature of its provisions and the circumstances in which it was drawn up allow it . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 709 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 710 . A person of full age under curatorship may not make a will . A person of full age provided with an adviser may make a will without assistance . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 710 . <p> 711 . A tutor , curator or adviser may not make a will on behalf of the person whom he represents or assists , either alone or jointly with that person . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 711. @qwx178829 <p> FORMS OF WILLS <p> DIVISION I <p> GENERAL PROVISIONS <p> 712 . The only forms of will that may be made are the notarial will , the holograph will and the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c. 64 , a. 712 . <p> 713 . The formalities governing the various kinds of wills shall be observed , on pain of nullity . <p> However , if a will made in one form does not meet the requirements of that form of will , it is valid as a will made in another form if it meets the requirements for validity of that other form . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 713 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 714 . A holograph will or a will made in the presence of witnesses that does not fully meet the requirements of that form is valid nevertheless if it meets the essential requirements thereof and if it unquestionably and unequivocally contains the last wishes of the deceased . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 714 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 715 . No one may cause the validity of his will to be subject to any formality not required by law . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 715 ; I.N. 2015-11-01. @qwx178830 <p> NOTARIAL WILLS <p> 716 . A notarial will is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of a witness or , in certain cases , two witnesses . <p> The date and place of the making of the will shall be noted on the will . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 716 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 717 . A notarial will is read by the notary to the testator alone or , if the testator chooses , in the presence of a witness . Once the reading is done , the testator shall declare in the presence of the witness that the act read contains the expression of his last wishes . <p> The will is then signed by the testator , the witness or witnesses and the notary , in each other 's presence . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 717 ; 1992 , c. 57 , s. 716 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 718 .

The notarial will of a testator who can not sign contains a declaration by him to that effect . This declaration also is read by the notary to the testator in the presence of two witnesses , and it compensates for the absence of the signature of the testator . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 719 . <p> 720 . The notarial will of a blind person is read by the notary to the testator in the presence of two witnesses . <p> In the will , the notary declares that he has read the will in the presence of the witnesses , and this declaration also is read . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 720 . <p> 721 . The notarial will of a deaf person is read by the testator himself in the presence of the notary alone or , if he chooses , of the notary and a witness . If the testator is able to do so , he reads the will aloud . <p> In the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of the notary and , where such is the case , the witness . If the testator is unable to speak , the declaration is read to him by the notary in the presence of the witness ; if he is able to speak , it is read aloud by the testator himself , in the presence of the notary and the witness . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 721 ; 2013 , c. 27 , s. 24 . <p> 722 . A person unable to express himself aloud who wishes to make a notarial will conveys his wishes to the notary in writing . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 722 . <p> 722.1 . A deaf person who , being unable to speak , read or write , can not avail himself of the other provisions of this section may make a notarial will , provided he conveys his wishes to the notary through a sign-language interpreter . <p> The testator , in the presence of the notary and a witness , declares , through the same means , that the document translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interpreter is chosen by the testator from among interpreters qualified to exercise their functions before the courts and may in no case be the spouse of the testator or related to the testator in either the direct or the collateral line up to and including the third degree , or be connected to that extent by marriage or a civil union to the testator . <p> The interpreter must first swear in writing , before the notary , the testator and the witness , to carry out his functions with impartiality and accuracy and not to disclose any information related to his mandate . The original of the oath is attached to the will . <p> 2013 , c. 27 , s. 25 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 96 . <p> 723 .

Where the will is written by a third person or by technical means , the testator and the witnesses initial or sign each page of the act which does not bear their signature . <p> The absence of initials or a signature on each page does not prevent a will made before a notary that is not valid as a notarial will from being valid as a will made in the presence of witnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A person who is unable to read may make a will in the presence of witnesses , provided the will is read to the testator by one of the witnesses in the presence of the other . <p> The testator , in the presence of the same witnesses , declares that the document read is his will and signs it at the end or causes a third person to sign it for him in his presence and according to his instructions . <p> The witnesses sign the will forthwith in the presence of the testator . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 729 ; 2013 , c. 27 , s. 26 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 730 .

Where possible , the testator affixes his signature or a personal mark at the end of the will . Otherwise , the testator has a third person sign for him , in his presence and in accordance with his instructions . The witnesses then sign the will immediately in the presence of the testator . <p> The interpreter is chosen by the testator from among interpreters qualified to exercise their functions before the courts and may in no case be the spouse of the testator or be related to the testator in either the direct or the collateral line up to and including the third degree , or be connected to that extent by marriage or a civil union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in writing , before the drafter , the testator and the witnesses , to carry out his functions with impartiality and accuracy and not to disclose any information related to his mandate . The original of the oath is attached to the will . <p> 2013 , c. 27 , s. 27 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 101 . <p> CHAPTER IV <p> TESTAMENTARY PROVISIONS AND LEGATEES <p> I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> DIVISION I <p> VARIOUS KINDS OF LEGACIES <p> 731 . Legacies are of three kinds : universal , by general title and by particular title . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 731 . <p> 732 . A universal legacy entitles one or several persons to take the entire succession . <p> ( 2 ) - a dismemberment of the right of ownership of the whole or of an aliquot share of the succession ; <p> ( 3 ) - the ownership or a dismemberment of the right of ownership of the whole or of an aliquot share of all the immovable or movable property , private property , community property or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , c. 64 , a. 733 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 734 . Any legacy which is neither a universal legacy nor a legacy by general title is a legacy by particular title . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 734 . <p> 735 . The exception of particular items of property , whatever their number or value , does not affect the character of a universal legacy or of a legacy by general title . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 735 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 736 . Property left by the testator for which he made no provision or for which the provisions are without effect remains in his intestate succession and devolves according to the rules governing legal devolution of successions . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 736 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 737 . Testamentary provisions made in the form of an appointment of heir , a gift or a legacy , or in other terms indicating the intentions of the testator , take effect according to the rules provided in this Book with regard to universal legacies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sufficient expression by the testator of a different intention takes precedence over the rules referred to in the first paragraph and the meaning ascribed to certain terms . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 737 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01. @qwx178830 <p> LEGATEES <p> 738 . A universal legatee or legatee by general title is an heir upon the opening of the succession , provided he accepts the legacy . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 738 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 739 . A legatee by particular title who accepts the legacy is not an heir , but is nonetheless seized of the property bequeathed , as is an heir , by the death of the deceased or by the event which gives effect to the legacy . <p> He is not liable for the debts of the deceased on the property of the legacy unless the other property of the succession is insufficient to pay the debts , in which case he is liable only up to the value of the property he takes . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 739 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to receive his legacy , a legatee by particular title is required to have the same qualities as are required to inherit . <p> He may be unworthy to receive the legacy just as a person may be unworthy to inherit ; like a successor , he may apply to the court to have an heir or a colegatee by particular title declared unworthy . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 740 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 741 . Like a successor , a legatee by particular title has the right to deliberate and exercise his option with respect to the legacy made to him , with the same effects and according to the same rules . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 741 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 742 . The provisions concerning the petition of inheritance and its effects on the transmission of the succession are also applicable , adapted as required , to a legatee by particular title . <p> In all other respects , the legatee by particular title is subject to the provisions of this Book concerning legatees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.N. 2014-05-01. @qwx178831 <p> THE EFFECT OF LEGACIES <p> 743 . Fruits and revenues from the property bequeathed accrue to the legatee from the opening of the succession or the time when the provision takes effect in his favour . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 743 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 744 . Bequeathed property is delivered , with its accessories , in the condition in which it was when the testator died . <p> This rule also applies to the rights attached to bequeathed securities , if they have not yet been exercised . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 744 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 102 . <p> 745 . Where immovable property is bequeathed , any accessory or annexed immovable property acquired by the testator after signing the will is presumed to be included in the legacy , provided the property forms a whole with the immovable bequeathed . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 745 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 103 . <p> 746 . The legacy of an enterprise is presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the will which , at the time of death , form an economic unit with the bequeathed enterprise . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 746 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 747 . Where the payment of a legacy is subject to a term , the legatee nevertheless has an acquired right from the death of the testator which is transmissible to his own heirs or legatees by particular title . <p> The right of the legatee to a legacy made under a condition is also transmissible unless the condition is of a purely personal nature . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 747 . <p> 748 . A legacy to a creditor is not presumed to have been made as compensation for his claim . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 748 . <p> 749 . Where , in testate successions , the legacy is made to all the descendants or collaterals of the testator who would have been called to his succession had he died intestate , representation takes place in the same manner and in favour of the same persons as in intestate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly or by the effect of the provisions of the will . <p> There is no representation in the matter of legacies by particular title , however , unless the testator has so provided . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 749 ; I.N. 2014-05-01. @qwx178832 <p> LAPSE AND NULLITY OF LEGACIES <p> 750 . A legacy lapses when the legatee does not survive the testator , except where there may be representation . <p> A legacy also lapses where the legatee refuses it , is unworthy to receive it or dies before the fulfilment of the suspensive condition attached to it , if the condition is of a purely personal nature . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 750 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 751 . A legacy also lapses if the bequeathed property perished totally during the lifetime of the testator or before the opening of a legacy made under a suspensive condition . <p> If the loss of the property occurs at the death of the testator , at the opening of the legacy or subsequently , the insurance indemnity is substituted for the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 751 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 752 . Where a legacy charged with another legacy lapses from a cause depending on the legatee , the legacy imposed as a charge also lapses , unless the heir or legatee called to take what was the object of the lapsed legacy is able to execute the charge . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 752 . <p> 753 . A legacy made to the liquidator as remuneration lapses if he does not accept the office . <p> This is also the case where a legacy is made to remunerate the person appointed by the testator as tutor to a minor child or designated by him to act as the administrator of the property of others . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 753 . <p> 754 . A remunerative legacy is resolved where the liquidator , tutor or another administrator of the property of others designated by the testator ceases to hold that office ; he has in this case a right to remuneration proportionate to the value of the legacy and the time for which he held the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 104 . <p> 755 . Accretion takes place in favour of the legatees by particular title where property is bequeathed to them jointly and a lapse occurs with regard to one of them . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 755 . <p> 756 . A legacy by particular title is presumed to be made jointly if it is made by one and the same provision and if the testator has not allotted the share of each colegatee in the bequeathed property or has allotted the colegatees equal aliquot shares . <p> It is also presumed to be made jointly when the entire property is bequeathed by the same act to several persons separately . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 756 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 757 . A condition that is impossible or that is contrary to public order is deemed unwritten . <p> Thus , a clause limiting the rights of a surviving spouse in the event of a remarriage or new civil union is deemed unwritten . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 757 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , c. 6 , s. 41 . <p> 758 . A penal clause intended to prevent an heir or a legatee by particular title from contesting the validity of the will or any part of it is deemed unwritten . <p> A disinheritance taking the form of a penal clause intended for the same purpose is also deemed unwritten . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 758 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 759 . A legacy made to the notary who executes a will or to the spouse of the notary or to a relative in the first degree of the notary is without effect ; this does not affect the other provisions of the will . <p> 761 . A legacy made to the owner , a director or an employee of a health or social services establishment who is neither the spouse nor a close relative of the testator is without effect if it was made while the testator was receiving care or services at the establishment . <p> A legacy made to a member of a foster family while the testator was residing with that family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a. 761 ; 2002 , c. 19 , s. 15 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 762 . A legacy of property of another is without effect , unless it appears that the intention of the testator was to oblige the heir to obtain the bequeathed property for the legatee by particular title . <p> 764 . A legacy made to the spouse before a divorce or the dissolution of a civil union is revoked unless the testator manifested , by means of testamentary provisions , the intention of benefitting the spouse despite that possibility . <p> Revocation of the legacy entails revocation of the designation of the spouse as liquidator of the succession . <p> The same rules apply if the marriage or civil union is declared null during the lifetime of the spouses . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 764 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 42 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 765 . Express revocation is made by a subsequent will explicitly declaring the change of intention . <p> A revocation that does not specifically refer to the revoked act is nonetheless express . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 766 . A will that revokes another will may be made in a different form from that of the revoked will . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 766 . <p> 767 . The destruction , tearing or erasure of a holograph will or of a will made in the presence of witnesses entails revocation if it is established that this was done deliberately by the testator or on his instructions . Similarly , the erasure of any provision of a will entails revocation of the legacy made by that provision . <p> Revocation is entailed also where the testator was aware of the destruction or loss of the will and could have replaced it . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 767 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 768 . A subsequent testamentary provision similarly entails tacit revocation of a previous provision to the extent that they are inconsistent . <p> The revocation retains its full effect even if the subsequent provision lapses . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 768 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 769 . Alienation of bequeathed property , even when forced or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entails revocation with regard to everything that has been alienated , unless the testator provided otherwise . <p> Revocation subsists even if the alienated property has returned into the patrimony of the testator , unless a contrary intention is proved . <p> If the forced alienation of the bequeathed property is annulled , it does not entail revocation . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 769 . <p> 770 . Revocation of a previous express or tacit revocation does not revive the original provision , unless the testator manifested a contrary intention or unless such intention is apparent from the circumstances . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 770 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 771 . If , owing to circumstances unforeseeable at the time of the acceptance of the legacy , the execution of a charge becomes impossible or too burdensome for the heir or the legatee by particular title , the court , after hearing the interested persons , may revoke it or change it , taking account of the value of the legacy , the intention of the testator and the circumstances . <p> 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> PROOF AND PROBATE OF WILLS <p> 772 . A holograph will or a will made in the presence of witnesses is probated , on the application of any interested person , in the manner prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure ( chapter C-25.01 ) . <p> The known heirs and successors shall be summoned to the probate of the will unless an exemption is granted by the court . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 772 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2016-01-01 ( NCCP ) . <p> 773 . No person having acknowledged a will may thereafter contest its validity , although he may apply to have the will probated . <p> In the case of contestation of a will which has been probated , the burden is on the person availing himself of the will to prove its origin and regularity . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 773 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 774 . A will that is not produced may not be probated ; it must be reconstituted upon an action in which the heirs , the other successors and the legatees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its contents , origin and regularity must be conclusive and unequivocal . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 774 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 775 . Proof by testimony of a will that can not be produced is admissible if the will has been lost or destroyed , or is in the possession of a third person , without the collusion of the person who wishes to avail himself of the will . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 775 . <p> TITLE FIVE <p> LIQUIDATION OF SUCCESSIONS <p> CHAPTER I <p> OBJECT OF LIQUIDATION AND SEPARATION OF PATRIMONIES <p> 776 . The liquidation of an intestate or testate succession consists in identifying and calling in the successors , determining the content of the succession , recovering the claims , paying the debts of the succession , whether these be debts of the deceased , charges on the succession or debts of support , paying the legacies by particular title , rendering an account and delivering the property . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 776 . <p> 777 . The liquidator exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time necessary for liquidation , the seisin of the heirs and the legatees by particular title . <p> The liquidator may even claim the property against the heirs and the legatees by particular title . <p> The designation or replacement of the liquidator of the succession is published in the register of personal and movable real rights and , where applicable , in the land register . Registration of the act of designation or replacement is obtained by presenting a notice which refers to the act of designation or replacement , identifies the deceased and the liquidator and contains the description of the immovables concerned , if any . <p> 778 . The testator may modify the seisin , powers and obligations of the liquidator and provide in any other manner for the liquidation of his succession or the execution of his will . However , a clause that would in effect restrict the powers or obligations of the liquidator in such a manner as to prevent an act necessary for liquidation or to exempt him from making an inventory is deemed unwritten . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 779 . Where the succession is manifestly solvent , the heirs may , by mutual agreement , liquidate it without following the prescribed rules for liquidation . As a result of this decision , they are liable for payment of the debts of the succession from their own patrimony , even where the debts exceed the value of the property they take . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 779 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 780 . The patrimony of the deceased is separate from that of the heir by operation of law until the succession has been liquidated . <p> The separation has effect with regard to both the creditors of the succession and the creditors of the heir or of the legatee by particular title . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 780 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 781 . The property of the succession is used to pay the creditors of the succession and to pay the legatees by particular title , in preference to any creditor of the heir . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 781 . <p> 782 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts of the succession only in the case where the heir is liable for debts of greater value than the property he takes and the property of the succession is insufficient . <p> In that case , payment of the creditor of the succession is made only after payment of the creditor of each heir whose claim arose before the opening of the succession . However , a creditor of the heir whose claim arose after the opening of the succession is paid concurrently with the unpaid creditors of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 782 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> CHAPTER II <p> LIQUIDATOR OF THE SUCCESSION <p> DIVISION I <p> DESIGNATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LIQUIDATOR <p> 783 . Any person fully capable of exercising his civil rights may hold the office of liquidator . <p> A legal person authorized by law to administer the property of others may hold the office of liquidator . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 783 . <p> 784 . No one is bound to accept the office of liquidator of a succession unless he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 784 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 785 . The office of liquidator devolves by operation of law to the heirs unless otherwise provided by a testamentary provision ; the majority of the heirs may designate the liquidator and provide the mode of his replacement . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 785 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 106 . <p> 786 . A testator may designate one or several liquidators ; he may also provide the mode of their replacement . <p> A person designated by a testator to liquidate the succession or execute his will has the quality of liquidator whether he was designated as administrator of the succession , testamentary executor or otherwise . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 786 . <p> 787 . Persons holding the office of liquidator together shall act in concert , unless exempted therefrom by the will or , in the absence of a testamentary provision , by the heirs . <p> If one of the liquidators is prevented from acting , the others may perform alone acts of a conservatory nature and acts requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 788 . The court may , on the application of an interested person , designate or replace a liquidator failing agreement among the heirs or if it is impossible to appoint or replace the liquidator . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 788 . <p> 789 . The liquidator is entitled to the reimbursement of the expenses incurred in fulfilling his office . <p> He is entitled to remuneration if he is not an heir ; if he is an heir , he may be remunerated if the will so provides or the heirs so agree . <p> If the remuneration was not fixed by the testator , it is fixed by the heirs or , in case of disagreement among the interested persons , by the court . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 789 . <p> 790 .

Any interested person may apply to the court for the replacement of a liquidator who is unable to assume the responsibilities of his office , who neglects his duties or who does not fulfil his obligations . <p> During the proceedings , the liquidator continues to hold office unless the court decides to designate a provisional liquidator . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 791 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 792 . Where the liquidator is not designated , delays to accept or decline the office or is to be replaced , any interested person may apply to the court to have seals affixed , an inventory made , a provisional liquidator appointed or any other order rendered which is necessary to preserve his rights .

The liquidator is bound to make an inventory , in the manner prescribed in the Title on Administration of the Property of Others . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 794 . <p> 795 . Closure of the inventory is published in the register of personal and movable real rights by registration of a notice identifying the deceased and indicating the place where the inventory may be consulted by interested persons . <p> The notice is also published in a newspaper circulated in the locality where the deceased had his last known address . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 795 . <p> 796 . The liquidator informs the heirs , the successors who have not yet exercised their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditors of the registration of the notice of closure and of the place where the inventory may be consulted , and transmits a copy of the inventory to them if that can easily be done . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 796 . <p> 797 . The creditors of the succession , the heirs , the successors and the legatees by particular title may contest the inventory or any item in it ; they may also agree to a revision of the inventory or request a new inventory . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 797 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 798 . Where an inventory has already been made by an heir or another interested person , the liquidator shall verify it . He shall also ascertain that the notice of closure has been registered and that everyone who should have been informed has been informed . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 798 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 799 .

The testator may change the manner and proportion in which the law holds his heirs and legatees by particular title liable for payment of the debts and imposes reduction of the legacies on them . <p> The changes may not be set up against the creditors ; they have effect only between the heirs and the legatees by particular title . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 833 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 834 .

Indivision may also be maintained in respect of the family residence or of movable property serving for the use of the household , even where a right of ownership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil union spouse . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 840 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 44 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 841 . An heir who before the death actively participated in the operation of the enterprise or lived in the family residence may apply to the court for the maintenance of the indivision . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 841 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 842 . When deciding an application for the maintenance of indivision , the court takes into account the testamentary provisions , as well as the interests involved and the means of livelihood which the family and the heirs derive from the undivided property ; in all cases , the agreements among the partners or shareholders to which the deceased was a party are respected . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 842 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 114 . <p> 843 . On the application of an heir , the court may , to avoid a loss , stay the immediate partition of the whole or part of the property and maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64 , a. 843 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 844 . Maintenance of indivision takes place upon the conditions fixed by the court but may not be granted for a duration of more than five years except with the agreement of all the interested persons . <p> It may be renewed until the death of the married or civil union spouse or until the majority of the youngest child of the deceased . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 844 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 45 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 845 . The court may order partition where the causes that justified the maintenance of indivision have ceased or where indivision has become intolerable or presents great risks for the heirs . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 845 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 115 . <p> 846 . If an application for the maintenance of indivision contemplates a particular item of property or a group of properties , nothing prevents proceeding with the partition of the residue of the property of the succession . Furthermore , the heirs may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indivision by paying his share themselves or granting him , after evaluation , other property of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 846 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 847 . A person entitled only to enjoyment of a share of the undivided property may only participate in a provisional partition . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 847 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 116 . <p> 848 . Every heir may exclude from the partition a person who is not an heir but to whom another heir transferred his right in the succession , by paying him the value of the right as at the time of the withdrawal and his disbursements for costs related to the transfer . <p> Partition of an immovable is deemed to have been carried out even if parts remain which are common and indivisible or which are intended to remain undivided . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 849 . <p> 850 . If the undivided shares are equal , as many shares are composed as there are heirs or partitioning roots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares are composed as necessary to allow a drawing of lots . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 850 . <p> 851 . In composing the shares , account shall be taken of the testamentary provisions , particularly those charging certain heirs with payment of debts or legacies , as well as the rights of action the heirs have against each other for the amounts they paid in excess of their shares ; account shall also be taken of the rights of the surviving married or civil union spouse , the applications for allotment by preference , the objections and , where such is the case , the reserve funds for satisfying potential judgments . <p> Consideration may also be given to , among other things , the fiscal consequences of the allotments , the intention shown by certain heirs to assume certain debts or the convenience of the mode of allotment . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 851 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 46 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 852 . In composing the shares , immovables should not be parcelled and enterprises should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of immovables and enterprises can be avoided , each share shall , as far as possible , be composed of movable or immovable property and rights or claims of equivalent value . <p> Any inequality in the value of the shares is compensated by the payment of an equalizing sum . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 852 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; I.N. 2015-11-01 . <p> 853 . Heirs in indivision who make an amicable partition compose the shares as they see fit and decide , by mutual agreement , on their allotment or on a drawing of lots for them . <p> If they consider it necessary to sell all or some of the property to be partitioned , they also set , by mutual agreement , the terms and conditions of sale . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 853 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 854 . If the heirs in indivision fail to agree as to the composition of the shares , the shares are composed by an expert designated by the court ; if the failure to agree concerns the allotment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots . <p> Before the drawing , each heir in indivision may contest the composition of the shares . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 854 ; I.N. 2014-05-01. @qwx178830 <p> PREFERENTIAL ALLOTMENTS AND CONTESTATION <p> 855 . Each heir receives his share of the property of the succession in kind , and may apply for the allotment , by preference , of particular property or a share . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 855 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 856 . The surviving married or civil union spouse may , in preference to any other heir , require that the family residence or the rights conferring use of it , together with the movable property serving for the use of the household , be placed in his or her share . <p> If the value of the property exceeds the share due to the spouse , he or she keeps the property , subject to the payment of an equalizing sum . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 856 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 47 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 857 . Subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse , if several heirs apply for the allotment by preference of the immovable that served as the residence of the deceased , preference goes to the person who was residing there . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 857 ; 2002 , c. 6 , s. 48 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 858 . Notwithstanding any objection or application for an allotment by preference presented by another co-partitioner , the enterprise , or the shares or other securities connected with the enterprise , are allotted by preference to the heir who was actively participating in the operation of the enterprise at the time of the death . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 858 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 859 . If several heirs assert the same right of preference or if an application for an allotment is contested , the contestation is settled by a drawing of lots or , if it concerns the allotment of the residence , the enterprise or the securities connected with the enterprise , by the court . In this case , account is taken of , among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each party or the degree of his participation in the enterprise or in the maintenance of the residence . <p> 860 . Where the contestation among the co-partitioners is over the determination or payment of an equalizing sum , the court determines it and may , if necessary , fix the appropriate terms and conditions of guarantee and payment in the circumstances . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 860 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 861 . The property is appraised according to its condition and value at the time of partition . <p> 863 . If the interested persons can not agree , the court may , where applicable , designate experts to evaluate the property , order the sale of the property that can not conveniently be partitioned or allotted and fix the terms and conditions of sale ; or it may order a stay of partition for the time it indicates . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 863 . <p> 864 . In order that the partition not be made in fraud of their rights , the creditors of the succession and those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their own expense . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 864 ; I.N. 2014-05-01. @qwx178831 <p> DELIVERY OF TITLES <p> 865 . After partition , the titles common to all or part of the inheritance are delivered to the person chosen by the heirs to act as depositary , on the condition that he allow the co-partitioners to make use of them at their request . Failing agreement on the choice , it is made by a drawing of lots . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 865 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 118 . <p> 866 . At partition , any heir who so requests may obtain , at common expense , a copy of the titles to property in which he retains rights . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 866 ; I.N. 2014-05-01. @qwx178829 <p> RETURN <p> DIVISION I <p> RETURN OF GIFTS AND LEGACIES <p> 867 . With a view to partition , each coheir is bound to return to the mass only what he has received from the deceased by gift or by will under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounces the succession is under no obligation to make any return . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 867 . <p> 868 . A person who represents another in the succession is bound to return what the person represented would have had to return , in addition to what he is bound to return in his own right . <p> A return is due even if the person who represents the other has renounced the succession of the person represented . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 868 . <p> 869 . A return is made only to the succession of the donor or of the testator . <p> It is due only from one coheir to another and is not due to the legatees by particular title or to the creditors of the succession . <p> Any provision requiring the heir to make a return in kind is without effect . However , the heir may elect to make the return in kind if he still owns the property , unless he has charged it with a usufruct , servitude , hypothec or other real right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , c. 19 , s. 15 . <p> 871 . Each coheir to whom a return by taking less is due pre-takes from the mass of the succession property equal in value to the amount of the return . <p> As far as possible , pre-takings are made in property of the same kind and quality as the property due to be returned . <p> If it is impossible to pre-take in the manner described , the heir returning may either pay the cash value of the property received or allow each coheir to pre-take other property of equivalent value from the mass . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 871 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 119 . <p> 872 . A return by taking less may also be made by imputing the cash value of the property received to the share of the heir . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 872 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 873 . Unless otherwise provided in the gift or will , property returned by taking less is valued at the time of partition if it is still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alienation if it was alienated before partition . <p> Bequeathed property , and that which remains in the succession , is valued according to its condition and value at the time of partition . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 873 . <p> 874 . The value of property returned by taking less , or returned in kind , shall be reduced by the increase in value of the property resulting from the disbursements or personal initiative of the heir returning it . <p> It is also reduced by the amount of the necessary disbursements . <p> Conversely , the value is increased by the decrease in value resulting from the acts or omissions of the heir making the return . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 874 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 120 . <p> 875 . The heir is entitled to retain the property due to be returned in kind until he has been reimbursed the amounts he is owed . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 875 . <p> 876 . An heir is bound to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts or omissions ; he is not bound to do so if the loss results from superior force . <p> In either case , he shall return any indemnity paid to him for the loss of the property . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 876 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 877 . The co-partitioners may agree that property charged with a hypothec or other real right be returned in kind ; the return is then made without prejudice to the holder of the right . The obligation resulting therefrom is , in the partition of the succession , borne by the heir who makes the return . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 877 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 878 . The fruits and revenues of the property given or bequeathed , if the property is returned in kind , or the interest on the amount returnable , are also returnable from the opening of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 878. @qwx178830 <p> RETURN OF DEBTS <p> 879 . An heir coming to a partition shall return to the mass the debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amounts he owes to his co-partitioners by reason of the indivision . <p> These debts are subject to return even if they are not due when partition takes place ; they are not subject to return if the testator provided for release therefrom to take effect at the opening of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 879 . <p> 880 . If the amount in capital and interest of the debt to be returned exceeds the value of the hereditary share of the heir who is bound to make the return , the heir remains indebted for the excess and shall pay it according to the terms and conditions attached to the debt . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 880 . <p> 881 . If an heir bound to make a return has a claim of his own to make , even though it is not exigible at the time of partition , compensation is effected and he is bound to return only the balance of his debt . <p> Compensation is also effected if the claim exceeds the debt and the heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed to have inherited , alone and directly , all the property included in his share or which devolves to him through any partial or complete partition . He is deemed to have owned the property from the death , and never to have owned the other property of the succession . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 884 . <p> 885 . Any act the object of which is to terminate indivision between co-partitioners is equivalent to a partition , even though the act is described as a sale , an exchange , a transaction or otherwise . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 885 . <p> 886 . Subject to the provisions concerning the administration of undivided property and the juridical relationships between an heir and his successors , acts performed by an heir in indivision and real rights granted by him in property which has not been allotted to him may not be set up against any other heirs in indivision who have not consented to them . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 886 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 887 . Acts validly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of which heir receives the property at partition . <p> Each heir is then deemed to have made the acts concerning the property which devolves to him . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 887 . <p> 888 . The declaratory effect also applies to claims against third persons , to any assignment of these claims made during indivision by one of the coheirs and to any seizure in the hands of a third person of the claims by the creditors of one of the coheirs . <p> The setting up of the allotment of claims against debtors is subject to the rules of the Book on Obligations relating to assignment of claims . <p> 889 . Co-partitioners are warrantors towards each other only for the disturbances and evictions arising from a cause prior to the partition . <p> Nevertheless , each co-partitioner remains a warrantor for any eviction caused by his personal acts or omissions . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 889 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 890 . The insolvency of the debtor of a claim devolving to one of the co-partitioners gives rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the insolvency occurred prior to partition . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 890 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 891 . The warranty does not arise if the eviction has been excepted by a stipulation in the act of partition ; it terminates if the co-partitioner is evicted through his own fault . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 891 . <p> 892 . Each co-partitioner is personally bound in proportion to his share to indemnify his co-partitioner for the loss which the eviction has caused him . <p> The loss is valued as on the day of the partition . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 892 . <p> 893 . If one of the co-partitioners is insolvent , the indemnity for which he is bound shall be divided proportionately between the warrantee and all the solvent co-partitioners . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 893 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 894 . The action in warranty is prescribed by three years from eviction or discovery of the disturbance , or from partition if it is caused by the insolvency of a debtor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. 894 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> CHAPTER V <p> NULLITY OF PARTITION <p> 895 . Partition , even partial , may be annulled for the same causes as contracts . <p> However , instead of an annulment , a supplementary or corrective partition may be effected in any case where it is to the advantage of the co-partitioners . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 895 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 896 . Mere omission of undivided property does not give rise to an action in nullity , but only to a supplementary partition . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 896 . <p> 897 . In deciding whether lesion has occurred , the value of the property is considered as at the time of partition . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 897 . <p> 898 . The defendant in an action in nullity of partition may , in all cases , terminate the action and prevent a new partition by offering and delivering to the plaintiff the supplement from the defendant 's share of the succession , in money or in kind . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> BOOK FOUR <p> PROPERTY <p> GENERAL PROVISION <p> 2015 , c. 35 , s. 1 . <p> 898.1 .

Integral parts of an immovable that are temporarily detached therefrom retain their immovable character if they are destined to be put back . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 902 . <p> 903 . Movables which are permanently physically attached or joined to an immovable without losing their individuality and without being incorporated with the immovable are immovables for as long as they remain there and ensure the utility of the immovable . <p> However , movables which , in the immovable , are used to operate an enterprise or to carry on activities remain movables . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 903 ; 2013 , c. 27 , s. 28 . <p> 904 . Real rights in immovables , as well as actions to assert such rights or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Property that produces fruits and revenues , property appropriated for the service or operation of an enterprise , shares of a legal person or partnership , the reinvestment of the fruits and revenues , the price for any disposal of capital or its reinvestment , and expropriation or insurance indemnities in replacement of capital , are capital . <p> Capital also includes rights of intellectual or industrial property except sums derived therefrom without alienation of the rights , bonds and other loan certificates payable in cash and rights the exercise of which tends to increase the capital , such as the right to subscribe to securities of a legal person , limited partnership or trust . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 909 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 123 . <p> 910 . Fruits and revenues are that which is produced by property without any alteration to its substance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also include rights the exercise of which tends to increase the fruits and revenues of the property . <p> Fruits comprise things spontaneously produced by property or produced by the cultivation or working of land .

Co-owners may agree in writing to postpone the partition of property on expiry of the term provided for the indivision . <p> Such an agreement may not exceed 30 years , but is renewable . An agreement exceeding 30 years is reduced to that term . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1013 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 1014 .

Each co-owner may make use of the undivided property provided he does not affect its destination or the rights of the other co-owners . <p> If one of the co-owners has the use and exclusive enjoyment of the property , he is liable for an indemnity . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1016 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 1017 . The right of accession operates to the benefit of all the co-owners proportionately to their share in the indivision . Nevertheless , where a co-owner holds a right of use or exclusive enjoyment of a portion of the undivided property , he also has the use or exclusive enjoyment of anything joined or incorporated with that portion . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1017 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 1018 .

Any co-owner , within 60 days of learning that a third person has , by onerous title , acquired the share of a co-owner , may exclude him from the indivision by reimbursing him for the transfer price and the expenses he has paid . This right may be exercised only within one year from the acquisition of the share . <p> The right of withdrawal may not be exercised where the co-owners have stipulated pre-emptive rights in the indivision agreement and where such rights , if they are rights in an immovable , have been published . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1022 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 1023 .

Upon application by a co-owner , the court , to avoid a loss , may postpone the immediate partition of all or part of the property and maintain the indivision for at most two years . <p> The decision may be revised if the causes justifying the maintenance of the indivision have ceased to exist or if the indivision has become intolerable or presents great risks for the co-owners . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1032 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 ; 2016 , c. 4 , s. 132 . <p> 1033 .

If the co-owners fail to agree on the share in kind or in money to be apportioned to one of them , an appraisal or a valuation is made by a person designated by all the co-owners or , if they can not agree among themselves , by the court . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1034 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 1035 .

Indivision may be terminated by the decision of a majority in number of shares of the co-owners where a substantial part of the undivided property is lost or expropriated . <p> In the case of partition , the provisions relating to the partition of successions apply , adapted as required . <p> However , the act of partition which terminates indivision , other than indivision by succession , is an act of attribution of the right of ownership . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1037. @qwx178829 <p> DIVIDED CO-OWNERSHIP OF IMMOVABLES <p> DIVISION I <p> ESTABLISHMENT OF DIVIDED CO-OWNERSHIP <p> 1038 .

A servitude is a charge imposed on an immovable , the servient land , in favour of another immovable , the dominant land , belonging to a different owner . <p> Under the charge the owner of the servient land is required to tolerate certain acts of use by the owner of the dominant land or himself abstain from exercising certain rights inherent in ownership . <p> A servitude extends to all that is necessary for its exercise . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1177 . <p> 1178 . An obligation to do something may be attached to a servitude and imposed on the owner of the servient land . The obligation is an accessory to the servitude and can only be stipulated for the service or exploitation of the immovable . <p> A servitude is apparent if it is manifested by an external sign ; otherwise it is unapparent . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1180 . <p> 1181 . A servitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the owner or by operation of law . <p> It may not be established without title , and possession , even immemorial , is insufficient for this purpose . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1181 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 1182 . Servitudes are not affected by the transfer of ownership of the servient or dominant land . They remain attached to the immovables through changes of ownership , subject to the provisions relating to the publication of rights . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1182 . <p> 1183 . Servitude by destination of the owner is evidenced in writing by the owner of the land who , in contemplation of its future parcelling , immediately establishes the nature , scope and situation of the servitude on one part of the land in favour of other parts . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1183 ; I.N. 2014-05-01. @qwx178830 <p> EXERCISE OF SERVITUDES <p> 1184 . The owner of the dominant land may , at his own expense , take the measures or make all the works necessary for the exercise and preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servitude . <p> At the end of the servitude he shall , at the request of the owner of the servient land , restore the place to its former condition . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1184 . <p> 1185 . The owner of the servient land , charged by the title with making the necessary works for the exercise and preservation of the servitude , may free himself of the charge by abandoning the entire servient land or any part of it sufficient for the exercise of the servitude to the owner of the dominant land . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1185 . <p> 1186 . In no case may the owner of the dominant land make any change that would aggravate the situation of the servient land . <p> In no case may the owner of the servient land do anything that would tend to diminish the exercise of the servitude or to render it less convenient . However , he may , at his own expense , provided he has an interest in doing so , transfer the site of the servitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient to the owner of the dominant land . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1186 . <p> 1187 . If the dominant land is divided , the servitude remains due for each portion , but the situation of the servient land may not thereby be aggravated . <p> Thus , in the case of a right of way , all owners of lots resulting from the division of the dominant land shall exercise it over the same place . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1187 . <p> 1188 . Division of the servient land does not affect the rights of the owner of the dominant land . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1188 . <p> 1189 . Except in the case of land enclosed by that of others , a servitude of right of way may be redeemed where its usefulness to the dominant land is out of proportion to the inconvenience or depreciation it entails for the servient land . <p> Failing agreement , the court , if it grants the right of redemption , fixes the price , taking into account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servitude has existed and the change of value entailed by the servitude both in favour of the servient land and to the detriment of the dominant land . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1189 . <p> 1190 . The parties may , in writing , exclude the possibility of redeeming a servitude for a period of not over 30 years . <p> ( 1 ) - by the union of the qualities of owner of the servient land and owner of the dominant land in the same person ; <p> ( 2 ) - by the express renunciation of the owner of the dominant land ; <p> ( 3 ) - by the expiry of the term for which it was established ; <p> ( 4 ) - by redemption ; <p> ( 5 ) - by non-use for 10 years . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1191 . <p> 1192 . In the case of discontinuous servitudes , prescription begins to run from the day the owner of the dominant land ceases to exercise the servitude and , in the case of continuous servitudes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1192 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 1193 . The mode of exercising a servitude may be prescribed just as the servitude itself , and in the same manner . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1193 . <p> 1194 . Prescription runs even where the dominant land or the servient land undergoes a change of such a kind as to render exercise of the servitude impossible . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1194 . <p> CHAPTER IV <p> EMPHYTEUSIS <p> DIVISION I <p> NATURE OF EMPHYTEUSIS <p> 1195 .

The owner has the same obligations towards the emphyteuta as a seller . <p> 1991 , c. 64 , a. 1206 ; I.N. 2014-05-01 . <p> 1207 . Where a price payable in a lump sum or by instalments is fixed in the constituting act and the emphyteuta fails to pay it for three years , the owner is entitled , after at least 90 days ' notice , to apply for resiliation of the constituting act . <p> Resiliation may not be applied for where divided co-ownership is established on a building built by the emphyteuta .

They are women and men who live in extreme conditions , without a roof over their heads or in squalid housing , for instance . Frequently marginalized and scorned , they are often not considered full citizens in a society that is one of the richest in the world . <p> Yet every day , this unacceptable situation is tolerated . This tolerance of the situation has become the social norm , in which , at best , people feel compassion for the homeless during periods of extreme cold . This tolerance also feeds preconceived notions about homelessness . For instance , the belief that it is an inevitable phenomenon and that there will always be homeless people regardless of the efforts made to help them . <p> Another common prejudice is that homeless people are responsible for their situation , and that living on the street is a personal choice . In most cases , the street is the culmination of a life trajectory peppered with difficulties and painful and challenging failures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Homeless ? <h> Men <p> Adult males are the largest group of homeless people .

Nonetheless , their presence on the street is less noticeable .

Since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 , CMS has implemented a variety of VBP strategies , including incentive programs and risk-based alternative payment models . Early evidence from these programs raised concerns about potential unintended consequences for health equity . Specifically , emerging evidence suggests that providers disproportionately serving patients with social risk factors for poor health outcomes ( e.g. , individuals with low socioeconomic position , racial and ethnic minorities , gender and sexual minorities , socially isolated persons , and individuals residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods ) may be more likely to fare poorly on quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive financial rewards . <p> The drivers of these disparities are poorly understood , and differences in interpretation have led to divergent concerns about the potential effect of VBP on health equity . Some suggest that underlying differences in patient characteristics that are out of the control of providers lead to differences in health outcomes . At the same time , others are concerned that differences in outcomes between providers serving socially at-risk populations and providers serving the general population reflect disparities in the provision of health care . <p> Systems Practices for the Care of Socially At-Risk Populations seeks to better distinguish the drivers of variations in performance among providers disproportionately serving socially at-risk populations and identifies methods to account for social risk factors in Medicare payment programs . This report identifies best practices of high-performing hospitals , health plans , and other providers that serve disproportionately higher shares of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and compares those best practices of low-performing providers serving similar patient populations .

@@13586293 @2186293/ <p> This article makes an important contribution to the literature by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to creating composite measures and also by summarizing key issues related to the use of the various methods . <p> Composite measures are a useful complement to individual measures when profiling and creating incentives for improvement , but because of the sensitivity of results to the methods used to create composite measures , careful analysis is necessary before they are implemented . <h> Context <p> Since the Institute of Medicine 's 2001 report Crossing the Quality Chasm , there has been a rapid proliferation of quality measures used in quality-monitoring , provider-profiling , and pay-for-performance ( P4P ) programs . Although individual performance measures are useful for identifying specific processes and outcomes for improvement and tracking progress , they do not easily provide an accessible overview of performance . Composite measures aggregate individual performance measures into a summary score . By reducing the amount of data that must be processed , they facilitate ( 1 ) benchmarking of an organization 's performance , encouraging quality improvement initiatives to match performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P4P programs based on an organization 's overall performance . <h> Methods <p> We describe different approaches to creating composite measures , discuss their advantages and disadvantages , and provide examples of their use . <h> Findings <p> The major issues in creating composite measures are ( 1 ) whether to aggregate measures at the patient level through all-or-none approaches or the facility level , using one of the several possible weighting schemes ; ( 2 ) when combining measures on different scales , how to rescale measures ( using z scores , range percentages , ranks , or 5-star categorizations ) ; and ( 3 ) whether to use shrinkage estimators , which increase precision by smoothing rates from smaller facilities but also decrease transparency . <h> Conclusions <p> Because provider rankings and rewards under P4P programs may be sensitive to both context and the data , careful analysis is warranted before deciding to implement a particular method . A better understanding of both when and where to use composite measures and the incentives created by composite measures are likely to be important areas of research as the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care organizations has received increasing attention since the publication of the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) report To Err Is Human , which described a health care system replete with both quality and efficiency problems. 1 The IOM 's companion report , Crossing the Quality Chasm , called for major health care system reforms in order to achieve safe , effective , efficient , timely , patient-centered , and equitable health care. 2 Since 2001 , there has been a rapid proliferation of quality measures put forth by both federal and private organizations for hospital-profiling and pay-for-performance ( P4P ) programs . For example , in 2002 , the Hospital Quality Alliance , a public-private consortium , advocated the development of a national public database of condition-specific hospital performance measures that would serve as measures of hospital quality . Since the establishment of the Hospital Compare website in 2005 , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) has added a large number of process and outcome measures . <p> Although individual performance measures are useful for identifying specific processes and outcomes for improvement and tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of performance . Further , the plethora of recently developed quality measures may contribute to confusion and add to the burden of managers and potential users who may want ( and need ) simple ways to understand whether and by how much an organization is improving . Composite measures , which aggregate individual performance measures into summary scores , reduce the amount of data that must be processed and provide a clearer picture of overall performance. 3 Composite measures also can serve multiple purposes and stakeholders . Macro-level composite measures , such as the total performance score calculated as part of the CMS Hospital Value-Based Purchasing ( VBP ) Program4 ( discussed in more detail later ) , provide a useful summary of the extent to which management has created a " culture of excellence " and designed processes to ensure high performance in delivering services throughout the organization . For senior leaders , composite measures allow them to benchmark their organization 's performance against high-performing organizations and to monitor changes over time . For mid-level managers , composite measures allow them to track a particular service or unit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a composite measure that combines different dimensions of performance into a single number is more easily understood than a large number of individual performance measures . For policymakers , composite measures provide performance criteria to use in selecting high-performing providers to include in health care delivery networks . For health care payers , a composite measure can facilitate the creation of P4P programs that differentially pay providers on the basis of overall performance . Finally , for researchers , composite measures can help identify high-performing organizations , which can then be studied to identify characteristics that distinguish them from lower-performing organizations . <p> Despite these multiple purposes , composite measures are not useful for targeting specific areas of improvement . Instead , the individual measures comprising the composite must be examined in order to determine and prioritize where specific improvement efforts should be concentrated . Thus , it is important that the individual measures be of high quality . In discussing its most recent criteria for endorsing composite measures , the National Quality Forum ( NQF ) noted that although " NQF endorsement is not necessary for the component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make judgments about performance . . . the individual component measures should meet specific subcriteria , such as for clinical evidence and performance gap . " 5 <p> Specific criteria also are used to assess the measurement properties and performance of composite measures . For example , the NQF 's criteria include the following : ( 1 ) evidence , performance gap , and priorityimportance to measure and report ; ( 2 ) reliability and validityscientific acceptability of measure properties ; ( 3 ) feasibility ; and ( 4 ) usability and use . The American College of Cardiology Foundation / American Heart Association Task Force on Performance Measures 2010 Position Statement on Composite Measures for Healthcare Performance Assessment also provides a concise review of many issues related to composite measures. 6 <p> Recent experience with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) Patient Safety Indicator ( PSI ) -90 composite , used by CMS as a component of the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program and the Hospital VBP Program , reinforces the need for specific evaluation criteria for composite measures and also illustrates some of the challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created from 8 individual PSIs identified from administrative data , has not yet been endorsed by the NQF because of the controversy surrounding its use in the Hospital VBP Program. 7 Specifically , these concerns relate to the reliability and validity of specific individual measures ( eg , postoperative venous thromboembolism is vulnerable to surveillance bias , so event rates can be higher when there is increased surveillance ) ; accuracy of the adverse events identified ( eg , diagnostic codes for unintentional injury are used to identify adverse events like accidental puncture or laceration , even though studies have shown that they often are not meaningful or clinically relevant unintentional injuries ) ; inadequate risk adjustment because of reliance on administrative data ; and the use of weights to create the composite that assume that the level of harm associated with each component measure is the same . <p> The purpose of our article is to describe and illustrate , through examples , the different approaches to creating composite measures and the advantages and limitations of each approach . The article is divided into 8 sections . After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a composite measure can be conceptualized , as either a reflective or a formative construct. 8 We then illustrate the implications of different weighting schemes for composite measures conceptualized as formative constructs and the major ways in which individual measures comprising the composite might be rescaled before being combined into a composite . The next section gives specific examples of composite measures conceptualized as reflective constructs , with a particular emphasis on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ( HCAHPS ) survey ( also referred to as the CAHPS Hospital Survey ) . Following this , we discuss improvements in measure precision and reliability that result from using composite measures , and we briefly consider issues of validity . Next we describe shrinkage estimators that , by taking into account differences in the precision of individual measures from providers of different sizes , can lead to better estimates of both individual measures and composite measures . We briefly examine the different perspectives of composite measures when used in profiling and P4P programs . Finally , we offer conclusions about key issues when developing composite measures and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article , we use the general term " provider " or " facility " to refer to the organizations delivering health care services . Specific examples of composite measures are from different types of providers : hospitals , service units within hospitals ( eg , surgery ) , health plans , nursing homes , family practices , and individual clinicians . <h> Two Alternative Ways to Conceptualize a Composite Measure <h> Reflective Constructs <p> To illustrate the alternative conceptualizations , consider a composite measure representing an organization 's quality of care . Quality may be conceptualized as an inherent or latent characteristic of the organization that is " reflected " in specific quality measures . For example , similar to a student who is good in mathematics ( an underlying characteristic of the person ) and does well on mathematics tests , an organization that provides high-quality care also does well on empirical measures of quality . When conceptualized in this way , quality is a " reflective " construct . A reflective construct exists independently of the specific measures used to measure it , and thus specific measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the construct . The distinguishing feature of a reflective construct is that the direction of causality is from the construct to the empirical measures ; that is , the empirical measures are high or low because the construct is high or low . Therefore , to improve quality , interventions should focus on the construct rather than on the specific measures . An organization might want to focus interventions on one or more of its underlying characteristics , such as culture ( is there a culture of quality ? ) , resources ( are sufficient resources allocated to quality improvement ? ) , or training ( do employees have sufficient job knowledge and skills ? ) . Because the empirical measures reflect the underlying construct , they generally are highly correlated . Statistical approaches like principal components analysis and factor analysis are widely used to find sets of correlated measures that are hypothesized to reflect underlying latent constructs . <h> Formative Constructs <p> Alternatively , a construct can be conceptualized as " formative " ; that is , it is formed from the empirical measures used to measure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not exist independently of the empirical measures , and the meaning of the construct will change if there are any changes in the measures associated with the construct . The goal in defining a formative construct is to identify a range of measures that capture the different dimensions of the performance in which one is interested , rather than different measures that reflect the same characteristic or trait , as in the case of a reflective construct . Thus , in contrast to a reflective construct , the measures defining a formative construct are not necessarily highly correlated , as they are selected purposefully to measure different dimensions of performance . <p> To illustrate , consider a person 's socioeconomic status , which might be measured by a combination of education , income , occupation , and residence . These empirical measures define what is meant by socioeconomic status ; they are not reflections of some underlying characteristic of a person . If one changes the measures that define socioeconomic status , then one changes the meaning of the term . If one wants to intervene to improve socioeconomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual measures used to define the construct , such as an individual 's opportunity for additional education . Similarly , if one wants to improve quality conceptualized as a formative construct , one has to target the specific measures used to define the construct . <p> Because sets of quality measures are typically not highly correlated , particularly when the measures are selected from different domains of care ( eg , processes , outcomes , patient satisfaction , efficiency ) , formative constructs are used much more widely for composite measures than reflective constructs . Next we look at a number of important issues associated with formative constructs and then briefly consider reflective constructs . <h> Formative Constructs <h> Weighting <p> Since a formative construct is not based on the hypothesis that the measures are correlated , the correlation structure of the data can not be used to determine the construct . Rather , the construct is estimated by taking a weighted average of the measures that comprise the construct . To illustrate the different weighting schemes commonly used , consider a single facility and 3 types of adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse event , the number of patients " eligible " to experience the event and the number of events . <p> Table 1 . How Weights Are Calculated <p> Type of <p> Number of <p> Adverse <p> Opportunity- <p> Numerator- <p> Adverse <p> Number <p> Adverse <p> Event Rate <p> Equal <p> Based <p> Based <p> Event <p> Eligible <p> Events <p> by Type <p> Weights <p> Weights <p> Weights <p> A <p> 100 <p> 20 <p> 20/100 = .20 <p> .333 <p> 100/200 = .50 <p> 20/80 = .25 <p> B <p> 60 <p> 40 <p> 40/60 = .667 <p> .333 <p> 60/200 = .30 <p> 40/80 = .50 <p> C <p> 40 <p> 20 <p> 20/40 = .50 <p> .333 <p> 40/200 = .20 <p> 20/80 = .25 <p> Total <p> 200 <p> 80 <h> Equal Weights <p> Equal weights assign a weight of one-third to each type of adverse event , which results in a composite score of 0.456 , as shown in Table 2 . This approach has strong intuitive appeal when there is no basis for distinguishing differences in the seriousness of impact on patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , without strong justification for differential weights , equal weighting should be the norm . It is not clear , however , that the intent of equal weighting is actually best achieved by using equal weights . To illustrate , consider reducing each type of adverse events by 10 events . As shown in Table 2 , the resulting composite scores are not the same . Equal weighting creates an incentive to focus on Type C events , since this will lead to the greatest reduction in the composite score . It is straightforward to show that the same composite score will result by reducing Type A events by 10 , Type B events by 6 , or Type C events by 4 . Assuming it costs the same to achieve a reduction of 1 adverse event for each of the 3 types of events , equal weighting of event rates creates unequal incentives for reducing the 3 types of events . This example demonstrates how one can be misled if the weight is used as the basis for prioritizing interventions rather than the impact on the composite measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominator-based weights ) are calculated as the number of people eligible for each type of adverse event ( ie , the number of opportunities for an adverse event ) divided by the sum of the numbers eligible for each type of event ( Table 1 ) , resulting in a composite score of 0.400 ( Table 2 ) . As Table 2 shows , the composite score can be calculated most directly as the sum of the number of adverse events across types divided by the sum of the number eligible for each type of adverse event . Thus , a 10-person reduction in each type of adverse event has exactly the same impact on the composite measure . Opportunity-based weights result in the same incentive to focus on each type of adverse event . In addition , opportunity-based weights take into account the differences in the types of patients that a provider might care for , to the extent these differences are reflected in the number of people eligible for each measure ( eg , the number eligible for diabetes-related measures compared with the number eligible for measures related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numerator-based weights are calculated as the number of people who experience each type of adverse event divided by the sum of the number of people who experience each of the adverse events , resulting in a composite score of 0.508 . As Table 2 illustrates , numerator-based weights can lead to counterintuitive incentives . When Type A events are reduced by 10 , the composite score actually increases . The reason is because of the much larger weight associated with Type B events ( the weight increases from 0.50 to 0.57 ) and the relatively higher rate associated with Type C events . Also , even though the numerator-based weight is the same for Type A and Type C events , the impact of a reduction in each type of event on the composite is not the same . Numerator-based weights can create disincentives to focus on the less prevalent types of events and very strong incentives to focus on the more prevalent types of events . Contrast this approach with opportunity-based weights , which encourage interventions in those types of adverse events that are most easily reduced ( since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has the same effect on the composite ) . <p> The important assumption in these examples is that the cost to reduce each type of adverse event by one is similar . This may be a reasonable assumption if the method by which the adverse events are reduced relates to the performance of a specific set of activities for each individual patient . But if the way in which adverse events are reduced is by a process redesign , it might be more reasonable to assume an equal percentage reduction for each of the types of adverse events . Under this assumption , there are strong incentives to focus on the most prevalent types of adverse events , incentives that will be strongly reinforced if numerator-based weights are used . <p> Both numerator- and opportunity-based weights are most useful when calculated separately for each hospital . From a policy perspective , however , it often is useful to have a common set of weights that apply to all hospitals . In this case , the number of events ( numerators ) and the number of eligible cases ( denominators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of events and a total number eligible for each type of event in the population . The composite is then calculated from these totals using one of the approaches just described . For example , AHRQ uses numerator-based weights calculated from this type of aggregation across all hospitals for the PSI-90 composite measure. 10 <p> Although our focus in this discussion has been on measures that can be expressed as proportions , these same approaches work for outcome measures expressed as the ratio of observed events to expected events ( O/E ratios ) , where the expected events are derived from a risk-adjustment model . In this case , the composite measure using opportunity-based weights is calculated as the sum of the Os ( across all conditions being studied ) divided by the sum of the Es . CMS often uses a random effects model for risk adjustment . In this case , the numerator is the predicted risk for a specific hospital ( calculated by adding a hospital-level factor to the risk-adjustment model ) , and the denominator is the predicted risk for an average hospital ( ie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( hospital-specific predicted divided by average-hospital predicted ) can be similarly combined into a composite . <h> All-or-None Measures <p> All-or-none measures11 use equal weighting of the individual measures but aggregate results at the patient level rather than at the hospital level , as in the preceding examples . To illustrate , consider a specific medical condition for which there are 6 evidence-based processes associated with high-quality care . Rather than using as a performance measure the proportion of individuals eligible for each process measure who receive the intervention , one might take the patients perspective and ask , " What proportion of patients received all 6 interventions for which they were eligible ? " The composite measure is the proportion of patient " successes , " that is , the proportion of patients who receive all the interventions for which they are eligible . This is equivalent to assigning to each measure a 1 ( if the patient received the intervention ) or a 0 , averaging the results , and calling the patient a success if the average equals 1 . In introducing the all-or-none measure , Nolan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminates excellence in a societal enterprise that should not be satisfied with partial credit or incomplete execution and should have widespread adoption . " 11(p1170) <p> We should distinguish an all-or-none measure from the more general term , " a bundle . " Whereas the former term focuses on specific process of care measures delivered to the patient , the latter is a grouping of " best practices with respect to a disease process that individually improve care , but when applied together result in substantially greater improvement . " 12 For example , hand decontamination immediately before and after each episode of patient contact would be considered part of a bundle rather than an all-or-none measure , since no process intervention was directly delivered to the patient . <p> As noted , all-or-none measures implicitly assume that each process component is equally important . One might modify the set of " required " processes by identifying a core set for which there is the strongest evidence of benefit and then restrict the all-or-none measure to this core set . Alternatively , one might count as a success a patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes , an approach that again counts each measure as equally important . For adverse events , it is straightforward to extrapolate an " all-or-none " measure to an " any-or-none " measure . That is , patients are successes if they do not experience any adverse events . Similar to the all-or-none measure , this approach treats all adverse events as equally harmful . In developing a composite measure of performance for coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , the Society of Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) Quality Management Task Force ( QMTF ) used an all-or-none approach to calculate a composite measure from 4 measures of perioperative care and an any-or-none approach to calculate a composite from 5 measures of postoperative risk-adjusted major morbidity. 13 A number of states , including Minnesota and Wisconsin , also use all-or-none composite measures for profiling and in P4P programs . For example , Minnesota uses all-or-none composite measures for clinic patients needing specific types of care : diabetes care ( 5 component measures ) , vascular care ( 4 component measures ) , and asthma care ( 3 component measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heart failure ( 3 component measures ) and pneumonia ( 2 component measures ) . 14 <h> Weighting Based on Expert Judgment <p> Weights based on expert judgment are sometimes used to calculate a composite measure . The Leapfrog Composite Safety Score illustrates a thoughtful approach to developing a judgment-based weighting system. 15 The weights were determined by a 9-member expert panel in a multistage process . First , " discussion and repeated voting to maximize consensus " were used to select 26 measures from an initial list of 45 candidate measures . Weights were developed for each measure by assigning points based on the following criteria : strength of evidence ( 1 or 2 points ) , opportunity for improvement ( a score between 1 and 3 based on the coefficient of variation ) , and impact , which was measured by summing the points associated with the percentage of patients affected ( 1 to 3 points ) and " severity of harm " ( 1 to 3 points ) . Because all the individual measures had already met a high standard of evidence , opportunity and impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calculated as <p> evidence score + ( opportunity score*impact score ) . <p> To convert the weight score to a percentage weight , the weight scores for each measure in each domain ( structure/process and outcome ) were summed , and the final weight for each measure was calculated as <p> Multiplying by 0.50 in the equation enables the process/structure measures and the outcome measures each to contribute 50% to the composite measure . Finally , before the composite score was calculated , all measures were standardized by subtracting the overall mean and then dividing by the standard deviation ( explained later ) . <h> Consumer Judgment <p> Consumer judgment can also be used to set weights , for example , by designing a system that allows potential consumers the flexibility to enter their own set of weights . A news item in Significance describes LineUp as an <p> open-source application that allows ordinary citizens to make quick , easy judgments about rankings that are based on multiple attributes . LineUp allows users to assign weights to different parameters to create a custom ranking . . . they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects the rankings. 16(p3) <p> Adding this feature to websites would allow consumers to rate their provider 's performance based on their judgment about the relative importance of different measures or domains . If users of the website were asked to indicate their preferred weights , over time a database could be built from which weights reflecting the average views of consumers could be derived . For example , in the Quality Rating System and Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Experience Survey ( currently in beta testing ) , which will be used to evaluate Qualified Health Plans offering coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces , 3 broad domain scores ( clinical quality management ; enrollee experience ; and plan efficiency , affordability , and management ) are combined into a final global rating. 17 Consumers could be offered the option of specifying their own weights for the 3 broad domains , as well as weights for the subdomain scores that are aggregated to calculate the broad domain scores . <p> In summary , the main advantages of each approach are that equal weighting is the most intuitive ; opportunity-based weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust for case-mix differences ; numerator-based weights create a strong incentive to focus on the most prevalent measures ; all-or-none measures are patient focused and the most consistent with a commitment to the highest quality ; expert panels can make judgments about dimensions such as the level of harm associated with each measure ( a dimension missing from all the other approaches ) ; and consumer-based weighting aligns mostly closely with **26;437;TOOLONG care . <h> Impact of Alternative Methods on Provider Profiles <p> A number of authors have examined the impact of the different methods for creating composites on provider profiles . Reeves and colleagues18 compared the following 5 methods : ( 1 ) all-or-none ; ( 2 ) 70% standard , a modification of all-or-none in which a patient is considered a success if 70% or more of the process measures for which a patient is eligible are delivered ; ( 3 ) overall percentage , in which the composite is calculated using opportunity-based weights ; ( 4 ) measure average , in which the composite is calculated by averaging the proportion of times each process measure was delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights ) ; and ( 5 ) patient average , a composite that is the percentage of measures for which the patient was eligible that were delivered . In one analysis that used data on 200 measures covering 23 conditions from 16 family practices in the United Kingdom the rank of practices " varied considerably " by method . For example , when the measure average and the patient average were compared , 56% of the practices changed places by more than a quarter of all rank positions . In another analysis , which considered 3 conditions ( coronary heart disease , asthma , and type 2 diabetes ) from 60 family practices , there were fewer large changes in the ranks , and many of the correlations between approaches were above 0.90 . However , there were large differences between the all-or-none ranks and those ranks using the other methods ( correlations were around 0.80 ) . Reeves and colleagues concluded that " different methods of computing composite quality scores can lead to different conclusions being drawn about both relative and absolute quality among health care providers . Different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18(p489) <p> Reeves and colleagues also offer a useful summary of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach . For example , for the following criteria , the all-or-none approach has either some or considerable advantage : It assesses quality with respect to the care given to each patient ; it is appropriate when the desired outcome depends on completing a full set of tasks ; it is suitable when individual patient scores are required ; and it allows standard errors to be estimated using standard distributional methods . Similarly , opportunity-based weights have some or considerable advantage for the following : They assess quality with respect to each opportunity to provide care ; the composite scores are not affected by the number of measures ; and they can be used with a smaller sample of patients ( ie , smaller standard errors ) . <p> Eapen and colleagues19 used both opportunity-based weights and the all-or-none approach to calculate a composite measure from 6 process measures , using data from more than 194,000 acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) patients from 334 hospitals . They found that although there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.7% vs. 7.4% ) , the 2 scoring methods resulted in both composites and hospital rankings that were highly correlated with each other ( r = 0.98 and r = 0.93 , respectively ) , as well as similar rankings of the top and bottom hospital quintiles . Interestingly , they also found that when more process measures were added , the 2 methods produced similar changes in hospital rankings . <p> The conclusions that Jacobs , Goddard , and Smith20 reached were similar to those of Reeves and colleagues with respect to the impact of different methods on hospital profiling . Jacobs and colleagues raised another important issue : when decision rules are used to place providers into categories based on performance on individual measures ( eg , providers might be assigned 1 to 5 stars , depending on the proportion of measures above some threshold ) , the ranking of organizations can be particularly sensitive to thresholds on individual measures . If providers are placed into a category based on a composite measure , the category assignments can be quite unstable . <p> To summarize these studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighting methods used to calculate the composite score is dependent on the data set used and the context in which the composite is applied . When increasingly large numbers of performance measures from different domains are used , the results are more sensitive to the weighting approach . Nevertheless , in any given situation , it is necessary to evaluate alternative approaches in order to understand the implications of using one or another of the approaches . <h> Rescaling the Individual Measures Before Creating a Composite Score <p> Different types of measures are sometimes combined into a composite measure , for example , patient satisfaction , which might be measured on a scale of 1 to 10 ; adherence to a process measure , which varies from 0% to 100% ; and an O/E ( observed/expected ) ratio , which might vary from 0.2 to 5.0 or more . Before combining such measures , it is important to rescale the individual measures . <p> The 2 most widely used methods of rescaling are ( 1 ) using z scores and ( 2 ) using a proportion of the range scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated as <p> where the maximum and minimum values represent the performance of the highest and lowest performing facilities . The denominator is referred to as the " range of the data . " <p> Tables 3 and 4 present examples of the 2 different methods of rescaling for 2 process measures with different amounts of variation . They give the calculation of rescaled scores using both the z score ( Table 3 ) and the proportion of the range score ( Table 4 ) , as well as the calculation of the composite score by averaging the rescaled scores ( ie , using equal weights ) . They also show the impact of improving each of the process measures by one rescaled unit . Note that although the scores have been rescaled so that the 2 process measures differences in variation do not affect the composite score , an improvement of one rescaled unit is harder to achieve in the original units for the process measure with the larger variation . For example , in Table 3 , to improve the composite score by 0.5 , one could increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Increasing process 1 by one rescaled unit requires an improvement in adherence from the current level of 86% to 94% ; however , increasing process 2 by one rescaled unit requires an improvement in adherence from 76% to 92% . In its development of the CABG composite , the STS QMTF considered both methods of rescaling before combining the scores from each of the 4 domains comprising the composite . The correlation between the 2 sets of rescaled scores was 0.99 . The QMTF thus decided to use the z score approach to rescaling. 13 <p> A third approach sometimes used for rescaling is to convert each measure into a rank and then to average the ranks . The performance of 2 providers that differ by one rank on a particular measure may be either slightly or very different . This is because information about their relative differences in performance is lost when conversion to ranks is used for rescaling . As a result , it is unclear how much an improvement on a measure will contribute to a change in ranks . In its scorecard on state health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine composite measures by domain and across all domains. 21 <p> In some cases , scores within different domains are categorized , usually into 1 of 5 categories , and then are given 1 to 5 stars . These categorical scores are then combined into an overall composite categorization . For example , in the CMS 's Nursing Home Compare Five-Star Quality Rating System , 22 the following 3 domains are considered : health inspection ratings , staffing measures , and performance on 11 quality measures . The health inspection score is calculated based on points assigned to health deficiencies identified in inspections and complaint investigations , and then in each state , facilities are assigned 1 to 5 stars . The top 10% of nursing homes in a state receive 5 stars ; the next 3 groups , each with 23.3% of the homes , receive 4 to 2 stars , respectively ; and the worst 20% receive 1 star . The staffing measure is based on the total number of nursing hours per resident day and the number of RN hours per resident day . A nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffing measure , and these in turn are combined into a 1- to 5-star categorization for staffing . For most of the quality measures ( there are slight adjustments for low prevalence measures ) , facilities are grouped into quintiles based on the national distribution of facilities and are assigned points based on their quintile . The points are summed across measures , and then the facilities are mapped into a star category . A complicated algorithm is then used to combine the star categorizations across the 3 domains . To give a flavor of this approach , the first 2 steps are as follows : ( 1 ) start with the health inspection 5-star rating ; and ( 2 ) add 1 star to the Step 1 result if the staffing rating is 4 or 5 stars and greater than the health inspection rating , but subtract 1 star if staffing is 1 star . At this step , the overall rating must be between 1 and 5 stars . <p> The Quality Rating System developed by CMS for Qualified Health Plans issuing coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then rolled up into a 5-category global score . Much of the transparency of the 5-star systems is lost when 5-star category assignments are rolled up into increasingly broad domains and then a final 5-star classification . In addition , the star systems ease of interpretation comes at a real cost for some facilities , that is , arbitrary classification of facilities with scores near thresholds that define each category . Shwartz and colleagues23 illustrate this using a composite measure based on the probability that a facility is in different quantiles . They classified 112 US Veterans Affairs ( VA ) nursing homes into star categories and then showed that 4 of the 5 facilities ranked in the bottom 5 in the 4-star category based on the point estimate of their composite score had more than a 40% chance of really being 3-star or lower facilities . Four of the top 5 facilities in the 3-star category had more than a 39% chance of being a 4-star or higher facility . <p> Spiegelhalter and colleagues24 discussed several thoughtful approaches to rating organizations , deciding which to inspect , and monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among their suggestions are the following : ( 1 ) transform individual measures so their distribution follows a normal ( bell-shaped ) distribution ( they suggest a number of transformations for different types of measures ) ; ( 2 ) rescale the measures using the z score approach ; ( 3 ) make adjustments to avoid the impact of extreme values , the easiest of which is to " winsorize " the rescaled scores , that is , to reset scores above and below some specified threshold ( eg , 3 standard deviations from the mean ) to the high or low threshold , at which point the standard deviation is recalculated and new rescaled scores are determined ; and ( 4 ) combine the rescaled scores into a composite using an approach that down-weights sets of highly correlated scores ( since they provide the same information ) . <h> Reflective Constructs <h> Surveys <p> Surveys are one of the most important areas in which reflective constructs are used and in which psychometrics predominates . In many cases , the goal of a survey is to assess respondents attitudes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latent construct that is reflected in questions related to the domain . One would expect the answers to these questions to be highly correlated , since they are reflecting the same underlying latent construct , and to have a lower correlation with responses to questions reflecting other domains . The challenge in survey development is to identify a series of questions related to each domain but unrelated to other domains . Much of the psychometric analysis of pilot survey data involves using various statistical analyses ( principal components analysis or factor analysis predominates ) to demonstrate that sets of questions related to specific domains are highly correlated and that questions related to different domains have relatively lower correlations . <p> To combine domain-specific questions into a domain-specific composite score , one could weight each question by the component or factor loadings ( if principal components analysis or factor analysis were used to identify sets of correlated questions ) . This is rarely done , however . Rather , a composite measure for each domain is usually calculated by averaging the responses to questions associated with that domain ; that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will then be multiple composite measures , one for each domain . If an overall summary measure is desired , the same challenge will exist as in a formative construct : weighting the various domain composite scores in order to arrive at the summary measure . <p> We use the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ( HCAHPS ) survey , developed through a rigorous , multistep process , to illustrate survey-based composite measures. 25 A variety of psychometric analyses were conducted using HCAHPS data. 26 The 2013 version of the survey contains 25 substantive questions grouped into major domains reflecting patients experiences : care from nurses , care from doctors , the hospital environment , experiences in the hospital , experiences related to discharge , extent of understanding of postdischarge care at the time of discharge , and the overall rating of the hospital . For example , the 4 questions under care from nurses ( which are answered " never , " " sometimes , " " usually , " and " always " and scored 1 to 4 points , respectively ) are ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did nurses treat you with courtesy and respect ? " ( 2 ) " During this hospital stay , how often did nurses listen carefully to you ? " ( 3 ) " During this hospital stay , how often did nurses explain things in a way you could understand ? " and ( 4 ) " During this hospital stay , after you pressed the call button , how often did you get help as soon as you wanted it ? " The score for the nursing domain is calculated by averaging the responses to these 4 questions . <p> Instead of calculating an overall composite reflecting consumers ' attitudes toward their hospital experience by averaging domain-specific composite scores across the domains , HCAHPS asks 2 broad questions to capture the " gestalt " of the hospital stay : ( 1 ) " Using any number from 0 to 10 , where 0 is the worst hospital possible and 10 is the best hospital possible , what number would you use to rate this hospital ? " and ( 2 ) " Would you recommend this hospital to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-point scale of " definitely no , " " probably no , " " probably yes , " and " definitely yes . " ) Because the consumer has first been motivated to think about and score the different dimensions of hospital care , it is not unreasonable to then ask , " Pulling all of this together , what is your overall assessment of the hospital stay ? " The major advantage of this approach is that the implicit weighting needed to go from the domain scores to an overall assessment reflects consumers preferences and is thus patient centered . But it also has a disadvantage : Because the hospital does not know how the consumer felt about the relative importance of the different dimensions of hospital care , this type of implicit composite provides little guidance on which major areas to target for improvement . <h> Other Examples of Reflective Constructs <p> Because reflective constructs require correlation among subsets of measures , they are more widely used when the measures reflect specific domains of care . For example , Glickman and colleagues27 considered the 8 process measures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure from 4,226 acute care hospitals on the Hospital Compare database ( though they combined 2 of the AMI measures into a single measure ) . They found that 2 principal components adequately represented the correlations in the data . One component was conceptualized as " clinical " ( ie , pharmacologic interventions ) and the second as " administrative " ( ie , patient instructions or counseling activities ) . These 2 areas better reflect how hospitals organize the delivery of cardiac care than does a distinction based on therapeutic area ( AMI or heart failure ) . The authors demonstrated that the 2 composite scores were better able to predict AMI mortality in the next year than was a single score calculated using opportunity-based weights . <p> Shwartz and colleagues28 described the use of a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate an underlying construct " process quality " that is reflected in the 15 process measures originally monitored by CMS on the Hospital Compare website ( 6 measures for AMI , 4 for congestive heart failure , and 5 for pneumonia ) . Using data available from more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistically significant link between the underlying construct process quality and the 15 process measures . The authors compared rankings of hospitals based on the latent variable process quality with rankings based on a composite created using opportunity-based weights . Even though the ranks were highly correlated ( 0.92 ) , about 20% of the hospitals ranked in the top decile by one method were ranked in a lower decile ( usually the second decile ) by the other method . <h> Using Composite Measures to Increase Precision and Reliability and Considerations of Validity <p> Precision is a measure of how close an estimate calculated from a sample is to the " true " level of the variable if it were calculated from all patients in the population . The population may be " hypothetical , " for example , all potential users of a particular hospital if they need hospital care . The precision of an average calculated from a sample depends on the amount of variation in the variable , which is usually estimated by the standard deviation of the variable in the sample , and the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which for an average is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size . <p> To ensure some minimum level of precision and to reduce large fluctuations in rates over time due to random variation , policymakers frequently include a particular performance measure from a facility in profiling and P4P only if it has some minimum number of cases over a specified time period . For example , when publicly reporting risk-adjusted mortality and risk-adjusted readmission rates for AMI , heart failure , and pneumonia , CMS reports only the rates for those facilities that have at least 25 cases over a 3-year period . By considering a longer time period than the typical 1 year , CMS is able to include more facilities and increase the precision of reported rates . But this makes it more difficult to detect a significant change in performance in any 1 year , since prechange rates are included in the calculation of performance measures . For less frequently performed procedures or rarer conditions , smaller sample sizes might be used . For example , in its composite measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surgeons Quality Management Task Force uses all facilities that performed at least 10 isolated coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgeries in a year. 13 As we explain later , shrinkage estimators are an approach to " smooth " rates based on small sample sizes . <p> When individual rates are aggregated into composite measures , which measures to include and minimum sample sizes become more complex . In the CMS Hospital VBP Program , hospitals receive a clinical Process of Care Domain score if they had at least 10 cases during the 1-year performance period for at least 4 of the 12 process of care measures in the domain . Scores for each measure in the domain are summed and then " normalized " by calculating the percentage that the summed score is of the total possible score given the number of process measures included . The Outcome Domain consists of 3 mortality measures ( AMI , heart failure , and pneumonia ) , each of which requires a minimum of 25 cases ; the AHRQ PSI-90 ( Patient Safety Indicator-90 ) , which requires at least 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure ; and a central lineassociated bloodstream infection ( CLABSI ) measure , which requires at least 1 predicted infection . The Outcome Domain is calculated for only those hospitals in which the case minimum is met for 2 of the 5 measures . The final total performance score ( TPS ) is calculated as the weighted average of 4 domain scores : clinical processes ( 20% ) , patient experience ( 30% ) , outcome ( 30% ) , and efficiency ( 20% ) . 4 Hospitals need scores for at least 2 of the 4 domains in order for the TPS to be calculated . The weights associated with any excluded domains are distributed proportionally to the remaining domains . Similar to the way in which many performance measurement systems are operationalized , little justification is provided for the minimum sample sizes . Nonetheless , they likely reflect the best judgment of the policymakers and methodologists who helped develop the rules . <p> Missing data from facilities on processes of care or certain outcomes usually indicate that the facility does not provide the relevant services . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision by the facility to withhold unfavorable information . Accordingly , composite measures can be structured to reduce incentives to withhold information . To illustrate , 1 of the 2 domains in the CMS Hospital-Acquired Condition ( HAC ) Reduction Program is composed of the standardized infection rates ( SIRs ) for central lineassociated bloodstream infection ( CLABSI ) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection ( CAUTI ) . These data come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN ) , which collects self-reported data from hospitals . The current methodology assigns 10 points ( worst score ) for each measure in the domain when hospitals do not report NHSN data . If a hospital reports one NHSN measure but not the other , the hospital 's score is based solely on the single NHSN measure reported . CMS is considering a modification in the scoring , as follows : If a hospital does not submit data for either of the measures ( and does not have a waiver or exemption ) , then 10 points will be assigned to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive to submit data only for the infection with the lowest rate . <p> The use of composite scores may increase the level of precision compared with that of individual measures . This was examined by Van Doorn-Klomberg and colleagues29 using data from 455 Dutch family practices . They considered 12 clinical process measures for diabetes from 350 of these practices , 9 for cardiovascular disease and risk management ( CVD/RM ) from 342 practices , and 4 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) from 286 practices . Individual measures were the proportion of eligible patients receiving the indicated intervention , and composite measures were calculated for each condition by averaging the proportions across measures . Precision was measured as 1.96*standard error , which is the distance on each side of the mean of a 95% confidence interval . For most of the measures , a sample of about 100 cases was needed to attain 10% precision ( ie , to be 95% certain of being within plus or minus 10% of the population average ) for many of the practices . Through the use of composite scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most practices with much smaller samples than required for a single measure . If higher levels of precision are needed ( eg , under 5% ) , however , it would still be necessary to have a large number of cases for some conditions . The authors note that a composite score 's precision depends on performance on the individual measures ( high or low performance scores have lower standard errors ) and on the correlations among the measures ( measures with lower correlations contribute additional unique information ) . <p> Whereas precision measures how close to the " true " population value that an estimator from a sample is likely to be , reliability measures how well an estimator can distinguish between high- and low-performing providers . Total variation in a performance measure is due to both random variation of the measure among a provider 's patients ( within-provider variation ) and variation in the measure across sets of patients seen by different providers ( across-provider variation ) . The reliability of a performance measure is the ratio of variation across providers to the sum of variation across providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be difficult to detect a " signal " in a performance measure ( ie , information to distinguish among providers ) because of the large amount of " noise " in the data ( ie , the random variation within a provider ) . In general , a reliability of 0.70 or higher is considered acceptable for psychometric purposes. 30 <p> Scholle and colleagues31 examined the reliability of individual and composite quality measures using administrative data from 9 health plans in different regions of the United States . They considered 27 HEDIS ( Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set ) quality measures , which are process measures for preventive care and for both chronic and acute care conditions . For each quality measure , they examined reliability as a function of the number of eligible patients seen by individual providers . Composite scores were calculated for the preventive , chronic , and acute measures as well as overall by first standardizing each measure ( ie , calculating a z score ) and then using opportunity-based weights for aggregation . When a standard of 0.70 or higher was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluated on a single quality measure ; the largest percentages were 8% for colorectal cancer screening and 2% for nephropathy screening . When the overall composite measure was used , 15% to 20% of physicians could be reliably evaluated . <p> Kaplan and colleagues32 examined 11 diabetes process and intermediate outcome quality measures for 7,574 patients from 210 physicians . They calculated a composite score from an aggregation of 5 of the 6 process measures ( those with sufficient variation ) and 4 of the 5 intermediate outcome measures ( those that contributed to variation in the composite measure ) . The reliability of the composite score was greater than 0.80 . Kaplan and colleagues showed that after case-mix adjustment , the composite score could differentiate those physicians scoring in the highest quartile from those in the lowest . <p> The validity of measures of health care quality is difficult to evaluate both because quality is multidimensional and because there are few gold standards . NQF 's criteria5 state that " validity testing demonstrates that measure data elements are correct and/or the measure score correctly reflects the quality of care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold standards are lacking , operationalizing these criteria is a challenge . In part , validity of a composite measure rests on the validity of the component measures . But NQF also requires direct validity testing of the composite , though it recognizes that such tests are likely to focus on construct validity ( usually measured by correlating the composite measure with other measures of quality or by showing that the composite score differs among groups known to differ in quality measured by some other means ) . The problem is that there are likely to be concerns about the " other measures of quality . " Eapen and colleagues19 examined the correlation between composite measures of processes of care relevant to AMI patients ( calculated using both opportunity-based weights and an all-or-none approach ) and risk-standardized all-cause mortality and readmission rates . Both composite measures had a relatively low but statistically significant relationship with mortality ( r = -0.25 and r = -0.24 , p &lt; 0.001 , respectively ) but no relationship with readmissions . Is this a reflection of the construct validity of the composite measures or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown , 33 the low correlation between composite measures from different domains of care makes it difficult to identify high-performing hospitals , as well as to evaluate the construct validity of composite measures . <h> Shrinkage Estimators <p> When considering a particular performance measure calculated from all eligible patients at a facility ( or treated by a provider ) , one can not increase the precision of estimated performance by increasing the sample size . One can , however , modify the way in which estimated performance is calculated . Instead of relying on data from just the specific facility , one " borrows strength " by also considering performance in a set of facilities that can be assumed to be roughly similar to the specific facility . Consider a facility that is planning to implement a new program . Without any information about how well the program will work at the facility , one might well guess that the success rate will be the same as it is at other similar facilities that have implemented the program . But once the program has been implemented at the specific facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the facility-specific success rate and some on the success rate at other similar facilities . As more data become available at the specific facility , more weight will be placed on the facility-specific estimate and less weight on the estimate from other facilities . <p> This approach takes into account 3 main factors when attempting to estimate the " true " value of a performance measure at a facility : the overall value of the measure from all facilities ( considered to be the population value ) , the value of the measure at a specific facility , and the number of cases on which the specific facility experience is based . When estimating the " true " ( long-run ) value at a facility , less weight should be given to the population value and more weight to the value at the facility as the sample size increases . Or said another way , with a small sample size , the best guess of the " true " value at a facility is " pulled " or " shrunken " from the observed value at the facility toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size increases , there is less and less pulling or shrinkage away from the facility-specific value . These types of estimators are called shrinkage estimates ( or smoothed estimates ) 34 because they adjust for the greater uncertainty associated with smaller sample sizes . <p> Simple shrinkage estimators for a facility are calculated by taking a weighted average of the observed value of the measures at a facility and the overall values of the measures from all facilities . The weight w given to the observed value of a particular measure at a facility is larger when there are more cases for that measure at the facility ( the remaining weight 1-w is given to the value from all facilities ) . For a fixed sample size , when there is more variation in the performance measure across facilities , more weight is given to the facility-specific value and less to the population value ( since the population value is a less reliable measure of performance at any specific facility ) . Various authors have discussed the advantages of these types of estimates. 13 , 35-43 <p> A composite measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual measures rather than observed performance . The AHRQ PSI-90 Composite uses this approach. 10 In the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program , 44 CMS uses a sophisticated random effects model ( ie , a model that assumes that facility effects come from a common probability distribution ) that results in shrunken estimates of a hospital 's effect on readmission after adjusting for patient risk factors . The ratio of the hospital 's predicted readmission rate , given its case mix , to the expected readmission rate if there was no hospital effect is called the " risk-standardized readmission ratio " ( RSRR ) . To calculate an all-condition hospital-wide readmission measure ( ie , a readmission composite measure ) , CMS calculates RSRRs for 5 cohorts of patients ( comprising most hospital discharges ) , takes the log of the RSRRs ( because these types of ratios are skewed to the right ) , creates a composite using denominator-based weights , then exponentiates the result ( to get the composite back to a scale on the original units ) , and finally multiplies the exponentiated number by the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk-standardized hospital-wide readmission rate . <p> In more complex situations , shrinkage can depend not only on the relationship of a hospital-specific measure to the overall population average of that measure but also on the relationship between hospital-specific measures and population averages of other measures with which the particular measure is correlated . Shwartz and colleagues43 illustrated this using data on the 28 quality measures calculated from the Minimum Data Set ( derived from an assessment instrument used in nursing homes ) . When this is done , the estimate of the individual performance measure of interest is a composite measure ( ie , it is calculated by combining information about several different performance measures ) . This type of composite measure does not provide a more comprehensive view of performance , however , but can be a more precise view of performance on a single measure . <p> Birkmeyer , Dimick , Staiger , and colleagues have been in the forefront of advancing the use of these types of composite measures to better estimate a single performance measure. 42 , 45-47 To illustrate , in a 2009 paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve replacement ( AVR ) mortality that considered a number of hospital structural characteristics ( volume , teaching status , and nurse staffing levels ) , operative mortality ( death before discharge or within 30 days of surgery ) and nonfatal complications for AVR , and operative mortality and nonfatal complications for 7 other procedures . Their shrunken estimate of operative mortality for AVR at each hospital took into account both hospital-specific rates and overall population rates for AVR , the correlation of AVR with the other measures , and the reliability of each of the measures . The composite measure explained more of the variation in next year 's AVR mortality rates than did a shrunken measure of AVR mortality that did not include correlated variables ( 70% vs 32% ) . It also was better able to forecast differences in mortality across quintiles that were created based on this year 's AVR mortality rates . <p> Shrinkage estimators improve the precision of point estimates , particularly for smaller facilities whose observed performance levels are imprecise , and underscore that one is not able to learn much about small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from average . As Silber and colleagues48 pointed out , in some situations ( they use the example of AMI ) , it is known from the literature that facilities with lower volumes for certain procedures or conditions have a lower quality . In this case , shrinkage to an overall average can be misleading . As an alternative , smaller facilities can be shrunk toward a different target rate , for example , the average of all small facilities . This highlights the fact that on average , smaller facilities do not perform as well as larger facilities do on certain measures , but it may be unfair to the high-performing small facility that sees its estimated performance shrunk toward the lower average rate of all small facilities . How to handle estimates from small facilities therefore has been a matter of debate. 34 <p> Very little research with regard to profiling facilities or P4P programs has compared the use of composite measures with individual measures . Shwartz and colleagues33 demonstrated that hospitals that do best on a composite measure are often not among the best on most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes of care , readmissions , mortality , efficiency , and patient satisfaction ) from 577 hospitals . For each of the measures , each hospital was assigned to a quintile based on its performance on the measure . The composite measure was calculated as the sum of the quintiles . The top 5% of hospitals had a composite score of 9 or less . The top-ranked hospital ( sum of quintiles = 6 ) was in the first quintile on 4 of 5 measures and in the second quintile on the last . There seems little doubt that this hospital should be considered a high performer . Among the 7 hospitals for which the sum of the quintiles was 7 , there were 2 patterns : ( 1 ) the hospital was in the top quintile on 4 of 5 measures and in the third quintile on the fifth ; and ( 2 ) the hospital was in the top quintile on 3 measures and in the second quintile on the other 2 . These seem like reasonable patterns for a high-performing hospital . The situation is less clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum of the quintiles was 8 or 9 . Many of these hospitals were in the top quintile on only 2 of the 5 performance measures . One might be hesitant to call these hospitals high performers . The next 5% of sample hospitals had a sum of quintiles that equaled 10 , indicating that they were in the second quintile , on average , across all 5 measures . This pattern does not seem consistent with what one would expect for a high-performing hospital . <p> As part of an evaluation of a new performance measure ( the probability that a facility is in the top quintile ) using data from 28 quality measures from 112 VA nursing homes , Shwartz and colleagues23 compared how each facility would fare under a P4P program that rewarded each facility bonus payments based on its performance on individual measures versus bonus payments based on its performance on a composite measure . When allocations were based on a composite score , the payment bonuses ranged from 4.3% of the pool for the highest performers to almost nothing , but when allocations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonuses ranged from 1.7% of the pool to 0.3% . The facilities ranked the highest when using the composite score often were ranked much lower when rewards were based on performance on the individual measures . For example , of the 23 facilities receiving the largest bonuses based on the composite score , only 3 were in the top 23 based on individual score bonus payments ; 13 were ranked below the median . Overall , there was no relationship between the rankings based on the composite and the rankings based on the individual quality measures ( r = -0.11 , p = 0.25 ) . <p> Both of these examples suggest that composite measures are identifying certain types of facilities as high performers that would not be picked out by looking at just the individual measures comprising the composite . We suspect that composite measures are identifying as high performers some facilities that do " reasonably well " across most of the component measures but not " well enough " to be high performers on those measures . More research to examine this hypothesis would thus be useful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance measure scene , reflected in part by NQF 's evolving criteria for formal endorsement . Composite measures provide a useful summary of both current performance and improvement , but they must be used in conjunction with the component individual performance measures to find opportunities for improvement and to guide specific improvement activities . <p> As we explained , each of the approaches to developing composite measures has advantages and disadvantages . No one approach is clearly superior , and the impact of using one or another approach is likely to be dependent on the data set and the context in which the composite measure is being used . Also , there is much to learn about how different types of composites might differentially affect the behavior of key stakeholders , such as senior leaders of hospitals and health plans , payers , providers , researchers , and consumers/patients . <p> Recognizing the trade-offs necessary when selecting an approach and the gaps in knowledge , we offer the following conclusions : <p> Of the different approaches to aggregating facility-level measures , we prefer opportunity-based weights . They create equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composite and adjust for major case-mix differences across providers . <p> All-or-none approaches , which aggregate measures at the patient level , are most consistent with person-centered care and with a commitment to provide the highest levels of quality to each individual . <p> Weights based on the level of harm associated with the events being measured are desired by many users of composite measures , but to date , such weights have not been widely used because estimates of harm are based on expert judgment rather than explicit analyses . Given the need for harm-based weights , research in this area is likely to increase . <p> Reflective measures continue to be the mainstay of survey development , but as broad-based composite measures are increasingly implemented , the role of reflective measures is likely to diminish . <p> Five-star categorizations are easily communicated and reduce users cognitive burden . However , they can be unfair to facilities whose scores are near the category thresholds . Also , in a system in which individual measure scores are rolled up into increasingly broad hierarchies of composites , it is preferable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than on categories created at lower levels . <p> Shrinkage estimators are a useful way to stabilize or smooth estimates , either before creating composites or while creating composites , particularly when the size of the facilities varies greatly . But shrinkage estimators come at the cost of some loss in transparency . Moreover , when there is evidence linking quality to facility size , the target rates ( the rates to which estimates are shrunk ) for different sizes and types of facilities are controversial . <p> Our goal in this article was to describe the major issues associated with the creation and use of composite measures and to pull them together into one place . In Figure 1 , we highlight these issues and summarize our conclusions . A better understanding of both when and where to use composite measures and the effect of their use are certain to be important areas of research as the application of composite measures to assess providers performance increases . <h> Figure 1 . <p> Funding/Support : The work reported here was supported by the Jayne Koskinas and Ted Giovanis Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent Potential Conflicts of Interest .

This report reviews the quality of health care in the England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland , seeking to highlight best practices , and provides a series of targeted assessments and recommendations for further quality gains in health care . To secure continued quality gains , the four health systems will need to balance top-down approaches to quality management and bottom-up approaches to quality improvement ; publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , establish a forum where the key officials and clinical leaders from the four health systems responsible for quality of care can meet on a regular basis to learn from each others innovations . <p> This report is part of a series of publications reviewing the quality of health care across selected OECD countries . As health costs continue to climb , policy makers increasingly face the challenge of ensuring that substantial spending on health is delivering value for money . At the same time , concerns about patients occasionally receiving poor quality health care have led to demands for greater transparency and accountability . Despite this , there is still considerable uncertainty over which policies work best in delivering health care that is safe , effective and provides a good patient experience , and which quality-improvement strategies can help deliver the best care at the least cost . OECD Reviews of Health Care Quality seek to highlight and support the development of better policies to improve quality in health care , to help ensure that the substantial resources devoted to health are being used effectively in supporting people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems have much in common . They all offer population-wide insurance for the vast majority of health care needs , largely free at the point of use , through tax-funded single national pools . Similar values and service-models ( such as a strong primary care sector ) stem from a common heritage and evolution over the past 60 years . In addition , continuously improving the quality of care is a deeply established and widely shared commitment in all of the four systems . Each benefits from a bold and clear vision to achieve care that is consistently safe , effective and person-centred . The United Kingdoms drive to continuously strengthen quality assurance , monitoring and improvement means that it has pioneered , or implemented more widely and deeply than elsewhere , several tools and approaches to monitoring and improving health care quality . The United Kingdom has become a point of reference , for example , in the development of evidence-based clinical guidelines ; resources to support clinicians to stay up to date and engage in on-going professional development ; use of patient surveys and patient reported outcome measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reporting and learning from adverse events . <p> Health systems in the United Kingdom have , for many years , made the quality of care a highly visible priority , internationally pioneering many tools and policies to assure and improve the quality of care . Although each system has pursued distinct policy priorities under the leadership of the devolved administrations over recent years , the four still have much in common in terms of context and challenges . Key amongst these challenges is to understand why , despite being a global leader in quality monitoring and improvement , the United Kingdom does not consistently demonstrate strong performance on international benchmarks of quality . <p> The English NHS takes health care quality seriously and makes great effort to be a system that learns . England has internationally pioneered many initiatives , including clinical guidelines , continuing professional development and use of patient surveys and patient-reported outcomes . Professionalism was for many years the base upon which quality monitoring and improvement activities rested . Over time , though , the governance model shifted toward a quality management approach , more reliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national agencies , reviews and policies that address quality , leading to a somewhat congested and fragmented field of actors . This chapter recommends three key actions for England . First , greater emphasis on bottom-up approaches , led by patients and clinicians , should be encouraged . As the same time there is scope to simplify the range of institutions and policies regulating health care quality at national and local level . Finally , renewed focus on the quality at the interfaces of care , as well as on community-based services , is needed . <p> Scotland has set itself an ambitious quality agenda that strives to achieve health care that is consistently safe , effective and person-centred . This is underpinned by a bold public health vision that states that by 2020 , everyone will live longer , healthier lives at home . Scotland has demonstrated keenness to play an internationally leading role in promoting health care quality , as evidenced by its innovative patient safety initiatives , world-class training programmes , and a clear desire to learn from patients experience . Scotland is also taking steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local populations , and has an abundance of data to measure the progress in achieving health system and outcome goals . Paradoxically , health and social care data is not reliably converted into information that can be used by local clinicians and managers , nor oriented towards the public , often enough . This chapter gives a series of recommendations to support Scotland strengthening the health care quality architecture , including around making better use of information systems , facilitating transparency and reporting to the public , supporting bottom-up approaches with stronger national frameworks , and creating a more independent mechanism for assessing health system performance systemwide . <p> Less than two decades after devolution , the Welsh health system remains a relatively young one ; many of the institutions and mechanisms needed to promote high quality care are in place , but now a further push is needed to move towards a more mature , robust quality architecture . In many respects , " quality " is at the heart of the Welsh health system ; this chapter describes Wales already-rich health care quality architecture . The ambition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access and equity is clearly there in Wales , but now tangible practical steps are needed to make the necessary changes . This chapter makes a series of recommendations to support Wales in strengthening quality assurance and quality improvement . Assessment and recommendations are made across health system domains from the role of accreditation and standards , to patient voice and professional training . Cutting across these domains , the priority should now be for Wales should be looking to increase accountability for delivering good quality and improving quality , and trying to establish some more concrete levers for positive system change . <p> Northern Ireland has established a robust strategic agenda for quality of care , but faces a difficult challenge in maintaining public confidence amidst sustained economic pressures and ongoing concerns over access . While the small scale of the system promotes a culture of trust , it is over-burdened by a governance structure that may benefit from further consolidation . Amidst an array of grassroots initiatives there exists a need to further promote effective learning and sharing across services and scaling-up of good practices . More metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the regulator are indicated . The integration of health and social care governance has been poorly exploited to date , with funding and service arrangements still in silos and a lack of incentives to encourage change . Further integration and development of general practice as a principal agent for co-ordinating community responses to health and wellbeing needs will help drive reform . 
@@13586310 @2186310/ <h> Abstract <h> Background <p> Hospital readmissions are a leading topic of healthcare policy and practice reform because they are common , costly , and potentially avoidable events . Hospitals face the prospect of reduced or eliminated reimbursement for an increasing number of preventable readmissions under nationwide cost savings and quality improvement efforts . To meet the current changes and future expectations , organizations are looking for potential strategies to reduce readmissions . We undertook a systematic review of the literature to determine what factors are associated with preventable readmissions . <h> Methods <p> We conducted a review of the English language medicine , health , and health services research literature ( 2000 to 2009 ) for research studies dealing with unplanned , avoidable , preventable , or early readmissions . Each of these modifying terms was included in keyword searches of readmissions or rehospitalizations in Medline , ISI , CINAHL , The Cochrane Library , ProQuest Health Management , and PAIS International . Results were limited to US adult populations . <h> Results <p> The review included 37 studies with significant variation in index conditions , readmitting conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were most common , followed by all cause readmissions , other surgical procedures , and other specific-conditions . Patient-level indicators of general i 'll health or complexity were the commonly identified risk factors . While more than one study demonstrated preventable readmissions vary by hospital , identification of many specific organizational level characteristics was lacking . <h> Conclusions <p> The current literature on preventable readmissions in the US contains evidence from a variety of patient populations , geographical locations , healthcare settings , study designs , clinical and theoretical perspectives , and conditions . However , definitional variations , clear gaps , and methodological challenges limit translation of this literature into guidance for the operation and management of healthcare organizations . We recommend that those organizations that propose to reward reductions in preventable readmissions invest in additional research across multiple hospitals in order to fill this serious gap in knowledge of great potential value to payers , providers , and patients . <h> Introduction <p> Preventable hospital readmissions possess all the hallmark characteristics of healthcare events prime for intervention and reform . First , readmissions are costly : estimated at $17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at nearly $730 million for preventable conditions in four states within just six months 2 . Second , readmissions to the hospital within a relatively short span of time are common among the total population 3 , Medicare patients 1 , 4 , veterans 5 , and preterm infants 6 , underscoring the pervasiveness of the problem across hospitals . Third , disparities in readmission rates exist by race , ethnicity , and age 2 . Last , the idea of the unplanned , early , or preventable readmission is historically viewed as the result of quality shortcomings or system failures 7 . <p> As common , costly , and potentially avoidable events , it is not surprising that hospital readmissions are a leading topic of practice reform and healthcare policy . Payers in the US have explored readmission rates as measures of quality for decades 8 . Today , the Hospital Quality Alliance 9 , a consortium of payers , healthcare organizations , and regulators , includes readmission rates for select inpatient conditions as quality indicators , and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement 10 also promotes readmission rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Human services 11 provides selected readmission rates as part of Hospital Compare 's efforts to ' promote reporting on hospital quality of care ' and Thomson Reuters uses the measure in their annual 100 Top Hospitals List 12 . The Obama administration has identified reducing readmissions as a cost savings mechanism to finance reform efforts 13 . The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommended reducing payments for readmissions 14 and along with the National Quality Forum , has already defined some readmission as truly preventable and therefore not worthy of reimbursement 15 . Joining this call for reducing preventable readmissions is the growing interest in bundled payments and accountable care organizations as means to improve healthcare quality and efficiency . These approaches may reduce preventable readmissions by creating episodes of care , which encompass a significant portion of patients ' pre- and post-hospital care periods 16 . <p> However , for healthcare organizations , particularly hospitals and hospital systems , these changes and interest in readmissions are viewed as a harbinger of more uncompensated services and care 17 . To meet the current challenges and future expectations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , to reduce such preventable readmissions 18 . Aligning hospital operations and management practices with the desired goal of reduced preventable readmissions requires the identification of modifiable risk factors regarding patients and care . In light of these challenges , needs , and increasing pressure for a systemic response to preventable readmissions , we undertook a systematic review of the literature to determine how the existing literature defined preventable readmissions in terms of index condition , reasons for readmission , and timeframe , and what factors are associated with preventable readmissions . Without clear answers to these questions , valid and objective criteria for measuring preventable readmissions are likely to be in short supply and evidence-based strategies that might be used by providers to reduce such readmissions will be significantly delayed . <h> Conceptual framework <p> For the purposes of this review , we consider a preventable readmission as an unintended and undesired subsequent post-discharge hospitalization , where the probability is subject to the influence of multiple factors . Admittedly , the underlying possibility of prevention is quite variable across all the different events encompassed within this definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obvious errors . Despite this variance , this definition matches the focus of current reform efforts and research . Furthermore , this definition specifically excludes all index admissions , planned , or elective occurrences . <p> An adaptation of an existing health services research framework 19 helps organize and evaluate those factors reported in the literature as influencing preventable readmissions . Under this view , healthcare is the intersection of population health and medical care : the population perspective suggests outcomes are derived in part from individual characteristics as well as the qualities of their environment , whereas the clinical perspective adds the roles of the processes and structure of healthcare encounters . We use these perspectives to consider the preventable readmission determinants as operating within four levels ( Figure 1 ) . Patient characteristics include demographics , socioeconomic standing , behaviors , and disease states . The encounter level includes all activities and events associated with the delivery of care for the index hospitalization . The features of the organization that are not specific to a single encounter , but applicable to all encounters in the facility compose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual and the provider are included in the environmental level . In addition , we recognize this is a simplification of the preventable readmission phenomenon , second order determinants and interactions undoubtedly exist , but the complexity of those relationships is beyond the scope of this review . <p> Figure 1 <p> Conceptual model of the determinants of preventable readmissions . <h> Review methods <p> We undertook a systematic review to identify the factors associated with preventable readmissions following the suggested form of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) 20 . The search strategy is summarized in Figure 2 . <p> Figure 2 <p> Search strategy , exclusion and inclusion criteria . <h> Information sources and searching <p> We conducted a review of the English language medicine , health , and health services research literature for research studies dealing with unplanned , avoidable , preventable , or early readmissions . Each of these modifying terms was included in keyword searches of hospital readmission or readmission in Medline , ISI , CINAHL , The Cochrane Library , ProQuest Health Management , and PAIS International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major review by Benbassat and Taragin 3 covered the previous decade . Furthermore , we opted to limit our investigation to the English-language , US healthcare-based literature for the following reasons : while we anticipated patient-level or encounter characteristics would be consistent among other countries , the healthcare environments and organizational vary substantially from the US ; and underlying our interest are the relationships of preventable readmissions to US healthcare policy and payment structures . A detailed search strategy is included as Appendix 1 . Initial search results yielded 1,107 unduplicated records . <h> Study selection <p> Based on abstract information , we excluded from the initial search set : non-US based studies , studies of psychiatric patients or hospitals , editorials , practice guidelines , reviews , or instances where no indication existed the study was about preventable readmissions . Four members of the research team independently reviewed each record and then arrived at the excluded set through consensus . Our primary search and screening resulted in 153 articles for full text review . <p> The same four members of the research team independently read the full text of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved by consensus after a joint reading session . Articles were retained for inclusion in the review if they meet the following criteria : distinguished between all readmissions and those that were unplanned , early , avoidable , or preventable ; investigated potential risk factors or determinants of preventable readmission ; and did not combine other outcomes ( like mortality or emergency department admissions ) with readmissions into composite outcomes . In addition , we reassessed each article according to our previous exclusion criteria . We did not restrict inclusion according to study design . A total of 40 articles met the inclusion criteria after full text review . <p> Of the 40 articles , three were studies of infant hospitalizations . At this point we determined to exclude these three articles from the review for the following reasons : because infant hospitalizations and surgical procedures are qualitatively different than adult admissions , we thought it would be difficult to combine the two populations in order to make general conclusions or that any contrasts might be artificial ; the opportunity to identify patient behaviors and characteristics for intervention is markedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others for healthcare decisions ; our strategy found so few studies of infants we believed there was not sufficient material for analysis ; and , given the limited number , we were concerned our search strategy was biased against finding infant hospitalization studies ( we did not specifically include terms that may have found more infant based studies ) . Therefore , we opted to exclude studies of children and infants . Our final review included 37 studies , all among adult populations . <h> Data collection <p> From each included article , we abstracted the study design , population , setting , type of readmission identified by the authors ( unplanned , early , potentially preventable , et al. ) , index condition , the operationalization of readmission ( timeframe and cause ) , and identified risk factors by level . In addition , we noted any models or reasoning that tied the index condition to the readmission , methods to guard against lost to follow-up or selection bias , and statistical methods . <h> Assessment <p> As a means of summarizing the quality of the article and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each article according to the presence or absence of three criteria covering the areas of conceptualization , patient linkage , and analysis . Under conceptualization , we looked for studies that explicitly provided a biological , medical , or theoretical model or reasoning tying the index condition to the readmission condition . The presence of such a model , which obviously could take different forms , strengthened the assumption of an underlying probability of preventability of the readmitting condition . While readmissions for the same condition were considered as fulfilling this criterion , post-hoc reasoning of results or implicit assumptions of relationships did not . Second , a significant concern in any readmission study is the potential for patients ' subsequent admissions to be with another facility . We considered studies that detailed a method to guard against attrition or selection bias as possessing an adequate patient linkage strategy to address these concerns . We looked for the reported strategies to follow or contact patients post-discharge , or the use of shared statewide databases . Finally , we noted articles that made use of multivariate statistics to control for potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a potential bias . <p> According to our assessment strategy , the potential for bias is mixed . Nine of the studies meet all three of our quality criteria 22 , 23 , 25 " 27 , 31 , 34 , 45 , 47 . However , the same number of studies possessed only one or none of the desired characteristics 24 , 33 , 37 , 39 , 50 , 52 " 55 . While the most frequently absent criterion was an explicit conceptual linkage between the index and readmitting condition , most studies meet this requirement by simply limiting the reason for readmission to the same or related diagnosis during the index admission 21 , 23 " 29 , 31 , 34 " 36 , 42 , 47 , 49 " 51 . A handful of studies were able to considered more disparate readmission reasons as preventable by applying accepted definitions of preventable conditions 2 , 25 , 43 , specifying the phenomena driving readmission 44 , 45 , detailing a clinical link 26 , or outlining a full conceptual model 22 . <p> Inadequate designs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subsequent readmissions over time and across locations occurred in only 10 studies 21 , 24 , 28 , 29 , 39 , 42 , 50 " 52 , 55 . These tended to be single site , or narrowly defined geographical area studies . The single site and smaller studies that meet this criterion reported the use of post-discharge interviews , contacts with family , telephone calls , or physician interviews to improve patient tracking 30 , 33 , 36 , 38 , 44 " 46 , 48 . The use of already linked , shared statewide inpatient databases or large nationwide files such as Medicare helps alleviate concerns that subsequent admissions may have been lost to follow-up . <p> Confounding and statistical conclusion validity were likely problems in a significant percentage of the studies . In terms of confounding , 14 of the 37 included studies did not analyze their data with multivariate methods 2 , 24 , 33 , 35 " 37 , 43 , 44 , 49 , 50 , 52 " 55 . Even among those that did use multivariate methods , not all modeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 . However , several studies either utilized methods appropriate to the clustered nature of the hospital discharges 23 , or analyzes stratified by organization 26 , 35 . <p> Finally , although generalizablity was not one of our formal assessment criteria , it bears mentioning . Due to our selection criteria , none of these studies are generalizable to children . In addition , several studies were of very restricted age ranges 41 , 45 , 53 , 55 , with those using Medicare data as the most obvious 5 , 22 , 32 , 40 . The restricted age ranges of the Medicare-based studies limits the generalizablity of results , even though these studies had nationwide populations . Also in terms of geography , not all states were represented and more than one state 's databases or population were examined on multiple occasions ( e.g. , New York 2 , 27 , 31 , 35 , 43 , California 25 , 31 , 39 , and Pennsylvania 2 , 23 , 41 ) . <h> How has the existing literature defined preventable hospitalizations ? <p> Table 1 summarizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the term employed by the authors . As evident , variation triumphs over consistency . For example , among the 16 studies that purported to study early readmissions , there are 15 different combinations of index conditions , readmitting conditions , and timeframes . Although 30 days post-discharge was the most popular choice of time until readmission , it is only one of 16 different timeframes examined and the reason for the selected timeframe was often not provided . Terms frequently are used in combination or as synonyms and different terms are used to describe similar relationships between index and readmitting conditions . For example , two studies described readmitting conditions that can be reasonably assumed to be related to the index admission as potentially preventable 26 , 31 . At the same time , several studies also examined readmissions for the same condition or complications , but called them early readmissions 21 , 23 , 27 " 29 , 47 , 50 or unplanned readmissions 24 , 34 , or unplanned related readmissions 36 . Further complicating matters , seven additional studies also used the term early readmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index and readmission 30 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 46 , 48 , 55 . <p> Table 1 <p> Variation terms , definitions , and timeframes in preventable readmission research <p> However , a few studies provided a careful explanation or justification for relating choice of terminology , index conditions , and readmitting condition . While being thorough , they also used different approaches . For example , Goldfield et al . 26 identified five clinically relevant criteria to establish clinically related readmissions : same condition , clinical plausible decompensation , plausibly related to care during index , readmission for a surgical procedure related to index condition , or readmission for surgical procedure for a complication from index . This approach is notable : because it is based on all patient-refined , diagnosis-related groups ( APR DRGs ) and secondary discharge data , it could be applied by individual hospitals . Also using secondary data , Garcia et al . 25 defined potentially avoidable rehospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) based on published ambulatory care-sensitive condition definitions . This approach draws on a large literature-base legitimizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different approach , in a small clinical study of cardiac surgery patients , Kumbhani et al . 34 provided the fairly straightforward and defensible definition for unplanned readmissions as complications resulting from surgery . However , this definition and others like it are more difficult to apply again in other settings , because they rely on clinical judgment and not a reported list of specific diagnostic codes . That is not to say the judgments were incorrect or any less valid , just more difficult to replicate . <h> What factors in the literature are associated with preventable patient readmissions ? <p> Given the inconsistent application of terminology , we did not attempt to stratify results by terminology or timeframe for readmission ( i.e. , early , unplanned , preventable , et al . ) . However , because the etiology of readmissions may vary by index condition or procedure , we stratified the index and readmission conditions into four groups for convenience : any or non-condition specific readmissions , cardiovascular-related , other surgical procedures , and all other conditions . <h> Any or non-condition specific readmissions <p> Nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 45 , 53 " 55 included index admissions for any cause followed by any cause readmission . In addition , two studies 2 , 26 defined multiple index and readmitting conditions , but did not stratify analyses by condition thereby presenting overall summary measures of association . The studies are summarized in Table 2 . All of these studies predominately examined patient-level factors , and the primary predictor or possible risk factor for preventable readmission is simply general i 'll health . This theme appears whether formally measured on the Charlson 30 , 44 or Elixhauser scales 5 , reported as worsening of index conditions 53 , 54 , poor self-rated health 44 , unmet functional needs 22 , or just by the presence of significant chronic conditions 39 , 55 . Potentially measuring the same underlying patient status , more than one study identified an association between frequent or increased use of the healthcare system and preventable readmission 5 , 30 , 44 as well as increasing or elderly age 5 , 26 , 53 . In addition , Arbaje et al . 22 reported patients who lived alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early readmission . <p> Table 2 <p> Studies of preventable readmissions with any cause index admission followed by any cause readmission among adults , United States , 2000-2009 <p> * All exclusion criteria or specific diagnostic codes not reported - see original article for additional details . <p> ** Study did not compare readmissions with non-readmissions so factors are from descriptive statistics/reports only <p> Explicitly specified a biological , theoretical or conceptual model linking the readmission condition to the index condition ( includes readmissions for same condition ) <p> Specified a strategy or research design to guard against loss to follow up <p> - Used multivariate statistics <p> Modeling technique did not account of non-independence of observations in analysis <p> AHRQ = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality <p> VA = Veterans ' Affairs <p> ADLs = Activities of daily living <p> Studies of any cause index admission and readmissions limited examination of the encounter level to a few general factors . Four studies reported an association between increasing length of stay during the index hospitalization and readmission 5 , 22 , 30 , 44 . Also , patients who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 30 , 44 , or who were self-payers 2 , 30 were reportedly more likely for readmission than those with private insurance . Finally , in a univariate analysis , Novonty and Anderson 44 reported discharge to home healthcare or to another healthcare facility were associated with early readmissions . <p> The organizational and environmental levels received even less attention . Weeks et al . ' 5 study of urban and rural veterans was the only study in the entire review to consider patient , encounter , organizational , and environmental level factors . In terms of the environment , they reported rural veterans had higher odds of unplanned readmissions . For the organizational level , they also reported if the site of index admission was a VA hospital , the odds of readmission were higher . However , the modeling approach did n't account for within-site clustering . Although through a different approach , Goldfield et al . 26 also demonstrated that at an overall level , some characteristic of the index hospital matters , as readmission rates varied greatly between facilities . Finally , the research by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assistance . In her study , patients ' with higher levels of social support were less likely to be readmitted early . <h> Cardiovascular-related index admissions and readmissions <p> Thirteen studies considered readmission where the index condition was AMI 25 , heart failure 21 , 28 , 29 , 32 , 35 , 47 , 50 , coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery 27 , 48 , cardiac surgery 34 , 46 , or pulmonary embolism 23 . ( See Table 3 . ) On patient characteristics , the above studies were consistent on the increased risk of early , unplanned , or avoidable readmissions for patients with : existing heart disease 25 , 27 , 32 , diabetes 27 , 32 , 46 , 48 , COPD 27 , 29 , 46 , renal dysfunction/failure 32 , 46 , other complex co-morbid conditions 27 , 32 , and higher patient severity scores 23 , 34 . In terms of gender , women were more likely to be readmitted early for a cardiac-related cause after acutely decompensated heart failure 47 , or for complications related to CABG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery 46 . In contrast , Harja et al . 29 reported among heart failure and shock patients , men were more likely to be readmitted early with a diagnosis of heart failure than women . Only Hannan et al . 27 reported increasing age was associated with readmission and only Aujesky et al . 23 found African American patients were more likely than White patients to be readmitted early after pulmonary embolism . <p> Table 3 <p> Studies of preventable readmissions of cardiovascular-related index admissions and readmissions among adults , United States , 2000-2009 <p> * All exclusion criteria or specific diagnostic codes not reported - see original article for additional details . <p> Explicitly specified a biological , theoretical or conceptual model linking the readmission condition to the index condition ( includes readmissions for same condition ) <p> Specified a strategy or research design to guard against loss to follow up <p> - Used multivariate statistics <p> Modeling technique did not account of non-independence of observations in analysis <p> Both the risk of potentially avoidable AMI-related readmissions 25 , and early readmission for after pulmonary embolism 23 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was higher for patients discharged home with supplementary care 23 , to skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility 27 , or who left hospital against medical advice 23 . Increasing length of stay was a risk factor for early heart disease readmissions after acutely decompensated heart failure 47 and for 30-day readmits for CABG complications 27 . However , Kumbhani et al . 34 recently reported unplanned readmission related to complications of cardiac surgery were more likely for patients with a length of stay fewer than six days . While these general findings are similar to the studies of any cause readmissions , the studies of the cardiovascular-related group were able to go into more detail . For example , Garc+a et al . 25 report the risk of AMI-related readmissions decreases when CABGs were performed on admission , and Kumbhani et al . 34 found a myocardial tissue pH &lt; 6.85 at the end of the bypass increased the odds of 30-day readmission more than six-fold . Finally and particularly noteworthy , is the increased risk of early readmission due to complications of CABG surgery when the procedure was performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannan et al . 27 . This was the only study to examine a characteristic of the individual provider associated with the index admission . <p> Again , organizational and environmental level factors were explored infrequently . As a global measure , Lagoe et al . 35 found unplanned readmissions for congestive heart failure varied by hospital in Syracuse , NY . This tends to suggest organizational characteristics matter in cardiovascular-related preventable readmissions , but care must be taken in interpreting organizational level findings as no risk or case mix adjustment was reported . In support of this conclusion , Keenan et al . 32 employed among the most sophisticated modeling techniques in the review to account for clustering and different patient mixes . However , because they did not examine any organizational level factors , the reported variance in the hospital specific intercepts again only suggests some organization factors are at play . More specific factors were examined by Aujesky et al . 23 , who found 30-day readmissions were higher for teaching hospitals and for hospitals located in particular parts of the state . While these authors did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site-specific analyses to look for specific variation in their models . Additionally , in their study of readmissions due to complications of CABG surgery , Hannan et al . 27 modeled the higher level determinants like hospital risk adjusted mortality rates , but the study relied on ordinary logistic regression violating independence assumptions . At the environmental level , Ferraris et al . 46 reported the patient 's zip code was associated with unplanned readmissions . However , because the authors used ordinary logistic regression , the statistical significance may be solely due to underestimated standard errors . <h> Surgical procedures <p> Table 4 summarizes five studies that examined preventable readmissions after colorectal or lower intestinal surgeries 24 , 33 , 36 " 38 , the two after any type of surgical procedure 42 , 43 and one study on pancreatic surgery among cancer patients 40 . Results for this group are a little sparse , however , as three employed only univariate statistics 33 , 37 , 43 and two found no statistically significant factors 24 , 36 . Still , a few factors are repeatedly identified within this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readmissions after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 38 and pancreatic resection surgeries 40 .

The odds of early readmission after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis were higher for laparoscopic approach , synchronous protocolectomy , or postoperative blood transfusion 38 . Finally , Scott et al . 42 reported numerous factors associated with early readmissions due to infections . <h> Other conditions <p> The final five studies , displayed in Table 5 , cover the diverse index conditions of diabetes 31 , 41 , pneumonia 51 , traumatic brain injury 49 , and cancer 52 . Among diabetics , both studies indicated a greater risk of potentially preventable 31 or unplanned 41 readmissions for African Americans , but present conflicting results for Hispanics . Furthermore , in Robbins and Webb 's 41 large cohort , they also identified increasing age , severity class , previous utilization , increasing length of stay , and discharge to other institutions or home health as risk factors . El Solh et al . 51 examined unplanned pneumonia readmissions among the elderly , and was one of the few studies to include measures of patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Weaver et al . 52 concluded that inadequate care giver support was more common among unplanned readmissions . Finally , related to the possibility of support for high-risk patients outside the acute care setting , traumatic brain injury patients who lived in private residences were less likely to be readmitted for non-elective reasons . <p> Table 5 <p> Studies of preventable readmissions for other conditions among adults , United States , 2000-2009 <p> * All exclusion criteria or specific diagnostic codes not reported - see original article for additional details . <p> Explicitly specified a biological , theoretical or conceptual model linking the readmission condition to the index condition ( includes readmissions for same condition ) <p> Specified a strategy or research design to guard against loss to follow up <p> - Used multivariate statistics <p> NIDRR = National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research <h> Discussion <p> The current literature on preventable readmissions in the US contains evidence from a variety of populations , locations , settings , designs , and conditions . If a single common set of consistent patient-level risk factors can be distilled from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or frailty : co-morbidities 5 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 32 , 38 " 40 , 44 , 46 , 55 , increasing severity class 23 , 34 , 41 , increasing age 5 , 26 , 27 , 41 , 53 , general poor health 44 , 53 , 54 , or high previous utilization of the healthcare system 5 , 29 , 30 , 41 , 44 . In addition , some studies highlighted racial/ethnic disparities in preventable readmission for diabetics 31 , 41 , patients with pulmonary embolism 23 , and other preventable conditions 2 . However , these potential risk factors are common to other investigations of hospitalization . In Jencks et al . 1 recent examination of rehospitalizations ( where they make no claim to preventability ) , they identified similar indicators of patient ill-health and disparities by race , socio-economic status , and geography . Other types of healthcare utilization show similar patterns : disparities according to race/ethnicity 56 and risks based on age 57 for hospitalizations due to ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations , and those with poor health are more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The combined results of encounter level factors run along similar lines . Across multiple conditions , encounters covered by Medicaid 2 , 23 , 25 , 30 , 44 or self-pay 2 , 30 were indicators of increased odds of subsequent preventable readmissions ; these are again probably proxies for either socio-economic status or access to primary care issues . In addition , while length of stay is encounter-specific and identified as an associated factor in multiple studies 5 , 22 , 27 , 30 , 41 , 44 , 47 , it may in part reflect underlying patient health 59 . The same may be true for those studies that indicated discharge to some other care facility or supplemental care were associated with readmission 23 , 27 , 44 . <p> Intuitively and from a few studies in this review , we know that the admitting hospital may make a difference on subsequent readmissions . We can not definitively say why or how . We do not know if the admitting hospital actually exerts some effect ( through structures , policies , and procedures ) , or if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies documented that hospitals are different 23 , 26 , 30 , 32 , 35 , but very few looked for organizational-level factors . Even when organizational factors are explicitly examined , we are still uncertain about the magnitude or validity of the effect because statistical assumptions were violated 5 , 27 . <p> In similar fashion , the results of factors at the environment level are , on balance , more suggestive than informative at this point . Living in a private residence 49 , difficulty in getting care givers 52 , or lack of social support 45 are really features of the patient 's environment . However , only the study by Schwarz 45 used multivariate statics , theoretically linked the index and readmission , and ensured adequate patient follow-up . Even then , the study focused on a small , narrowly defined population . Ferraris et al . 46 found a patient 's zip code associated with unplanned readmissions , but knowing what these results means is obscured because we know nothing about the resources or socioeconomics of the areas , and the modeling fails to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ferraris et al . were asserting that the environment has an effect . Likewise , Weeks et al . 5 found effects for rural residence . The result is intriguing , but the questions about the underlying mechanism accounting for the risk it raises are more logically answered by features of the environment : is it access to specialists , primary care , or rehabilitation and preventative services ? While residence could be considered a patient-level variable , we would argue that rurality is more about the patients ' context , and less about their own characteristics and behaviors . <p> The current research is missing in-depth examinations of more than one aspect of preventable readmissions . While it is fairly clear that patients with markers of general poor health are more likely to come back to the hospital , our knowledge about encounter-level factors is predominately related to length of stay and payer . Variance in the former depends substantially upon condition , and the latter is confounded by socioeconomic status , access , and a host of other factors . Few studies ventured to examine organizational and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed . All multi-facility investigations using large databases could easily incorporate organizational level factors and utilize random effects or other cluster adjustments . The now more widespread appreciation of statistical methods for handling clustered data and improved computer power means the more sophisticated statistical methods utilized by a few studies in this review can be replicated . Furthermore , numerous structural and performance measures are available from existing surveys . Additionally , factors measured at the zip code level , like poverty or availability of primary care , are easily attainable and provide information on neighborhood effects and area resources . Again , these factors can be incorporated into models given the appropriate choice of statistical technique . <h> Variance in definitions makes drawing on the existing literature difficult <p> This paper has focused on preventable readmissions , but this is a term of convenience because the underlying possibility of prevention is variable across different readmissions . Unfortunately , it is frequently difficult to decide just how preventable the readmissions truly are due to numerous timeframes , the pervasive lack of conceptual clarity , and the varying use of terminology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for a clear , shared vocabulary ; for the choice of term makes a difference , as it not only indicates the degree to which the readmission is preventable , but also suggests by what mechanism prevention may be achieved . <p> This review contributes to that effort as some of the studies reviewed make strong efforts at conceptual and definitional clarity . From those studies , we can start to apply some common definitions and order to these terms . First , the term ' early ' stresses the temporal association between the index and subsequent admissions . However , causality is not definite , because both elective and non-elective readmissions can occur shortly after discharge 8 . ' Unplanned or non-elective ' readmissions are not scheduled occurrences part of the medical process and undesired returns to the hospital 24 , 41 . These labels are more descriptive and restrictive than simply ' early ' because they eliminate some obviously non-preventable readmissions from consideration . Additionally , the word ' unplanned ' sounds more like an aberrant event in the medical intervention initiated at the hospital , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalization . Finally , two terms clearly indicate a belief that intervention could effectively reduce the probability of readmission and employ more causal-type language . ' Potentially avoidable ' draws upon the language of ambulatory care sensitive conditions , signifying appropriate , quality primary care can prevent readmission 25 . By utilizing this established literature base , this label indicates a general strategy to reduce readmissions by improving the quality of , and access to , post-discharge care and patient management . ' Potentially preventable ' was used by Goldfield et al . 26 to describe clinically related , needless readmissions that quality care , discharge planning , follow up , or improved coordination would avert ; this terminology not only claims a high expectation of preventability , but also implies broader opportunities for intervention inside and outside the hospital . Descriptions of readmissions adhering to the above terms and concepts would greatly facilitate comparisons between studies and simplify the national conversation on reform . <h> Methodological challenges make applying the existing literature to local practice difficult <p> Researchers , administrators , and clinicians have over many years pursued identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervening to extend or support a patient 's care after discharge . While this review identified some consistent factors for such a model , it also catalogued a great deal of variety . For every reasonably consistent factor , like increasing co-morbidity scores , older age , or race/ethnicity disparities , there appeared to be multiple , detailed factors specific to the index and readmitting condition , like type of cardiovascular treatments , intraoperative measurements , surgical approaches , or specific existing conditions . This suggests a statistical model of just preventable readmissions may prove to be too elusive and that we should focus on condition specific preventable readmissions , either through stratified models or categorical dependent variables . While more complicated , that approach may prove more effective . Studies that do not restrict analysis to a single set of clinically-related index and readmitting conditions are most likely limited to effectively modeling only general risk factors , because the distinctive risks for various conditions may be may be lost in , or overpowered by , variables that apply to all conditions . Unfortunately , it is probably the condition-specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital and in post-discharge settings . However , as much of the organizational and environmental factors are yet untapped , more information in the future may allow the question to be reexamined . <p> Four practical methodological challenges also hinder application of results in local practice . First , the studies in this review included both analyses of secondary linked datasets and those that relied on primary data collection and chart review . There is a difficulty in rectifying these two methods . Because primary data collection allows for many more detailed factors that may not be available in administrative databases , some findings may not be able to be utilized by those working in secondary data . In addition , the large sample sizes of the linked datasets may have indentified factors that will not be detectable in single-site studies . If it takes statewide or nationwide databases to identify statistically significant predictors because their effects are so small , it is difficult to assume any single facility will be able to generate the same level of precision in their own models . This is particularly true if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific condition or procedure . Third , the ability to adequately identify patients ' previous and subsequent admissions may be very difficult for some facilities . The majority of studies relied on linked databases to ensure that all admissions to other facilities were being captured . Otherwise , extensive primary data collection was required . If facilities opt not to invest in primary data collection and patient follow-up , the ability of any single organization to identify their facility-specific risk factors for preventable readmissions may have to wait for fully developed local heath information exchange to follow patients between providers . Alternatively , the agency responsible for aggregating discharge claims within each state may have to take on the burden of patient matching . Finally , while in this review we have already advocated for more appropriate statistical techniques to account for the clustered nature of readmission , we recognize this type of modeling is not easy . Random-effects modeling requires expertise , specialized software , and sufficient computing power . Some organizations , like academic medical centers or VA facilities with access to health service research postdoctoral fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictive modeling . For other organizations , these approaches may be beyond their in-house capabilities . <h> Strategies for hospitals <p> If the conventional wisdom is to be believed , the cost of preventable readmissions will be borne principally by hospitals . However , as suggested in the introduction and as the existing literature has borne out , preventable readmissions are influenced by factors at the patient , encounter , organizational , and environmental levels . Which of these factors are actually in the hospitals ' control or even amenable to direct influence ? <p> Obviously , individual patient characteristics require significant consideration for those planning any interventions . It is an interesting contradiction that patient-level characteristics were the dominant area of inquiry for the reviewed studies , but most of these characteristics seem to be out of the hospitals ' direct control . As O'Brien noted , ' unfortunately , many of these patient characteristics can not be altered ' 37 p2142 ; a somewhat fatalistic comment , suggesting that research will need to increasingly identify behaviors and or contexts that can be targeted by interventions and evaluations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients discharged against medical advice 23 , 41 does not particularly bode well for any ideas that the hospital will be able to effectively influence subsequent health behaviors or even monitor resource utilization 50 . However , more than one study in the earlier review by Benbassat and Taragin 3 found interventions to provide post-discharge support or assistance reduced readmissions , and more recently , some systems such as Geisinger 60 report success with patient-follow up after discharge . <p> Several encounter-level risk factors identified in this review , particularly those pertaining to specific procedures and medical interventions , are changeable by hospitals . In fact , the reviewed literature makes a few explicit recommendations , but these changes or improvements to clinical care while in the hospital are very condition-specific 21 , 34 , 43 , 47 , 50 , 51 . The fact that there are so few specific recommendations for providers of care is not surprising because much of the literature was admittedly focused primarily on measurement methods 26 , 30 , 32 , 35 , 39 , 44 and policy issues broader than intra-hospital operations 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond the few clinically-specific recommendations , the bulk of the remaining encounter-level risk factors hospitals either actually can not change ( such as who pays for the encounter or if the patient leaves against medical advice ) or a simple , all-encompassing recommendation that is much more difficult ( as in the case of length of stay , which is subject to a host of condition-specific clinical and payer influences ) . Similarly , hospitals may have limited or no effect on the supply or quality of primary care providers or home health , rehabilitation , or skilled nursing programs or facilities that may impact readmissions . <p> As deterministic actors , hospitals can make changes to their structure and processes and push back against environmental forces . Although hospitals can clearly change themselves and at least try to change the environment of their patients , the existing literature gives little guidance . As noted , the reviewed studies did not identify any organizational-level factors that can be easily targeted for change . Environmental-level determinants were also infrequently examined , but at least there we have some ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' immediate support network . For example , Weaver et al . 52 advised coordination with social workers or case managers during the discharge of cancer patients , and Timms et al . 55 advocated for more qualitative information gathering through interviews with the patients , family members , and caregivers about the needs of elderly patients . These recommendations can be empirically tested in highly variable settings by multi-hospital systems or independent hospitals working on a joint program of research using quasi-experimental designs . <p> So what should hospitals do ? Multiple options are available , but the choice of approach , in part , reflects the organization 's underlying assumptions about the causes of readmissions , the applicability of predictive models , and the forthcoming financial policies . One viewpoint is that preventable readmissions are clearly a measure of overall hospital quality and that all preventable readmissions , regardless of causes , have some underlying driving factors 1 " 3 , 5 , 7 " 11 , 26 , 32 , 41 . While this view would allow for statistical modeling as an effective means of performance measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for individual risk factors or single interventions is too narrow in scope . If one accepts that preventable readmissions are failures at multiple processes , levels , and structures of healthcare , then these readmissions stand as a global indicator , not a single data point the organization tries to move ; the potential changes in reimbursement are not intended to change a targeted practice or behavior , but to spur overall quality . That viewpoint suggests the solution to preventable readmissions is improvement in overall quality . That is definitely a hospital-centric view , where the efforts of the hospital are paramount in affecting preventable readmissions . In support of this view is that evidence indicates some hospitals are both better than expected and better than their peers in terms preventable readmission rates 26 . Maybe these are the higher quality hospitals , or simply those who care for patients with lower severity conditions , or are located near more higher quality primary care and post-discharge care providers . For those organizations performing poorly on preventable readmissions , the implication is the need for organization-wide transformation . Transformation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a profound change in the entire organization 's culture and processes that improves quality 61 " 64 . Unfortunately , the transformation in healthcare organizations has not been easily or widely achieved 65 . <p> A second general viewpoint is that preventable readmissions are not about the quality of care 33 , 36 . Preventable readmissions are more about the person receiving care 24 , 29 , 44 " 46 , 48 , 55 and the viewpoint is marked by phrases like ' unpredictable sequel ' 33 and ' can not be predicted ' 24 , 36 . While not as dismissive of preventable readmissions as a marker of quality as the preceding quotations , those focusing on patients ' post-discharge experiences , contexts , and resources 2 , 22 , 25 , 31 , 52 , 66 could also be considered as sharing this extra-hospital viewpoint . This view is in stark contrast to the hospital-centric viewpoint , because whether preventable readmissions occur from pre-existing co-morbidities , health behaviors , or access to primary care , these things are all beyond the scope of services provided by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair financial penalty 67 that hospitals try to avoid through various targeted initiatives like improved information systems 18 , case managers 52 , and post-discharges follow up 60 . The underlying theme of these approaches and this extra-hospital view is that patients in some fashion have to be actively managed , because the negative financial outcomes are too great to take a passive role . For example , Ferraris et al . 46 offered a practical , but an admittedly untested solution to the risk posed by patient co-morbidities : treat co-morbidities that raise the risk of readmission preoperatively . While intuitively a logical approach , this suggestion is more plausible under certain scenarios than others . A sufficient structure has to be in place to deliver that treatment . In case of infections , that care can exist within the hospital , but for chronic conditions , hospitals would need to possess an ambulatory care service line or have a strong connection to ambulatory care providers . <p> The concern over factors not modifiable by the hospital and the perceived need for continued , active post-discharge management are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , the push toward accountable care organizations . Through vertical integration , integrated delivery systems are ( theoretically ) poised to facilitate transitions between different levels of care , and the care between inpatient , outpatient , and ambulatory care are better aligned . Accountable care organizations are to achieve the same alignment of effort toward the care of a population of patients 68 . Becoming an integrated delivery system is not exactly a fast or necessarily feasible response . Accountable care organizations function under a variety of structures , possibly tied together only through a joint financial arrangement like a bundled payment or shared information system , which is at least somewhat more feasible to develop . Alternatively , those with the extra-hospital view will undoubtedly continue to look for more effective interventions for patients they rarely see . <h> Limitations <p> First , as is the case with all reviews , even though we searched six databases for this review it is possible we omitted some studies . One of the included databases does include grey literature , but we would assume that is the source area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we were not attempting to quantify any effect sizes , this deficit probably does not dramatically alter any of our conclusions . Second , because we are concerned with the effects of organization and environment as well as the individual- and encounter-level determinants of readmissions , we limited our investigation to US based studies . However , significant and high quality work in defining and modeling predictive readmissions has been done internationally . A cursory look at this literature concurs with our earlier assumption of consistency of patient-level and encounter characteristics internationally . For example , older age 69 , 70 , i 'll health 70 , 71 , longer length of stays 71 , and prior utilization 69 , 71 also appear as risks in other countries . Although potentially technically challenging , cross-national comparisons may prove to be very informative . <h> Summary <p> Despite the fact it is not always clear what is meant by a preventable ( or even an early , unplanned , or avoidable ) readmission , these unwanted events are not completely random occurrences . Multiple studies in various populations and with different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that patients with generally worse health and greater frailty are more likely to be readmitted . However , this does not point the way to a single intervention . Furthermore , these readmissions are likely to be the target of healthcare finance reform because , regardless of definitions , methodologies exist to identify hospitals that vary according to this indicator . Unfortunately , the current identification of aberrant performance does not provide direction on how to reduce their occurrence . How hospitals will respond to these changes in reimbursement will likely be related to where they believe the problems originate within or without their own walls . Certainly , policy makers , payers , and providers ( not to mention patients ) have a significant stake in increased knowledge of preventable readmissions and in identification of strategies that can best reduce such occurrences . We recommend increased support for research that can address these issues . With the significantly increased focus on information technology , medical homes , and accountable care organizations , we recommend support for applied research that can provide more immediate knowledge of factors that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that both builds on understanding of the variability and gaps in current research and relies on conceptual and statistical models that begin to address the tremendous complexity of the preventable readmission . <h> Authors ' Information <p> JV was at the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health during part of the preparation of this manuscript .

After adjusting for other factors those living in the most urban areas were more likely to have seen a specialist physician .

Universal health insurance coverage has eliminated many barriers to receiving appropriate , high quality health care , however geography remains a potential barrier to access . <p> Considering the attention that is placed on access to health care services it is surprising the degree of ambiguity in defining it . In the United States access is often synonymous with health insurance . This implies that once everyone has insurance there will be some degree of equality in the utilization of health care services . How , then is access defined in an environment , such as Canada , where everyone has health insurance ? The Canada Health Act ( CHA ) lists access as one of its five main tenants stating that " persons must have reasonable and uniform access to insured health services , free of financial or other barriers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such factors as income , age , and health status 1 . " While there is general agreement about the value of this principle , there is a great deal of national discourse about how this should be interpreted , applied , and evaluated 2 " 4 . <p> Andersen has operationalized a definition of access to be used in health services research . He states that access is " the actual use of personal health services and everything that facilitates or impedes the use of personal health services 5 . " In this definition , access consists of two components " the use of health services " and " everything that facilitates or impedes the use . " It is this definition on which the Health Behaviour Model , the conceptual framework for this study is based . <p> An important concept in the evaluation of access is equity . Health care services are equitably distributed when health status and demographic indicators of health status are the strongest predictors of who uses health care 6 . When evaluating the degree of equity , indicators of need are considered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal utilization rates ( horizontal equity ) and those with less need will have lower utilization rates ( vertical equity ) 7 . <p> Intuitively it is expected that rural populations have reduced access to health care services compared to urban populations . However studies comparing access of rural and urban populations have been contradictory and inconclusive . Whether or not differences between rural and urban populations are observed depends on the measure of access that is assessed , how rural-urban status is classified , and what other factors , such as geographic location beyond rural-urban , are taken in to account 8 . <p> Many of the studies that compare access variables between rural and urban communities , use a dichotomous variable for rural-urban . This does not account for varying degrees of rurality of communities . Studies that use a binary indicator of rural-urban are less likely to observe a difference in access measures than studies that evaluate communities along a more specific continuum of rural-urban . A more specific scale acknowledges that large towns that are near major cities are very different from small towns in remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that focused on a specific region had differing results , than large scale studies that do not account for region , state , province , etc . There is a burgeoning body of literature on the effect of place of residence on health 9 , 10 and although not growing as quickly , there is also a body of inquiry into the effects of place of residence on health services utilisation 11 " 14 . Where people live has been shown to be associated with their health status , health behaviours , and their utilization of health care services . <p> In order to get a complete understanding of access to health care along the rural-urban continuum this study uses five different measures of access that reflect both potential and realized access ; uses a five level indicator of rural-urban status ; and accounts for location of residence at the levels of province , health region , and community . The first objective of this study is to compare access to health care services in Canada across the rural-urban continuum . The second objective is to determine how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once other determinants are accounted for . <h> Methods <p> This is a cross-sectional study of the population of the 10 provinces of Canada using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey ( CCHS 2.1 ) conducted in 2003 . Five different measures of access and utilization are compared across the continuum of rural-urban . Known determinants of utilization are taken into account according to Andersen 's Health Behaviour Model ( HBM ) 15 , and location of residence at the levels of province , health region , and community . <h> Data Source <p> The CCHS is a very comprehensive national population survey aimed at describing the health and health services experiences of Canadians . The survey was conducted by Statistics Canada in collaboration with the federal Ministry of Health , the territorial and provincial Ministries of Health , and the Canadian Institute for Health Information . The CCHS survey questionnaire was administered using computer-assisted interviewing in-person , when possible , and by telephone when a face-to-face interview was not feasible 16 . <p> Based on the available resources and the desire to produce reliable statistics at the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sample was divided among the provinces based on the population and the number of health regions . Each province 's sample was then distributed among the health regions proportionally to the square root of the population in each HR . The survey response rate was 80.7% . Individuals that were sampled but did not respond to the survey were accounted for in the survey weights 16 . <p> Statistics Canada estimates that the survey is representative of approximately 98% of the Canadian population aged 12 and older . The 2% that are not represented include those residing on Indian Reserves or Crown lands , in institutions , in certain remote areas of the territories , or who are full-time members of the Canadian Armed Forces 16 . <p> This study is based on data collected from adults aged 20 and older and lived in one of the 10 provinces of Canada . The two percent of survey subjects who had their responses given by proxy -- either because they were not available or they were unable to answer because of language or poor health -- were excluded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived outcome variables used in this analysis are : <p> having had an influenza vaccination in the previous two years ; <p> having seen a family physician in the previous 12 months ; <p> having seen a specialist physician ( other than an eye doctor ) in the previous 12 months ; <p> self-perceived unmet need in the previous 12 months ; and <p> having a regular medical doctor . <p> These outcomes were chosen because they reflect health care access from a broad range of sectors , including primary and secondary care ; preventative and therapeutic interventions ; and utilization and factors that facilitate utilization . These variables were also expected to show adequate variation across the population . <p> Having had an influenza vaccination in the last two years is an outcome measure of having received high quality primary health care . The 2002-2003 influenza season National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommendations to Health Canada state that people at risk of influenza-related complications be immunized : people with chronic conditions , residents of nursing homes , people age 65+ . They also recommend that people who are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care givers and health professionals be immunized . Finally , they recommend that healthy people who wish to avoid getting the flu be immunized 17 . <p> Self-perceived unmet need occurs when an individual feels that they required health care services but for one reason or another they did not receive them . Specifically respondents are asked " During the past 12 months , was there ever a time when you felt that you needed health care but did n't receive it ? " The benefit of using this outcome is that it does not rely on respondents seeing a physician . It provides some insight into the health care needs of those who have not seen a physician . <p> There are two different variables used to assess the use of physician services : having had one or more consultations with a family physician , and having had one or more consultations with a specialist physician . These were based on responses to the following questions . <p> 1 . <p> Not counting when you were an overnight patient , in the past 12 months , how many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your physical , emotional or mental health with : ... a family doctor , or general practitioner ? <p> 2 . <p> Not counting when you were an overnight patient , in the past 12 months , how many times have you seen , or talked on the telephone , about your physical , emotional or mental health with : ... any other medical doctor ( such as a surgeon , allergist , orthopaedist , gynaecologist or psychiatrist ) ? <p> It is estimated that the Canadian National average number of physician visits among those who had a visit in 2003 was 5.2 for family physician visits , and 3.2 for specialist visits 18 . <p> The final outcome measure was having a regular medical doctor . This measure of health behaviour is also an enabling resource in the health behaviour model . The variable was derived from the response to the questions " Do you have a regular medical doctor ? " Often this variable is referred to as usual source of care , however in this case the survey explicitly referred to a medical doctor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health services as realized access and to factors that facilitate the use of services as potential access 15 . To avoid confusion in this paper if the word access is used it will mean both potential and realized access in general , otherwise the specific component will be referred to directly . <p> The indicator used to represent communities on the rural-urban continuum is the Statistical Area Classification ( SAC ) 19 as recommended by Statistics Canada in the Rural and Small Town Canada Analysis Bulletin 20 . The basis of this definition is Census Subdivisions which are legislatively determined municipalities or equivalents . According to the definition each Census Subdivision with a population less than 10,000 is categorized as rural or small town . These rural and small towns are further classified into Metropolitan Influence Zones ( MIZs ) which are determined by the percentage of the community population that commutes to a city or urban centre for employment . Urban municipalities are classified as Census Agglomerations ( CAs ) , small urban centres with between 10,000 and 100,000 people , or Census Metropolitan Areas ( CMAs ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Statistical Area Classification is given in Table 1 along with the population of each category 21 , 22 . <p> One or more adjacent Census Subdivisions ( CSDs ) situated around a major urban core ( population G 100,000 ) . <p> 64.3 <p> Census Agglomerations ( CA ) <p> One or more adjacent CSDs situated around a major urban core ( population G 10,000 ) . <p> 15.1 <p> Rural <p> Strong Metropolitan Influenced Zone ( MIZ ) <p> A CSD where more than 30% of residents commute to work in an urban core ( population &lt; 10,000 ) . <p> 5.1 <p> Moderate MIZ <p> A CSD where between 5% and 30% of residents commute to work in an urban core ( population &lt; 10,000 ) . <p> 7.6 <p> Weak MIZ <p> A CSD where between 0% and 5% of residents commute to work in an urban core ( population &lt; 10,000 ) . <p> 6.6 <p> No MIZ <p> A CSD where forty or fewer residents commute to work in an urban core ( population &lt; 10,000 ) . <p> 1.1 <p> Geographic location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Consolidated Census Subdivision . Health care services are administered provincially in Canada and each province is divided into a number of health regions for administrative purposes . There are 126 health regions in the country and the number of health regions per province varies from one in each of the territories to 37 in the province of Ontario . Consolidated Census Subdivisions ( CCSs ) are municipalities or adjacent economically dependent communities 19 . <p> The other independent predictor variables were selected based on Andersen 's Health Behaviour Model ( HBM ) and other research on determinants in Canada 15 . These predictors were identified as components of : need , predisposing characteristics , and enabling factors . <p> Two measures of need are used in this study : the presence of chronic conditions and self-rated health status . The measure of chronic conditions indicates whether subjects have zero , one , or two or more chronic conditions . In the questionnaire respondents were given a list of chronic conditions ( Table 2 ) that was preceded by the instruction " Now I 'd like to ask about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested in ' long-term conditions ' which are expected to last or have already lasted 6 months or more and that have been diagnosed by a health professional . " The number of conditions reported by each person was summed . Self-rated health status is a widely used measure of need and has been shown to be strongly related to utilization of health care services . This measure has the five categories excellent , very good , good , fair , and poor which are rated by survey respondents in response to the question " In general , would you say your health is ? " <p> Table 2 <p> Chronic Conditions <p> Asthma <p> Cataracts <p> Fibromyalgia <p> Glaucoma <p> Arthritis or rheumatism <p> Thyroid condition <p> High blood pressure <p> Chronic fatigue syndrome <p> Migraine headaches <p> Multiple chemical sensitivities <p> Diabetes <p> Schizophrenia <p> Epilepsy <p> Mood disorder <p> Heart Disease <p> Anxiety disorder <p> Cancer <p> Other developmental disorder <p> Stomach or intestinal ulcers <p> Eating disorder <p> Effects of stroke <p> Chronic bronchitis <p> Bowel disorder/Crohn 's or colitis <p> Emphysema of COPD <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions <p> Predisposing characteristics describe an individual 's propensity to use health care services . They are generally demographic factors that are related to utilisation and are not easily altered . The predisposing variable used in this study were : sex , age , marital status , educational attainment , and ethnic origin . <p> Enabling resources are the means that individuals have available to them for the use of health care services . These factors are generally more mutable than predisposing characteristics , as they include such things as insurance and availability of physicians . Other enabling factors that are not as easily modified , at least in the short term , are household income , and employment status . The enabling factors used in this study were : having a regular medical doctor , income adequacy , having pharmaceuticals insurance , and occupation class . <p> Note that the variable " has a regular medical doctor " is included as both an enabling resource ( independent variable ) and a measure of access ( dependent variable ) . Having a regular medical doctor is a resource that enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor to provide care when needed is an indicator of access . <p> Greater detail on each of the variables can be found in the survey documentation 16 . <h> Missing Data <p> For each question or category of questions there is a percentage of respondents for whom the question was not appropriate , or who were unable or unwilling to answer . Comparisons of the rates with and without the missing values revealed very little difference in most cases . The only notable difference was in income adequacy , where a response is not given for 12.3% of the theoretical population . Dropping these records from the analysis would mean dropping a substantial percentage of the sample and may lead to misleading conclusions . Because income adequacy is an important variable to consider as a determinant of health services utilization a category for " Not Stated " was included in the analysis . Because a separate coefficient/odds ratio was be assigned to this category it is assumed that these people have something in common with each other , and that the non-responders are not randomly distributed through the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first objective was to calculate unadjusted odds ratios to compare each access measure across the rural-urban continuum . To address the second objective multilevel logistic regression models were developed that included the HBM variables and accounted for location at the levels of province , health region , and without CCS . The odds ratios for the six levels of rural-urban were evaluated at each iteration of the model . To build the logistic regression models and decide on the variables used the steps outlined by Hosmer and Lemeshow were followed 23 . <p> Multilevel models were developed following the methods described by Luke and Snijders 24 , 25 . The observed variance that is attributed to health region and CCS was reported as intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) 24 , and median odds ratio ( MOR ) . The ICC is interpreted as the proportion of the overall variance that is attributable to a given level of the data hierarchy 24 . The median odds ratio ( MOR ) is used to quantify the heterogeneity between place of residence on the odds ratio scale so that it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects variables 26 " 28 . <p> As with any complex survey design the subjects in this study were not a simple random sample of the population . The CCHS used a multi-staged cluster design where each subject is assigned a weight indicating the number of individuals that they are meant to represent . The weights are used to derive meaningful estimates of population rates . A bootstrap re-sampling technique is used to estimate any sampling error in the survey when calculating the variances and confidence intervals 16 . <h> Results <p> The survey sample for this study includes 111,258 individuals aged 20 or older that lived in one of the ten Canadian provinces in 2003 . After applying the sampling weights , the sample represents approximately 22.6 million people or 69.5% of the population of Canada . <p> The first objective of this study is to compare access to health care services in Canada across the rural-urban continuum . Table 3 and Table 4 compare the access measures across SAC . These results show that residents of Census Agglomerations , that is small cities not adjacent to major centres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family physician services , were most likely to have a regular medical doctor , and were most likely to report unmet need . Among the rural categories there was a gradient with the most rural ( no or weak Metropolitan Influence Zone MIZ ) being least likely to have had a flu shot , use specialist physicians services , or have a regular medical doctor . Residents of the most urban centres ( Central Metropolitan Area CMA ) are more likely to report using specialist physician services . <p> The second objective of this study is to evaluate how much variation in access there is once other determinants are taken in to account . Multiple logistic regression models were built to assess factors that are related to each of the five access measures and to evaluate how much the variation across the rural/urban continuum changes once these factors are controlled for . These models are given in Additional file 1 , Appendix . <p> The two indicators of need , self-rated health status and chronic conditions , are very strong predictors of access and show a clear pattern across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and sex were strongly related to the access measures , with older people and women reporting higher levels of utilization . Women have a higher likelihood of using health care services , having a regular medical doctor and reporting unmet health care needs . Those aged 70 or higher are less likely to use specialist physician services than those in the younger age groups . People in the oldest age groups are also less likely to report having had unmet health care needs . Being married or equivalent increases the likelihood of a family or specialist physician visit and of having a regular medical doctor . Marital status is not related to having a flu shot or reporting unmet need . <p> Those with the highest level of educational attainment , post-secondary school graduation , were more likely to report having had a flu shot to have had a consultation with a physician ; and to report having unmet health care needs . Those with the lowest level of education , less than secondary school graduation , had a significantly lower likelihood of having seen a specialist physician . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more likely to report receiving an influenza vaccination and having a regular medical doctor ; and were less likely to have consulted a family or specialist physician , and report unmet health care needs . <p> There is a relationship between income and access in this study . Those in the lowest quartile for household income were less likely to have had a flu shot , have seen a specialist or to have a regular medical doctor . They were more likely to report having unmet need and equally as likely to have seen a family physician . Having pharmaceutical insurance is positively related to all five access measures even though none of them are directly related to the purchase of pharmaceuticals . An unusual pattern is seen among people who were employed for only part of the year . These people were less likely to have a flu shot , more likely to report unmet need , more likely to see a family or specialist physician and less likely to have a regular medical doctor . <p> There is a great deal of variation by province in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of the survey show that residents of Ontario have the greatest odds of receiving a flu shot while residents of Newfoundland have the lowest odds . Variation by province is also revealed in physician utilisation with residents of Quebec and Ontario being less likely to report having consulted a family physician in the previous 12 months and residents of Quebec having a 36% higher likelihood of consulting a specialist physician . Residents of Nova Scotia have a greater than two-fold increase in their likelihood of having a regular medical doctor while residents of Quebec have a reduced odds of reporting having a regular medical doctor . The municipality ( CCS ) of residence is attributed with a moderate level of variation in each of the outcomes , most marked being having a regular medical doctor . There is only a very small amount of variation attributed to health region . <p> Table 5 presents the adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals for rural-urban status and place of residence . In order to assess the influence of the independent variables on access by rural-urban status Figure 1 compares the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables in the HBM , and adjusting for both HBM variables and location of residence . There is very little change in the odds of having received a flu shot after adjusting for the HBM variables . After adjustment for place of residence the differences are diminished with only those living in the most rural communities having a lower odds of receiving a flu shot . After adjusting for place there is no longer a statistically significant difference in the odds of reporting unmet health care needs between the two urban categories . Those in rural areas are less likely to report unmet need even after adjusting for HBM and place of residence . Most of the variation in family physician consultations is accounted for by need , predisposing characteristics , and enabling factors . Taking the effect of place into account eliminates any difference for those in the most urban cities . Those living in urban centres were more likely to have seen a specialist physician ; this difference is not accounted for by HBM variables or place of residence . The lower rate of specialist utilisation by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province , health region , and community of residence . Those living in the most urban and the most rural are least likely to have a regular medical doctor regardless of the HBM factors or place of residence . <h> Discussion <p> The results show that there is inequity in access to health care services across the rural-urban continuum , and that some of this inequity remains once other determinants are accounted for . <p> The finding that there is no difference in utilization of family physicians along the rural-urban continuum have been previously reported based on data from the CCHS 29 , as have the findings regarding urban residents being more likely to consult a specialist physician 14 , 28 , 30 , 31 , These findings are likely a result of supply induced demand , where the concentration of specialist physicians in urban centres and of family physicians in smaller cities brings about higher rates of specialist physician utilisation in large cities 32 . This maldistribution of physicians across the country can also explain why residents of the most urban and most rural communities were less likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents in major urban cities may also be due to the availability of drop-in health clinics meaning residents can obtain care at a time and location that is convenient rather than establishing a regular medical doctor 33 . <p> Residents of rural communities were less likely to report having unmet health care needs . An optimistic interpretation of this finding is that rural residents are indeed having their health care needs met , however given their similar level of utilization of family physicians , lower usage of specialist physicians and poorer health status , this is unlikely . This result suggests different expectations of the health care system , leading to rural residents having a different threshold at which they report their needs being unmet . Researchers in Australia found that rural residents are more likely to postpone seeking care until economically or socially convenient which may influence their response to this question 34 , 35 . <p> That a great deal of variation in access is observed between the provinces is not surprising given health care is organized and provided at the provincial level . This is particularly evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a flu shot since Ontario is the only province to have provided universal influenza vaccination coverage since the 2000-01 flu season 36 , 37 . The addition of place of residence to the logistic regression model causes the odds ratios for the two most rural categories to move closer to 1 , leaving only the most rural category as less likely to have a flu shot . <p> Variation by province is also revealed in physician utilisation , with residents of Quebec and Ontario being less likely to report having consulted a family physician ; residents of Quebec having a higher likelihood of consulting a specialist physician ; residents of Nova Scotia have a greater likelihood of having a regular medical doctor ; and residents of Quebec have a significantly reduced odds of having a regular medical doctor . Similar results have been previously reported based on data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey ( 1994 ) 31 and the CCHS ( 2001 ) 38 , 39 . <p> The results from Quebec are different from the rest of the country with residents having a greater odds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family physician , they are also less likely to have a regular medical doctor . It appears as though residents of Quebec are permitted to see a specialist physician without a referral from a family physician which is different from the rest of the country where a referral is required in order to see a specialist physician . It has also been suggested that Quebecers receive more care from community health clinics and so do not report having a regular medical doctor 33 . <p> The CCS , or municipality , of residence is attributed with a moderate level of variation in each of the physician related outcomes , most marked being having a regular medical doctor . Municipality of residence plays a role because it is at this level at which health care resources are immediately available . People in a given community share the same geographic/physical barriers to seeking care . Community level characteristics that may influence this result include physician supply , average neighbourhood income , ethnic composition , unemployment rates , income inequality , supply of community health centres , percentage of non-citizens , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmet need by community may be related to resources that are available within the community . It could also be associated with expectations of the health care system which are defined in part at a community level . The addition of place of residence to the logistic regression models reduces the observed differences along the rural-urban categories and in a few cases it moves categories from showing a statistically significant difference to no differences . <p> Overall the small contribution from health region to each of the five outcomes is likely due , in part , to the specific survey measures being used . Although a good deal of health care services administration and planning occurs at the health region level , this is usually related to acute and long term care facilities and community care functions . In general , physician reimbursement and workforce planning occurs at the provincial level . It may also be a result of the health regions being too large and heterogeneous to reflect any place effect . A study previously done in the province of Ontario found that health regions accounted for less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller jurisdictional areas reflected more of a place effect 48 . <p> The limitations of this study are largely related to the design and conduct of the Canadian Community Health Survey ( CCHS ) . Because the study is based on survey data there is a risk of a recall bias : respondents are asked to remember their utilization in the previous twelve months , and previous two years in the case of influenza vaccines . There are limitations related to the target sample of the survey , most notably the exclusion of a large number of Aboriginal Canadians through exclusion of Indian reserves , Crown land , and very remote areas . This may result in overestimating the level of access in rural areas . <p> The results of this study update the literature on access to health care services across the rural-urban continuum while controlling for other factors that are associated with access to care . The main strengths of this study are the use of data from a large nationally representative survey which allows for the identification of variation that might not otherwise be detected ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of residence at a number of nested levels ; and using the Statistical Area Classification to identify rural and urban status in six categories which provides greater sensitivity . <h> Conclusions <p> This study highlights some areas where there is inequity in access and utilisation of care . The greatest degree of inequity is in utilisation of specialist physician services with those who reside in major urban centres or the province of Quebec being more likely to have consulted a specialist . The observed differences in self-reported unmet need present interesting questions about expectations . Further work needs to be done to understand rural residents expectations and their interpretation of the survey questions . Variation of effects across municipalities is an important area for further study and should include factors such as physician supply ; travel distance required for health care ; and socio-economic factors such as community income levels and proportion of the population that is Aboriginal . <p> Based on the findings of this study , researchers who are evaluating potential inequities in access , should at the very least include province or region of the country as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by health region or municipality is plausible , place of residence at these levels should also be accounted for . <p> An important message of this paper for health care policy makers is that despite universal health insurance coverage , inequities in access to care still exists between rural and urban residents . These inequities can be masked when evaluation is done at a very large scale with gross indicators of rural-urban and when the determinants of access , including place of residence are not taken into account . Understanding the relationship between rural-urban and other determinants will help policy makers to target interventions appropriately : to specific demographic , provincial , community , or rural categories . <h> List of Abbreviations <p> CA : <p> Census Agglomerations <p> CCHS : <p> Canadian Community Health Survey <p> CCS : <p> Consolidated Census Subdivisions <p> CHA : <p> Canada Health Act <p> CI : <p> Confidence Interval <p> CMA : <p> Census Metropolitan Areas <p> CSD : <p> Census Subdivisions <p> HBM : <p> Health Behaviour Model <p> ICC : <p> Intraclass Correlation Coefficients <p> MIZ : <p> Metropolitan Influenced Zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Statistical Area Classification . <h> Declarations <h> Acknowledgements <p> This research was funded with a doctoral research award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research . <h> Electronic supplementary material <p> **36;531;TOOLONG file 1 : Appendix - Multilevel Logistic Regression Models for All Outcomes .

No studies were found that evaluated the effects of P4P on healthcare costs . <h> Conclusion <p> The number of P4P schemes to encourage disease management is limited . Hardly any information is available about the effects of such schemes on healthcare quality and costs . <h> Background <p> Chronic diseases are the leading cause of disability and death in the Western part of the world 1 . Over the coming years , the prevalence of chronic diseases is predicted to increase as a result of the rapid aging of the world population and the greater longevity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems struggle with coordinating care to people with chronic conditions . The healthcare system , traditionally predominated by a re-active approach and consisting of highly specialized echelons , needs to be transformed to realize patient-centered chronic care in which problems like fragmentation , restricted self-management , and guideline non-adherence are limited 4 , 5 . <p> To deal with this challenge , policymakers and professionals introduced disease management programs ( also referred to as e.g. case management , integrated care , managed care , and shared care ) to enhance quality and continuity of care for the chronically i 'll . In broad terms disease management refers to a patient-centered approach of coordinated multiple healthcare interventions that aim to structure chronic care to a specific patient group 4 , 6 . A model that is perhaps best known from an international perspective , and that was used for this study to make disease management operational , is the Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) of Wagner et al . 5 , 7 . This model can be considered as a guide towards improving management and co-ordination of chronic conditions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. health care organization , community resources , self-management support , decision support , delivery system design , and clinical information system ) and that integration of these components is the key towards improving chronic care management 4 . <p> It is generally believed that disease management programs result into improved patient health outcomes and into healthcare cost savings . There is , however , a lack of conclusive scientific evidence supporting these suggestions 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 . Nevertheless , interest in pay-for-performance ( P4P ) as a tool to stimulate delivery of chronic care through disease management is growing . P4P is a payment model that rewards healthcare providers for meeting pre-established targets for delivery of healthcare services by financial incentives 10 . Based on their performance , healthcare providers receive either additional or reduced payment . The reasoning behind P4P schemes is , by either rewarding or punishing healthcare providers for their performance , to improve quality of care 11 , 12 . P4P schemes , also known as e.g. performance based incentive programs and quality incentive payment systems , should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recompensing delivery of healthcare services by healthcare providers via retrospective ( e.g. fee-for-service or bundled payment ) or prospective ( e.g. capitation ) payment contracts . <p> To date , little is known about the use of P4P schemes to stimulate delivery of chronic care through disease management and whether such schemes actually affect healthcare quality and healthcare costs . The objectives of the present paper are therefore ( i ) to provide an overview of P4P schemes that are currently used to stimulate delivery of chronic care through disease management and ( ii ) to gain insight into the effects of P4P on healthcare quality and healthcare costs . <h> Methods <h> Study design and search strategy <p> A systematic review of the literature was performed for insight into P4P schemes aiming at stimulation of delivery of chronic care through disease management . We conducted our search in PubMed focusing on English language papers published between January 2000 and January 2010 . A comprehensive search strategy was developed by a librarian of our institute to identify studies matching the following search terms ( Medical Subject Headings ) : case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , disease management , managed care programs , patient care management , patient-centered care , shared care , transmural care and variations of the keywords chronic disease , chronically i 'll , chronic illness , long term care and specified chronic conditions . These search terms were combined with variations of the following search terms : bundled payment , fee for services , health care reform , incentives , local partnerships , pay for performance , payment methods , practice based commissioning , physician incentive plans , prospective payment system , quality assurance , and reimbursement ( mechanisms ) . <p> In addition to the electronic database search , relevant papers were identified through reference tracking and through a manual literature search on the internet . To obtain up-to-date information about the included P4P schemes , also websites of the P4P schemes and other relevant websites such as those of health insurers and Ministries of Health were consulted . <h> Study selection <p> Two reviewers ( JS and SdB ) independently reviewed the papers extracted by the search for their relevance by screening their title and abstract . If found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any disagreement between the reviewers was resolved by consensus . Papers describing P4P schemes focusing on the implementation of disease management programs were included . <p> In line with earlier studies 9 , 13 , 14 also in this study the chronic care model ( CCM ) of Wagner et al . 5 , 7 was used to make disease management operational . The model suggests that disease management ideally comprises six interrelated components . Four components refer to the actual delivery of care by healthcare providers of a healthcare organization ; 1 . self-management support that helps patients and their families to obtain skills and confidence to manage their chronic condition ( e.g. blood glucose monitoring ) and assessment of problems and achievements on a regular basis ; 2. delivery system design ; focus on coordinated multidisciplinary collaboration between caregivers ( i.e. multidisciplinary team , individual care plans ) ; 3. decision support ; evidence-based guidelines providing clinical standards for high-quality chronic care , and 4. development of clinical information systems ; supplying care teams with feedback , reminding them to comply with practice guidelines and providing registries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two remaining components mainly refer to the context where chronic care is provided : 5. the healthcare system which encompasses the aforementioned elements , refers to the organizational context where chronic care is provided . A healthcare system seeking to improve chronic care must be motivated and prepared for change throughout the organization . Leadership must identify care improvement as important work , and translate it into clear improvement goals and policies that are addressed through application of effective improvement strategies and 6. links towards community resources and policies . The healthcare system is embedded in a community that includes organizations/programs that may support or expand a healthcare system 's care for chronically i 'll patients ( e.g. physical activity programs delivered by a local fitness centre ) . In our study , the term disease management was used for programs that included interventions that could be related to two or more components of the CCM . <h> Data extraction <p> P4P schemes identified by the literature search were described on the basis of the nine dimensions of P4P schemes defined by Conrad and Perry 10 ( Table 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes . We additionally reported the country where the scheme was introduced , the CCM elements to which the scheme could be related , and the goal of each scheme ( Table 2 ) . Of the papers reporting studies that evaluated the effects of P4P on quality of healthcare and healthcare costs we described the characteristics of the evaluation study ( e.g. design , sample size , years of data collection ) , outcome measures , and study outcomes ( Table 3 ) . <p> Table 1 <p> Features of P4P schemes and their dimensions <p> Feature <p> Dimensions <p> 1 .

On the basis of their title and abstract , 52 papers were selected to be retrieved full-text for in-depth screening . This screening process resulted into 12 papers eligible for our review . Reasons for exclusion are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through reference tracking and through a manual literature search on the internet . Hence , 18 papers were included in our review . The 18 papers described eight different P4P schemes that intend to improve chronic care delivery through disease management ( Table 2 ) . Some papers described the same P4P scheme which helped us to retrieve the fullest possible information about the different characteristics of the P4P schemes . <p> We distinguished two categories of P4P schemes : 1 . P4P schemes in which financial incentives are granted to healthcare providers for delivering chronic care through disease management . In these schemes , rewards are granted by health insurers , health plans or managed care organizations if healthcare providers deliver chronic care via disease management programs ( WNY-P4P , PBIP , BWPO-P4P , BTE , IHA-P4P , PIP-DI , and MPGPD ) and 2 . P4P schemes in which financial incentives are granted to health insurers to motivate them to enroll patients in disease management programs ( DMP-P4P ) . In this scheme sickness funds are rewarded by the German government for enrolling patients in disease management programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included P4P schemes were part of a larger scheme of interventions ( i.e. quality improvement program ) to improve quality of chronic care ( WNY-PIP , PBIP , BWPO-P4P , PIP-DI , and MPGPD ) . In these schemes , P4P was simultaneously implemented with other interventions that can be related to elements of the CCM . Financial incentives were directed at healthcare providers to reward their participation in these schemes of quality improvement interventions . Three of the eight included P4P schemes were solely implemented ( BTE , IHA-P4P , and DMP-P4P ) . In these P4P schemes , financial incentives are directed at healthcare providers or health insurers to stimulate them to implement interventions that can be related to elements of the CCM . In these schemes , financial incentives are granted after the implementation of interventions related to elements of the CCM . <p> Irrespective of the type of P4P scheme ( i.e. P4P schemes part of a larger scheme of interventions vs. sole P4P schemes ) , we determined that the schemes stimulated delivery of chronic care through disease management by interventions that can be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCM elements " decision support " ( e.g. clinical guidelines , assessment tools ) and " adoption of a clinical information system " ( e.g. electronic medical records , reminder letters , sharing practice specific data for benchmarking and reflective information feedback ) were observed in almost all P4P schemes . Self-management support interventions ( e.g. patient education ) were observed in WNY-P4P , PIP-DI , MPGPD , and DMP-P4P , whereas delivery system design interventions ( e.g. home visits , patient outreach coordinator ) were only observed in the WNY-P4P , MPGPD , and BWPO-P4P . <h> Goals <p> Generally , the goals of the P4P schemes were to stimulate delivery of high-quality and cost-effective chronic care , and ultimately to improve patient health . Most P4P schemes focused on delivery of integrated care for diabetes and/or asthma ( WNY-P4P ; BWPO-P4P ; BTE ; IHA ; PIP-DI ; MPGPD ; DMP-P4P ) . Some P4P schemes additionally focused on care to other chronic patients including cardiac care ( BTE ; IHA-P4P ; MPDGP ) , depression care ( BTE ) , and COPD care ( DMP-P4P ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown ( PBIP ) . <h> Type <p> In seven of the eight P4P schemes , financial incentives were framed as rewards for delivering chronic care through disease management ( WNY-P4P ; PBIP ; BTE ; IHA-P4P ; PIP-DI ; MPGPD ) or for enrolling patients in disease management programs ( DMP-P4P ) . In one P4P scheme ( BWPO-P4P ) , the financial incentive was framed as a penalty . Annual physician or hospital fees were withheld and were only returned if quality targets were achieved . <h> Incented entity <p> The incented entities differed over the eight included P4P schemes . In seven P4P schemes , financial incentives were granted to healthcare providers of which five were granted to groups of healthcare providers ( e.g. physician groups , multidisciplinary groups of caregivers ) ( PBIP ; BWPO-P4P ; IHA-P4P ; PIP-DI ; MPGPD ) , whereas two were granted to individual healthcare providers ( e.g. recognized physician , nurse practitioner , physician assistant ) ( WNY-P4P ; BTE ) . In one P4P scheme , the financial incentive was granted to sickness funds ( DMP-P4P ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives were granted on the basis of performance on a combination of structure ( n = 6 ) and/or process indicators ( n = 6 ) . Performance on outcome indicators was less frequently used as a basis for granting financial incentives ( n = 4 ) . In one P4P scheme , the financial incentive was only based on performance on structure indicators ( DMP-P4P ) . In two P4P schemes , financial incentives were based on performance on structure and process outcomes ( BTE ; PIP-DI ) . In three P4P schemes , financial incentives were based on performance on process and outcome indicators ( WNY-PIP ; BWPO-P4P ; MPGPD ) and in two P4P schemes , financial incentives were based on structure , process , and outcome indicators ( PBIP ; IHA-P4P ) . <p> Structure indicators were mostly based on the use of IT services ( e.g. patient registries , recall/reminder system , electronic medical records ) ( e.g. BTE ; PIP-DI ) or having implemented a certified program ( DMP-P4P ) . Process measures targeted at clinical quality ( e.g. working according to national standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were often a subset of the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set ( HEDIS ) ( e.g. BWPO-P4P ; BTE ; IHA-P4P ; MPGPD ) . Of the four financial incentives that were ( partly ) granted on the basis of performance on outcome measures , two P4P schemes targeted at patient experience/satisfaction ( PBIP ; IHA-P4P ) whereas three financial incentives ( WNY-P4P ; BWPO-P4P , MPGPD ) targeted at clinical outcome ( i.e. % of patients with HbA1c value G 7.5 or blood pressure G 130/80 ) . <h> Scope <p> Selective incentives were observed in six P4P schemes ( WNY-P4P ; BWPO-P4P ; BTE ; IHA-P4P ; PIP-DI ; MPGPD ) . These incentives targeted at specific domains of quality ( e.g. periodic blood pressure readings , cholesterol screening , HbA1c screening ) and were granted on the basis of scoring on established criteria of quality performance . A general incentive was observed in one P4P scheme ( DMP-P4P ) . This incentive targeted at a general domain of quality , i.e. whether or not sickness funds set up disease management programs . The scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Motivation <p> Information about whether the P4P-schemes affect intrinsic or extrinsic motivation to deliver high quality care was lacking in the papers that we included in our review . We therefore can not provide any information about this characteristic of the included P4P schemes . <h> Scale <p> Absolute performance incentives were observed in six P4P schemes ( WNY-P4P ; BTE ; IHA ; PIP-DI ; DMP-P4P ; MPGPD ) . Incentives were granted if healthcare providers or sickness funds meet established performance measures . Relative performance incentives were observed in three P4P schemes ( PBIP ; PIP-DI ; MPGPD ) . Healthcare providers participating in these programs only received bonus payment if they exceeded performance of other healthcare providers . <h> Certainty <p> Five of the P4P schemes ( WNY-PIP ; BTE ; IHA-P4P ; PIP-DI ; DMP-P4P ) had guaranteed reward schedules , provided that established targets were achieved . Two studies illustrate by the number of physicians not receiving a reward that , despite the ( partly ) guaranteed reward schedules , targets established in the P4P schemes may not be easily achievable . A study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned a financial reward 16 . Also a study that evaluated the MPGPD , a scheme where rewards are granted on the basis of absolute and relative performance , showed that 2 out of 10 physician groups earned a financial reward 32 . <p> In three P4P schemes ( PBIP ; BWPO-P4P ; MPGPD ) , providing financial incentives was ( partly ) based on high relative performance . Rewarding only the top performers creates competition . This approach introduces uncertainty because a bonus depends not only on a healthcare providers ' own performance but also on that of other healthcare providers in the network . Healthcare providers do n't know in advance whether they will exceed competing healthcare providers . <h> Size , frequency , and duration <p> Of most P4P schemes , size , frequency , and duration of the financial incentives were not or only briefly described . Of six P4P schemes ( WNY-PIP ; PIP-DI ; BWPO-P4P ; BTE , IHA-P4P ; MPGPD ) some information was available about the incentive size . Of four of these incentives , the size depended on the composite performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The precise size of rewards could change over time and could differ between the health plans that participated in the quality improvement programs . Health plans that participated in the IHA-P4P scheme determined their own budget and methodology for calculating and distributing payments to physician groups ( IHA-P4P ) . Healthcare providers participating in PIP-DI received payment per standardized whole patient equivalent ( IT structure ) or per patient ( that completed a cycle of care ) . No information was available about the size of the financial incentives granted via the PBIP and DMP-P4P . <h> Effects pay-for-performance schemes <p> Of the 18 included papers , only five reported effects of P4P on healthcare quality 16 , 30 , 37 " 39 , whereas no papers were found that reported the effects of P4P on healthcare costs . Of the five papers , four reported the effects of specified P4P schemes ( WNY-PIP ; PIP-DI ; IHA-P4P ) on healthcare performance , whereas one paper reported the effects of financial incentives in general versus the effects of other external incentives . <p> The evaluated aspects of healthcare delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of P4P on the quality of care delivered . Scott et al . 38 revealed that PIP-DI increased the probability of a HbA1c test being ordered which implies a positive effect on quality of care in diabetes management . In the other study on PIP-DI , physicians were asked to what extent they implemented the nationally established minimum requirements to diabetes care . The study indicates that financial incentives promote better clinical management of diabetes patients : GPs claiming financial incentives were more likely to comply with all requirements than GPs that did not claim incentives 37 . Also the study that evaluated the effects of WNY-PIP on healthcare quality showed that the majority of the participating physicians improved their average score on process ( i.e. screening of clinical parameters ) and outcome ( i.e. patient outcome ) indicators 16 . The study evaluating the effects of IHA-P4P found that quality improvement efforts , such as P4P schemes , are positively related with improved delivery of clinical processes of care . <p> The study that evaluated the effects of external incentives , including financial incentives , did not find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on quality of care measures between organized care management processes . However , significant relationships were found for other external incentives such as public recognition and better contracts for healthcare quality and organized care management processes 39 . <h> Discussion <p> This systematic literature review presents an overview of P4P schemes that are currently used to stimulate delivery of chronic care through disease management and provides insights into their effects . P4P schemes are increasingly implemented in the healthcare system to encourage improvements in healthcare quality . Well-known examples of such schemes are the Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration Project introduced in the USA and the NHS Quality and Outcomes Framework and the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation Payment Framework introduced in the UK 12 , 21 , 40 , 41 . The increasing number of implemented P4P schemes has led to a mounting number of studies on the effects of such schemes . These studies have , however , not specified their results for P4P schemes that are used to stimulate delivery of chronic care through disease management 42 " 44 . The increasing number of disease management programs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for insight into P4P schemes focusing on the implementation of disease management programs . <p> The included P4P schemes were systematically disentangled according to the dimensions of P4P schemes defined by Conrad and Perry 10 . This classification is in line with the characterization of P4P schemes of other authors who have recently published their work in this field e.g. 12 , 43 , 45 . Systematically describing the P4P schemes facilitated comparison of their characteristics and effects . This process revealed that retrieving complete and up-to-date information about the characteristics of P4P schemes was difficult . In most papers schemes were not well-described and information given was often dated . Particularly , information about the certainty , motivation , size , frequency , and duration of the P4P schemes was difficult to obtain . <p> The included P4P schemes were rather similar in their goals ( i.e. improving quality , continuity , and efficiency of care for the chronically i 'll ) but differed in how to achieve these goals . Financial incentives targeting at healthcare providers strived for improvement of quality and continuity of care by stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas incentives targeting at health insurers strived for improvement of quality and continuity of care by stimulating health insurers to enroll patients in disease management programs . We did not identify P4P schemes in combination with financial incentives for patients ( e.g. rewarding patients for participating in disease management programs ) . <p> The included P4P schemes mostly stimulated delivery of chronic care through disease management by interventions that can be related to the CCM elements " decision support " and " clinical information system " . This finding can possibly be explained by the fact that interventions related to these CCM elements are mostly implemented before interventions related to the other elements of the CCM 13 , 14 . <p> Our literature review yielded only five papers that reported studies on the effects of P4P on healthcare quality 16 , 30 , 37 " 39 . No papers were found that reported studies evaluating the effects of P4P on healthcare costs . Most studies showed positive effects of P4P on the quality of care delivered . It should , however , be noted that the observed differences between schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consequence drawing conclusions on the effectiveness of P4P to stimulate delivery of chronic care through disease management in general . It is therefore not possible to determine the characteristics of P4P schemes that may contribute to improved healthcare quality . This is in line with earlier studies that suggest that the effectiveness of P4P schemes is highly variable in terms of e.g. complications , ER waiting times , length of hospital stay , and screening rates and that the effectiveness depends on the design of the schemes and the characteristics of the context where they are introduced 11 , 43 , 44 . It should further be noted , that since our study mainly yielded studies showing positive effects of P4P schemes , publication bias should be taken into account . Since almost no studies were found showing no effects of P4P , it is difficult to determine the characteristics of P4P schemes that may not affect healthcare quality and healthcare costs . <p> Another issue which complicates drawing conclusions with regard to the effectiveness of P4P , which is also highlighted by other authors , is that P4P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also the P4P schemes included in this study were mostly part of a larger scheme of interventions and were simultaneously implemented with other interventions than can be related to elements of the CCM such as patient registries , physician reminders and feedback , and the implementation of evidence-based guidelines and protocols . Such interventions also focus on changing healthcare providers ' behavior and may interact with the potential effect of P4P . It is therefore difficult to determine the isolated effect of P4P on healthcare quality and related costs . Additionally , as also mentioned by Chaix-Couturier et al . 11 and Christianson et al . 44 , contextual factors like the characteristics of the healthcare system where the P4P scheme is implemented ( e.g. healthcare purchasing system , degree of regulation , financing mechanisms of the healthcare system ) , organizational aspects of the healthcare organization where the P4P scheme is implemented , and personal characteristics of the healthcare providers participating in the P4P scheme may also interact with the effect of the scheme and therefore further complicates comparability of the effects of P4P schemes . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also relevant to have information about the healthcare system where the P4P scheme is implemented and the simultaneously implemented interventions and their features . <p> Although the aforementioned issues complicate drawing conclusions with regard to which P4P schemes are most successful , there are some indications for the design characteristics of P4P schemes that may produce the largest effects . First , payment on the basis of scoring on process-based incentives may be more effective than indicators that are less directly related to a healthcare providers ' performance 10 , 43 . Second , P4P schemes including a blend of individual- and group-level incentives may be more effective than P4P schemes only including individual or only including group-level incentives . Some performance issues can be improved most efficiently through group action , whereas others can be improved most efficiently through individual action 10 , 43 , 45 . Third , there are indications that P4P schemes rewarding absolute performance may be more effective than schemes rewarding relative performance . Rewarding relative performance may create uncertainty about the amount of additional revenue that can be obtained , because one 's reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network . This , in turn , may result into unwillingness of providers to make investments in quality improvement . Moreover , only rewarding top performers may discourage healthcare providers with lower baseline quality to improve their services since for them it is difficult to outperform healthcare providers who already have high baseline quality 10 , 21 , 43 , 45 . It should , however , be noted that there are also indications that relative performance incentives are more effective in improving healthcare quality since they offer an ongoing incentive for initial high-quality providers to continue to perform well relative to their network 21 . <p> On the basis of the current literature it is unclear whether these findings also apply to the design of P4P schemes to encourage delivery of care through disease management . Since evidence for the effectiveness of these P4P schemes is scarce , it is recommended to design methodologically sound studies to gain insight into the design characteristics that are most successful . Empirical evidence is necessary to carefully design P4P schemes and to ensure their effectiveness 10 , 42 , 43 , 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P4P on equity in healthcare . A recent study of Doran et al . 46 suggests that the Quality and Outcomes Framework , implemented in the United Kingdom , has the potential to reduce inequalities in the delivery of primary clinical care . It is unknown if P4P schemes used to stimulate delivery of chronic care through disease management will produce similar effects . It is therefore recommended to include equity in healthcare as an outcome in future studies in this field . <p> When designing P4P schemes to stimulate disease management , it should further be taken into account that P4P schemes may also have negative consequences for the quality of care . A potential negative effect , also known as the " distortion effect " , is the theoretical concern that stimulation of efforts on the measures of healthcare performance included in the P4P scheme may discourage efforts on aspects of healthcare performance that are not included and rewarded by the scheme . As a result , P4P may result into reduced healthcare quality , rather than into the intended improved healthcare quality 16 , 32 . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluating the effectiveness of P4P schemes . <h> Conclusion <p> The number of P4P schemes intending to encourage delivery of chronic care through disease management is still limited .

@@13586384 @2186384/ <h> Search Briefs <h> Alerts <h> Article <h> Individual Mandate ( Updated ) <p> Individual Mandate : Congress is now weighing different versions of a requirement that individuals obtain health insurance . <p> What 's the issue ? <p> The separate versions of health reform legislation passed by the two houses of Congress would impose a national individual mandate requiring most Americans to have health insurance . New standards would be set to determine " acceptable " minimum coverage and spell out how much people needed to contribute out of their own pockets . Depending on an individual 's circumstances , coverage could be obtained in various ways , including through employers , through government health programs , or through new federal or state health insurance exchanges . Subsidies would make coverage more affordable for low- and moderate-income people , and insurance market reforms would make coverage more accessible and reliable . Penalties would be imposed on individuals who did not obtain coverage and who were not exempted from the requirement for various reasons . <p> For supporters , including President Barack Obama , the individual mandate is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have or to contribute toward health insurance is viewed as central to reducing the number of uninsured people . Health insurers also regard an individual mandate as a critical element of a package of reforms that would require them to abandon some practices and meet new requirements . <p> Opponents of an individual mandate object for different reasons . Some who are or lean libertarian consider the proposal a coercive move by government . Others object to the fact that the mandate would force many people to spend a sizable portion of their incomes on health insurance -- perhaps for coverage that is not especially generous . Still others consider an individual mandate unenforceable . <p> As described below , a number of technical aspects of a mandate would be critical to determining how well it would either accomplish supporters ' goals for coverage or feed opponents ' fears about the cost burden that would be imposed on many . <p> What 's the background ? <p> This is not the first time an individual mandate has been proposed at the national level in the United States . The concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Act , the national health reform legislation proposed by then-President Bill Clinton . It was also the centerpiece of alternative reform proposals , such as that proposed by Rep. Jim Cooper , then representing Tennessee 's 4th District . <p> The concept died with the collapse of health reform efforts in 1994 , but it surfaced again during the 2008 presidential campaign , when it was a subject of debate among Democratic candidates . Then -- New York Senator Hillary Clinton proposed an individual mandate as part of her plan . Then-candidate Obama proposed a mandate requiring parents to make certain their children were covered , but said an individual mandate was not part of his initial plan . However , he said an individual mandate could be considered following implementation of major health reform if it were deemed necessary to expand coverage . <p> In 2006 , Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to require all residents age 18 and older to have health insurance . The state also enacted several other measures to expand coverage in other ways and to facilitate compliance with the mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , includes these key provisions : <p> Residents must confirm on their state income tax forms that they have insurance , unless their incomes are such that they are deemed unable to obtain " affordable " coverage . The affordability levels are set each year by a newly created , independent , quasi-governmental agency called the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector . People with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty guideline ( FPG ) , or $16,245 for a single individual in 2010 , are considered to be unable to contribute anything towards premiums , so no penalty is imposed if they do not obtain coverage . A person whose income is 450 percent of poverty , or $54,600 , is deemed to be able to afford an annual premium of $4,104 -- about 8 percent of income . Hardship waivers are available for people whose income is sufficient to pay for coverage but who have other pressing financial needs . <p> The Connector also serves as an intermediary , helping individuals and small businesses acquire health coverage . The coverage must meet certain standards that , among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in policies . Through the Connector , individuals can qualify for state-subsidized health coverage or purchase private health insurance ; eligibility for subsidies , however , depends on their income levels , whether or not they have employer-sponsored coverage and their immigration status ( at present , neither legal or illegal immigrants qualify for subsidies ) . Offerings available through the Connector include new low-cost plans for 18-to-26-year-olds , with lower benefits , significant cost sharing , and annual benefit maximums as low as $50,000 . <p> Individuals who are subject to the requirement but do not comply must pay penalties equivalent to a portion of the costs of health insurance . In 2009 , the maximum penalty is $624 for 18-to-26 year-olds and $1,068 for those aged 27 and older . <p> The Massachusetts law has other features , including a requirement that employers with 11 or more workers either contribute to employees ' health insurance or pay a penalty . The individual mandate has been one reason that the uninsurance rate among nonelderly Massachusetts adults has fallen from an estimated 13 percent in 2006 to 3.5 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state is estimated to have risen to 97.4 percent in 2009 ) . In part , the mandate appears to have prompted more workers eligible for employer coverage to enroll in the coverage offered to them . In the second year of the mandate , 2008 , 1.1 percent of taxpayers paid a penalty rather than buy coverage . <p> A number of other states , including California , Maryland , Maine , and Washington , have also considered individual mandates but not adopted them . And several European countries have also enacted individual mandates , often in the context of major health reforms . Switzerland adopted an individual mandate in 1996 . Strict penalties enforced by the Swiss cantons , or provinces , are imposed on those who do not purchase health insurance for infants within three months of birth or after moving to Switzerland . The Swiss mandate has helped achieve a 99 percent compliance rate . The Netherlands in 2006 mandated that individuals purchase health insurance or face a penalty of 130 percent of premiums . Early reports from the first year of implementation suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's proposed ? <p> An individual mandate is a key component of legislative health reform proposals that have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate as this brief is published . But at the same time , a mandate is only one part of complex reform plans in which the various pieces are to a large extent interdependent . <p> For example , if policymakers decide there should be an individual mandate , they must also decide what type or amount of coverage people must have and must assure that this coverage is available to everyone subject to the mandate . What 's more , since not everyone will be able to afford the full costs of coverage , policymakers must decide what , if any , financial or other assistance will be available to help people buy it . There are also questions about what the penalties for not obtaining coverage will be , who will be exempt for financial or other reasons , and how the rules will be enforced . If penalties are imposed through the tax system , for example , people who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The following is a description of how these issues are addressed in the House bill , the Affordable Health Care for America Act ( H.R. 3962 ) , and the Senate bill , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . ( The Senate proposal was passed as an amendment to an unrelated House-passed tax bill , H.R. 3590 . ) <p> Basic requirement and definition of acceptable coverage : The two bills require all legal residents -- with exceptions to be described below -- to have coverage meeting minimum standards . The two bills include broad definitions of " essential benefits " for individual insurance coverage , with details to be set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services . The House-defined minimum policy would cover 70% of costs for these benefits , compared to 60% in the Senate bill . Remaining costs would be paid by enrollees in the form of deductibles , copayments , or coinsurance . <p> People would comply with the mandate by buying coverage on their own or through an insurance exchange ; by enrolling in Medicare , Medicaid , or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an employment-based plan . A " grandfather " clause would let people who already have individual or employer coverage continue that coverage , even though it might not meet the new benefit standards . ( In the House bill , employers would have to meet the standards within five years . ) The mandate would take effect in 2013 in the House bill , and in 2014 in the Senate bill . <p> Exemptions : Both bills would exempt certain people from penalties for failing to comply with the mandate . These would include people for whom buying coverage would be a " financial hardship , " as explained more fully below ; people with religious objections to health coverage ; people not legally resident in the United States ; and those who only went without insurance coverage for short periods of time ( 3 months in the House bill but for an unspecified period in the Senate bill ) . The Senate bill also exempts anyone with income below 100% of the federal poverty level , although for the vast majority of such persons , coverage would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill would exempt children . <p> A key difference in the bills is the way that " hardship " is defined . The House leaves the definition to be set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and a new Health Choices Commissioner . This is similar to the approach adopted in Massachusetts , where the Massachusetts Connector Authority sets affordability standards each year . The Senate bill specifies that people would be exempt from the mandate if their required contribution for basic coverage was more than 8% of income . ( The required contribution is the amount a worker would have to pay for his or her employer 's plan , or the net premium after tax subsidies for the least expensive basic plan offered through an exchange . ) This percentage limit would increase if basic premiums grew faster than average personal income . <p> Penalty and enforcement : For people failing to obtain required coverage , the House bill would impose a tax equal to 2.5% of the amount by which a person or family 's modified adjusted gross income exceeds the income tax filing threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointly ) . If the rule were in effect today , a single person with income of $25,000 who failed to obtain coverage would pay a penalty of $391 ; someone with $50,000 in income would pay a penalty of $1,016 . The penalty could not exceed the national average premium for basic benefits in the insurance exchange . <p> The Senate bill would impose a penalty equal to the greater of a flat dollar amount for each person not covered in any family or a percentage of household income . The flat dollar penalty would begin at $95 in 2014 , would rise to $750 in 2016 , and then would be indexed for inflation using the Consumer Price Index . For uncovered children , half of the penalty would be imposed , and no family would pay more than three times the level of the individual penalty , or $2,250 in 2016 . The income-based penalty would begin at 0.5 percent of income in 2014 and rise to 2 percent in 2016 . As in the House bill , this income-based penalty could not exceed the national average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In both bills , the penalties would be prorated for people without coverage only for part of the year . <p> The bills would require health insurers , employers , and government insurance programs to report to the Internal Revenue Service each year on each person covered by an " acceptable " plan during the year , and on the period of time that this person was covered . The information would be used to determine which taxpayers were uncovered long enough to incur a penalty and whether the taxpayer appropriately calculated the penalty on his or her income tax return . People failing to pay the penalty would be subject to the usual procedures for collecting unpaid taxes , except that the Senate bill specifies that liens or criminal sanctions for tax evasion would not apply to the health insurance assessment . <p> Helping people meet the requirement : Both bills include measures intended to make health insurance available and affordable to more people . Insurers selling coverage to individuals and small groups , whether that coverage were sold through or outside of an exchange , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit benefits on the basis of pre-existing conditions ; could not vary premium rates according to enrollees ' health status ; and could vary premiums by age by only a specified amount . More low-income people would be eligible for Medicaid ; tax credits would be provided for the purchase of insurance through an exchange ; and most larger employers would be required to provide coverage or make payments on behalf of their workers , while smaller employers would receive assistance with the cost of providing coverage . ( These measures are described in detail in other Health Policy Briefs , including Coverage for Low-Income People , July 24 , 2009 ; and " Shared Responsibility , " August 13 , 2009 . ) <p> What 's the argument ? <p> In favor of an individual mandate : Supporters make two primary sets of arguments in favor of requiring most Americans to have health insurance . One set of arguments is primarily economic and market-oriented ; the other is primarily ethical and moral . <p> In the first category , supporters argue that an individual mandate is key to having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively as possible . Health insurance markets work best , they say , when everyone is insured . This is because the risk of high medical expenses for a relative few is spread among a large and diverse group of healthy people . These healthier individuals pay premiums regularly and may or may not be filing claims , in contrast to sicker enrollees who are filing claims regularly . In effect , premium dollars are shared across the healthy and sick alike . This is considered fair because , no matter what one 's health status is at a given moment , many if not most people will ultimately need some form of medical treatment . <p> Free riding and adverse selection : In the absence of a requirement to buy coverage , some healthy people tend not to buy it , believing that they wo n't need it if they are not sick . This is a phenomenon known as " free riding . " Because many of these people become i 'll and are treated anyway , the costs of their care are often shifted to insured populations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn lead to higher premiums . <p> As evidence of at least some population of " free riders , " some analysts point to the fact that according to the Census Bureau 's Current Population Survey , about 9.1 million people in households with incomes of $75,000 or more did not have coverage during 2007 . Presumably , many of these people could have found affordable coverage but had other priorities . <p> Other people may seek to buy coverage only after they become sick and expect to incur large medical expenses . This problem is known as " adverse selection . " If sick people are more likely to enroll , insurers must raise premiums to cover costs . Premium increases can in turn lead healthier people to drop coverage . In extreme cases , an insurer could fall into a " death spiral , " covering a steadily shrinking pool of very high-cost enrollees . Concern about adverse selection is one of the key reasons that insurers have adopted many of the restrictions that can close off coverage to people with medical problems . <p> With nearly everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pool , " insurers could eliminate such practices as " medical underwriting " that denies coverage or leads to dramatically higher premiums for sicker individuals ; " rescissions , " or cancellations of coverage , which sometimes occur after enrollees submit claims for previously undisclosed illness ; or specific exemptions written into some insurance policies that exclude coverage for treatment of " pre-existing " medical conditions . <p> In fact , the leading health insurance trade group , America 's Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) , has told both Congress and the White House that it will agree to new regulations barring these practices if the legislation also includes an individual mandate with a strict penalty . AHIP objected to the version of the penalties in the original Senate leadership proposal as insufficiently strict to induce many people to become insured . Citing a study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers , the group argued that the lenient penalties might lead people to delay getting coverage until they need services and that the resulting adverse selection could make the overall package of market reforms far less workable . AHIP has not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stringent penalties included in the final bill passed by the Senate . <p> Supporters further contend that an individual mandate would be reasonable because it would be accompanied by resources that would help individuals comply with it . Health insurance exchanges would make it easy for people to shop for coverage . Subsidies would be provided to millions to make coverage more affordable . Medicaid would be expanded to cover more low-income people who do n't currently qualify for the program . Many of those newly eligible would be exempt from the mandate because their income was below poverty ( under the Senate bill ) or the tax filing threshold ( under the House bill ) . <p> Finally , supporters expect that the individual mandate would affect only a minority of Americans who currently lack health insurance . Nearly three in five Americans under age 65 are already covered by employment-based health insurance ; senior citizens and the disabled already have Medicare ; and , as noted above , Medicaid expansion would cover many of the remaining uninsured people . <p> The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would drop from 17 percent in 2010 to 4 percent in 2016 under the House bill , and 6 percent under the Senate bill . The Senate bill would still leave about 23 million uninsured people , about a third of whom would be unauthorized immigrants . However , because of the exemptions for low-income people and those for whom coverage is unaffordable , only a fraction of the remaining uninsured would be subject to a tax penalty . <p> Against an individual mandate : A key argument against the requirement is that it would be an infringement by government on personal freedom . Opponents note that the government has never required people to buy a good or service as a condition of residence in the United States . Some also question whether Congress has the constitutional authority to impose a mandate and predict that , at minimum , a mandate would almost certainly face a legal challenge . ( This assertion is disputed by others , who say that the mandate merely constitutes an exercise of the power of the federal government under the Constitution to raise taxes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , has a lengthy preamble making the case for commerce clause authority . ) <p> Other opponents of an individual mandate say it 's simply unreasonable to compel people to buy insurance that they clearly consider unnecessary or less important than other things they want . Others contend that a mandate would be acceptable only if individuals could choose a public option -- the government-run insurance program that is included in the House bill but not in the Senate bill . In the absence of such an option , these people say , a mandate might amount to requiring people to contribute to private , for-profit entities . <p> Still others say that , in combination with other provisions of health reform , the mandate would be overly burdensome on many people . There are concerns that the subsidies proposed in various bills still wo n't be enough to make mandated health coverage affordable for many people . Under the House and Senate bills , the percentage of the premium paid by people eligible for a subsidy will stay constant in future years , but the dollar amount people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When income growth fails to keep pace with rising premiums , people will be compelled to spend more and more of their income to comply with the mandate . <p> Even at the outset , requiring some moderate-income people to spend as much as 12.8 percent of their incomes on health coverage , as the bills under consideration would do , is simply unfair , these opponents of a mandate contend . ( By contrast , in Massachusetts , a person earning $54,000 would be required to spend out of pocket only 7.5 percent of his or her income on health care . ) Others worry that when the required benefit package was ultimately established , it 's likely the benefits would be generous and the cost of the package high . Furthermore , opponents argue that even if the mandate were initially linked to a basic , low-cost plan , there would be constant pressure to expand the scope of benefits . <p> There are also questions about how an individual mandate for a minimum benefit package would be implemented , since health care costs and utilization vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fair to require the same amount of insurance nationwide when the cost is not the same . <p> Questioning the need for a mandate : Some experts do n't necessarily oppose an individual mandate , but they question the need for it , depending on other provisions of health reform legislation . If insurance in a reformed system represented a " good buy " for people , they say , a mandate would not be necessary , because most people would elect to buy coverage . Whether or not insurance was such a good buy , with reasonable costs for good benefits , would depend on many other rules set forth in health reform -- for example , how much insurers could charge different groups of people based on their age , or whether or not young adults could buy just catastrophic plans . One way to proceed , these experts say , would be to reform health insurance first , then wait to see if enough people enrolled so that a mandate was n't necessary . <p> Other experts who are skeptical of a mandate point to inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administer . In Massachusetts , for example , there are those who want a mandate , rich subsidies , and low required benefits , and on the other side , those who want a mandate , a generous benefit package , generous subsidies and a willingness to exempt more people from the mandate . These kinds of trade-offs might not be easy to resolve , and they could make an individual mandate extremely hard to maintain over the long haul . <p> Finally , some outright opponents of a mandate voice skepticism that it could be enforced . Auto insurance is mandatory in 47 states , although it is enforced only through license renewal and registrations , not through the tax code as an individual health insurance mandate would be . Still , the median number of uninsured drivers in those states is 12 percent . <p> What 's next ? <p> As this brief is published , the fate of health reform legislation is unclear -- as is the fate of the individual mandate proposal . The House and Senate have passed different bills , each including a mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation ; rather , House leaders have signaled that they will work to amend the Senate bill somewhat and then pass the new version through the House . That version would then go to the Senate for its approval . It 's probable that a mandate would be included in that final version . However , many other provisions affecting the mandate could change , including the size and scope of the affordability credit and the penalties for noncompliance . The conference report would then have to be passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the president . In short , whatever emerges from the process may in fact be different from the proposals discussed in this brief .

We would very much appreciate if you could complete our site survey so that we may gain from your experiences and ensure that our future plans and enhancements target your specific needs . <h> Abstract <p> Patients designated as alternative level of care ( ALC ) are an ongoing concern for healthcare policy makers across Canada . These patients occupy valuable hospital beds and limit access to acute care services . The objective of this paper is to present policy alternatives to address underlying factors associated with ALC bed use . Three alternatives , and their respective limitations and structural challenges , are discussed . Potential solutions may require a mix of policy options proposed here . <p> Inadequate policy jeopardizes new acute care activity-based funding schemes in British Columbia and Ontario . Failure to address this issue could exacerbate pressures on the existing bottlenecks in the community care system in these and other provinces . <p> Some vulnerable canadians are experiencing difficulty in accessing acute care on a timely basis . Lengthy wait times for hospital admission from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News 2011 ; CTV News 2011 ) , while surgical wait times outside those procedures prioritized by federal incentive programs have generally increased ( CIHI 2012 ) . <p> These long delays for accessing hospital beds are occurring in spite of significant increases in hospital spending . The five-year average rate of hospital expenditure growth has increased by 5.9% ( CIHI 2010a ) . Meanwhile , the number of same-day surgical procedures increased 30% , from 1.3 million to 1.8 million , from 1995/96 to 2005/06 ( CIHI 2007 ) . Based on these trends , one would expect reduced pressures on hospital beds ; but instead , planners are left questioning why some Canadians have significant problems accessing hospital-based services . <p> Hospital beds are the " choke points " in the system ; with a fixed number of beds , they limit the number of admissions and regulate access to hospital-based services . According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information , there are approximately 57,000 hospital beds in Canada ( excluding Quebec ) ( CIHI 2011a ) . Within Quebec , another 15,999 beds are designated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute care beds ) ( Quebec Databank of Official Statistics 2011 ) . Digging deeper , current estimates report that 13% of Canadian beds are occupied by patients who no longer require the intensity of care provided by acute care hospitals and are awaiting formal discharge ( CIHI 2010b ) . That is , approximately 7,500 hospital beds , every day , are occupied by patients who could be safely discharged elsewhere . <p> Unfortunately , having patients waiting for discharge from hospital is so common in Canada that there is a term for it " alternative level of care , " or ALC . Though these patients have been approved for discharge by their physician , they can not access the appropriate post-acute care for their condition ( CIHI 2009 ) . ALC represents an inefficient use of hospital resources these patients are occupying beds , staff time and equipment that could otherwise be used by patients waiting in the emergency department or those who have had their surgeries postponed . Yet , hospitals can not be held solely responsible for this inefficient use of resources and funding ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to the gridlock in hospitals . Thus , a quick resolution to accessing hospital beds lies beyond our grasp if there is nowhere for patients " stuck " in hospitals to safely go . <p> The high prevalence of ALC bed use puts recent healthcare reforms at risk . British Columbia and Ontario have recently made changes to the way they fund hospital-based care , moving away from global budgets towards partially funding hospitals for their patients ( i.e. , activity-based funding ) . These policies , as the evidence shows , have the potential to shorten lengths of stay and increase hospital activity ( O'Reilly et al . 2012 ) . Yet , without complementary policies for post-acute care , the intended effect of increased activity in hospitals may not occur . The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the key structural challenges to reducing the impact of ALC patients on Canadian hospitals and to propose policy alternatives that could free hospital beds . <h> Hospital Bed Use : The Case of Alternative Level of Care <p> What do we know about ALC patients ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are eventually discharged to facility-based post-acute care ( CIHI 2010b ) . The remainder of patients are discharged to assisted living or to their homes ( with or without support ) . Over 35% of ALC patients are 85 years or older , and nearly a quarter of ALC patients have been diagnosed with dementia ( CIHI 2011b ) . <p> In terms of resources , ALC patients consumed the equivalent of 2.4 million hospital days over the course of fiscal year 2008/09 ; the equivalent of approximately 7,500 beds are occupied by a patient designated as ALC on any given day ( CIHI 2010b ) . On average , one ALC patient occupying a bed in the emergency department denies access to four patients per hour to that emergency department ( Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians 2005 ) . <p> We also know that waiting in hospital for post-acute care prolongs patients ' exposure to an environment that experiences thousands of avoidable adverse events each year ( Baker et al . 2004 ) . Moreover , delays in discharges , particularly for frail geriatric patients , can lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or necessitating premature admission to long-term care ( Canadian Healthcare Association 2009 ) . <h> The Build More Option <p> An obvious solution to improving access to hospital beds is to expand acute care capacity . The additional beds would allow a greater number of admissions from the emergency department or for surgery . Optimistically , increasing capacity would improve access to acute care and shorten elective surgery wait times . <p> The reality is that a " build more " approach is a temporary , and costly , fix . Without addressing the underlying problem of safely transitioning patients to post-acute care in a timely manner , this approach could lead to more beds being occupied by ALC patients , exacerbating the current problem . <h> Can the build more option be redefined ? <p> Expanding post-acute care capacity is another " build more " solution . Under this option , provincial governments would further increase healthcare spending by expanding post-acute care capacity ( in its current form , with a mix of public and private providers ) . The obvious benefit of this policy option is that current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital beds and facilitating more hospital admissions . <p> Like building more hospital beds , this option also faces considerable challenges . First , to expand post-acute care capacity effectively , policy makers would be required simultaneously to identify the post-acute care type currently in the most need ( i.e. , the care needs of current ALC patients ) without over- or under-investing for the needs of future ALC patients . <p> Further challenges to this option include the lack of strong clinical evidence supporting the appropriateness of post-acute care . Recent research in the United States demonstrates how funding policies , not necessarily the care needs of patients , alter the type of post-acute care a patient receives , and clear clinical guidelines for post-acute care settings are often lacking ( Buntin et al . 2009 ) . <p> The reality is that healthcare budgets are under considerable strain , and " build more " options would be less unpalatable if capital funds were easily available . However , in this environment of restraint , expanding acute or post-acute capacity is an expensive experiment with no guarantee of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALC patients is another indicator of the need for more integrated care , as closer relationships between acute and post-acute care providers have been posited as a way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare resource use ( Ham et al . 2011 ; Vedel et al . 2011 ) and reduce failures of transitional care between settings . Integrated healthcare delivery may produce pressures to minimize the number of ALC patients , because integrated models can have either the administrative authority or the financial incentives ( or both ) to ensure that patients are treated at the lowest-cost provider appropriate for their condition ( Robertson et al . 2004 ) . <p> Integrating care across provider types was one of the motivations behind the regionalization of many provincial healthcare systems ( Hurley 2004 ) . To date , however , regionalization has fallen well short of this goal . Regional authorities have failed to promote clinical guidelines to coordinate care across settings , invest in integrated information technology systems , address unwarranted variations in the utilization of healthcare services , leverage non-physician healthcare professionals , or disseminate efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impair the integration of healthcare providers ( Leatt et al . 2000 ) . Or , the regional authorities have been unable to resolve policy conflicts among providers beyond their control , such as physicians ( Simpson 2011 ) . <h> Barriers to the integrated care option <p> Cited examples of effective integrated care models are largely based in the United States , such as the Kaiser Permanente and Geisinger Health systems . These systems are privately operated , often with salaried physicians , and have tightly networked their funding and delivery arms . The results from these systems are likely not generalizable to the Canadian setting , where physicians are remunerated by a third party ( i.e. , the province ) , are rewarded for how " much " they do , and whose costs are externalized from the effects of inefficient hospital care . In addition , many post-acute care providers are privately owned and do not share hospitals ' community-based mission . As well , the penetration of cross-continuum electronic medical records remains poor ( McGrail et al . 2010 ) . <p> One model from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly ( PACE ) . Under this program , organizations develop an integrated program of care for those 55 and older who have complex needs and where care is provided in the community , rather than in a nursing home . PACE providers receive a capitated monthly payment for each patient they care for ; thus , they have a financial incentive to keep patients out of hospital . Evaluations of the PACE model have reported significant reductions in hospital utilization and improved quality of care ( Beauchamp et al . 2008 ; Meret-Hanke 2011 ) . <p> A project similar to PACE was piloted in Quebec , raising the prospect of integrated models of care in Canada ( BTland et al . 2006 ) . The SIPA ( Services intTgrTs pour les personnes GgTes en perte d'autonomie ) project used a randomized control trial to evaluate the performance of community-based multidisciplinary teams integrated across health and social services compared to usual care . Costs of community-based services were higher for the integrated care group compared to the usual care group , but facility-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 50% reduction in ALC occupancy . <p> While the PACE and SIPA programs offer a potential model for integrated care , there are several limitations to their broader implementation . First , the scope of these programs extends beyond healthcare into social services , assisting patients in finding work and affordable housing , and in navigating government programs . Second , both the PACE and SIPA programs have policies in place to align incentives of providers with integrated models of care . They both offer their participating providers a capitated payment on a per-patient basis , intended to cover the extra cost associated with integrated care models ( e.g. , developing care plans , communicating with other providers on patient care , following up with referrals ) . <h> The Financial Incentives Option <p> Creating financial incentives for improving the quantity , quality or effectiveness of healthcare is not the norm in Canadian provinces , as it is frequently associated with private , for-profit care . However , there is an abundance of evidence from other countries including ones with strong , publicly funded healthcare systems , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that healthcare institutions respond to financial incentives ( Street and Maynard 2007 ) . <p> Hospitals across Canada have historically been funded by way of a global budget ( Sutherland 2011 ) . A global budget is a single payment intended to fund all care over a given period , irrespective of the volume or type of care provided . Similarly , post-acute care tends to be funded through a global budget ( though recent changes in Alberta and Ontario 's long-term care sector are the exception ) , independent of hospital expenditures . Global budgets create incentives for cost controls , and the policy leaves the hospital or post-acute care providers at risk for changes in volume or complexity of patients . <p> Recently introduced activity-based funding initiatives targeting hospitals in British Columbia and Ontario are creating incentives for hospitals to " push " patients from acute care ( because new admissions generate additional revenue ) . These incentives are expected to put increased pressure on limited post-acute care capacities as a result of hospitals ' ( presumed ) increase in activity . <p> Similar financial incentives could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give these providers the ability to create capacity for ALC patients . <h> Barriers to the financial incentives option <p> Creating financial incentives for post-acute care may be a viable strategy that complements policies encouraging hospitals to increase the volume of care , and this approach targets the post-acute care needs of patients . British Columbia is already experimenting with financial incentives for community-based programs ( BC Health Services Purchasing Organization 2011 ) . But these policies necessitate careful surveillance of timely and reliable data on quality to ensure that patients are not discharged from hospitals too early or being cared for in an inappropriate setting . Such surveillance would require linking clinical practice guidelines to current patterns of care something that is sorely lacking in post-acute care across the country ( Buntin et al . 2009 ) . <p> Introducing new funding policies for post-acute care would also have to include mechanisms to ensure that post-acute care providers were not " cream skimming , " that is , admitting only those patients who are less costly ( than the payment amount ) to care for , or refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be avoided by risk-adjusting payments based on the clinical complexity or care needs of the patient . <h> Discussion <p> High ALC use is a significant barrier to effective use of costly hospital care a problem that hospitals have largely failed to address over the past decade . The most cost-effective approaches to improving access to hospital beds involve using the bed capacity we have now in a more efficient manner . However , reducing ALC will increase the number of hospitalizations for the same number of beds , challenging fiscal constraints by freeing new bed capacity . <p> Reducing ALC will cost the healthcare system real money , whether it is done by building more capacity , integrating providers or developing financial incentives . System-level savings will be realized only by re-tasking hospital beds as long-term care beds or closing a share of hospital beds and reallocating the funds to other sectors . <p> Yet , the risk of doing nothing is also expensive . Current activity-based funding policies ' singular focus on hospitals , without commensurate changes in post-acute care , jeopardizes the viability of these policies by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed three policy options building more , integrated care and financial incentives that offer potential solutions . These are not intended to be presented as either/or options ; given the complexity of the problem , a solution may well involve a combination of all three . <p> These three options address how policy makers might alleviate current ALC . However , this paper does not address the complementary issue of reducing " future " ALC ( such as by expanding primary care , improving the continuity of care and reducing avoidable hospital admissions ) , a topic that requires further linkages between community and secondary care providers . <p> Improving access to hospital care and reducing wait times are important goals for many Canadians , yet our current methods for funding care may be inhibiting our ability to realize those goals . Hospitals and post-acute care providers are known to respond to financial incentives . Let 's use this knowledge to explore whether financial incentives could improve access to hospital-based care and expand post-acute care in a way that responds to patients ' medical and social needs . <h> Acknowledgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quality Ontario ( HQO ) and Nadya Repin of CHSPR that improved this paper .

The study of the reorganization is based mainly on qualitative data from individual and focus group interviews . <p> Results : - The new organization of the university hospital can be regarded as a matrix structure combining a vertical integration of clinical departments with a horizontal integration of patient flows . This structure has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on teamwork , meetings and information exchange is combined with elements of case management and co-location . <p> Conclusions : - It seems that integrated care can be a relevant concept for a hospital . Although the organizational models may challenge established professional boundaries and financial control systems , this concept can be a more promising way to improve the quality of care than the industrial models that have been imported into health care . This application of the concept may also contribute to widen the field of integrated care . <h> Background and aim <p> Process orientation has become something of a fashion in health care . It has been inspired by the ideas of New Public Management , which means an application of management methods from the private sector in the organizations of the public sector in order to improve their efficiency 1 , 2 . In health care , as a result of New Public Management , artificial markets have been created through purchaser " provider split and commissioning of services 3 . In addition , many hospitals have applied concepts of process improvement from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business process reengineering 4 , 5 . <p> As part of this development , a number of industrial models of quality management have been translated to health care settings and used for process improvement , mainly in hospitals 6 , 7 . Based on a systems approach , these models are concerned with measuring the time and costs of different processes in an organization in order to identify obstacles and reduce waste of resources . The most popular model at the moment seems to be Lean Production , which has been imported from the Japanese car manufacturing industry 8 . In Sweden , for example , 9 out of 10 hospitals claim that they have applied this model to some extent 9 . It is not clear , however , what results the application of this model has actually achieved . It is difficult to evaluate the effects of management models . Instead , there has been a discussion for many years about the merits and risks of management fashions in health care 10 , 11 . <p> At the same time as the application of industrial models in hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care . This development has taken place within the health sector and it has been supported by the World Health Organization . Starting from the Ottawa Charter of Health Promotion 12 and the World Health Report 13 , a concept of integrated care has been introduced in order to improve the quality and efficiency of health services . Integrated care has been defined as bringing together inputs , delivery , management and organization of services related to diagnosis , treatment , care , rehabilitation and health promotion in order to improve the access , quality , user satisfaction and efficiency of these services 14 . It has been described as a coherent set of methods and models on the funding , administrative , organizational , service delivery and clinical levels designed to create connectivity , alignment and collaboration within and between the cure and care sectors 15 . <p> The development of integrated care started in the fields of health promotion and primary health care , but the concept has also been applied in other fields of health and social care like care of the elderly , care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open psychiatric care and treatment of drug abuse . As a result , a number of process oriented models of integration have been developed for different diseases and patient or client groups , for example , shared care , integrated care pathways and chains of care 16 " 18 . Beside these more or less clinical models , there are also other professional , organizational and system models of integration 19 . In contrast to the industrial models of quality management , the models of integrated care are based mainly on experiences from the health sector of working across the boundaries of different medical specialties , different professions and different organizations dealing with the same group of patients or clients . <p> The industrial models and the models of integrated care have not only different origins , but they also represent different strategies of process orientation in health care . The industrial models are focusing on the measurement of time and costs of different health-related processes , while the models of integrated care are more concerned with the organization and management of patient care across professional and organizational boundaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concentrating on processes within an organization like for example a hospital , while the models of integrated care have an interorganizational as well as an intraorganizational perspective and sometimes even an intersectoral perspective , dealing with processes across many different organizations of health and welfare 20 . With this broad orientation , there has not been so much focus on hospitals " and they have been only partly involved " in the development of integrated care . <p> Against this background , the aim of the article is to discuss the relevance of integrated care for hospitals . The discussion is based upon a conceptual framework outlining a number of organizational models of integrated care on different levels of integration . It will be conducted against the background of preliminary data from a study of a Danish university hospital implementing a new organization for improving the patient flows of the hospital . <h> Conceptual framework <p> According to the definitions of integrated care mentioned above , an important part of this concept concerns the management and organization of health services in order to create connectivity , alignment and collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhance quality of care and quality of life , consumer satisfaction and system efficiency for patients 15 . Integration is in this connection defined as bringing together different activities and organizational units for the benefit of the patients . This means organizing processes as well as structures . Moreover , integration can be horizontal as well as vertical . Horizontal integration means linking health services on the same organizational level , while vertical integration brings together services operating on different levels of the health system 14 . <p> In the literature of institutional economics , integration has often been described in terms of markets and hierarchies 21 . Integration can be achieved either through the invisible hand ' of market competition or through the more visible hand of a management hierarchy 22 . The management hierarchy means a top-down coordination of different actors , while competition on a market leads to contractual relations between purchasers and providers . According to the literature of organization and management , there is also a third way to achieve integration , namely through networks . This means a more or less voluntary cooperation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background , integrated care implies a matrix way of organizing , combining the vertical integration of a management hierarchy with the horizontal integration of a network . This means , for example , organizing teams or projects across existing professional or organizational boundaries 25 , 26 . <p> As mentioned before , there are a number of process-oriented models of integrated care . In addition to the clinical models of shared care , integrated care pathways and chains of care , there are also models which are more specifically oriented towards the organization and management of integrated care . These models can be roughly divided into interprofessional and interorganizational models of integration : <p> The interprofessional models are dealing with integration of activities performed by different professionals or professional groups . These models include consultations and information exchange between professionals dealing with the same or similar patients 27 , 28 , more or less systematic meetings of different professionals involved in the treatment of a particular group of patients 29 , and work in multidisciplinary teams of professionals with complementary skills and knowledge 30 , 31 . <p> The interorganizational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units . Among these models are appointment of case managers for coordination of care on behalf of individual patients or patient groups 32 , formal agreements on collaboration or partnerships between organizations involved in the same treatments 33 , 34 , co-location of professionals or organizational units dealing with the same patient groups 35 and financial coordination or pooling of resources from different organizations or units for the benefit of the patients 36 , 37 . <p> The distinction between these different types of organizational models is not so sharp , but the interorganizational models are focusing mainly on an institutional ' level of integration , while the interprofessional models are more person centered ' 38 . This means that they are operating on different levels of integration . Many of these models are also complementary , which means that they can be used in different combinations . For example , consultations and information exchange can be combined with most of the other models of integrated care . In the same way , case management is often combined with interprofessional meetings and/or multidisciplinary teamwork . Partnerships between organizations may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Both the interprofessional and the interorganizational models may be more or less complex , depending on the number of organizational units and professionals involved . The complexity of the models may also be due to the intensity ' in contacts , relationships and modes of work 40 . The interprofessional models may be more or less formalized in standard programmes , guidelines and protocols . In the same way , the interorganizational models may be more or less formalized in agreements , contracts and other structural arrangements . Although the models thus have different degrees of complexity and formalization , there is not one optimal model of integration , or one optimal combination of such models , that can be applied everywhere . However , one model or combination of models may be more appropriate than others in a certain context , depending most of all on the needs of the patients or clients served but also on the differentiation and fragmentation of the institutional environment 20 . <h> A university hospital in transition <h> Context and methods <p> The Danish health care system is a public system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care is provided by approximately 3400 general practitioners and the 98 municipalities of the country . The general practitioners are family doctors who are paid on a combined capitation and fee-for-service basis . The municipalities are responsible for nursing homes and home care . They are also responsible for prevention , health promotion and rehabilitation . Secondary and tertiary care is provided by hospitals owned and run by the five regions of the country . There are four university hospitals in Denmark providing secondary and highly specialized tertiary care as well as medical education and research . <p> One of the university hospitals started in 2012 to reorganize its clinical structure in order to improve the quality of care from a patient perspective . The hospital is one of the largest employers in the region with approximately 6500 employees and it provides highly specialized care for 640,000 inhabitants and basic hospital functions for 250,000 inhabitants . The reorganization was focusing on the coordination of patient flows through the hospital . It was initiated by the board of the regional health administration in cooperation with the management board of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to introduce a new management structure at the department level of the university hospital and to develop a team structure at the ward , specialty and patient levels of each department . Another important part of the reorganization was to develop the links between the hospital and the primary sector , including the general practitioners and the social services of the local communities . Thus , the reorganization was aiming to improve patient flows not only within the university hospital but also between the hospital and the primary sector . <p> The reorganization of the university hospital has been followed during 2013 and 2014 by a group of organizational researchers ( the authors ) . The members of the group have made a number of interviews with professionals and managers from different clinical departments and different organizational levels within the hospital and also from the management board of the regional health administration . There were five interviews with the top management of the hospital and the regional administration and eight interviews with key persons involved in the reorganization process . In addition , there were two focus group interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the hospital . <p> All the interviews were semi-structured , focusing mainly on the interprofessional and interorganizational integration in the new organization . The data from the interviews were processed in accordance with qualitative methodology , which means that the interviews were transcribed , interpreted and analyzed with respect to their contents 41 . The interpretation and analysis of the data were made in the terms of the organizational models of the conceptual framework in order to illustrate these models . The interview data were also combined with data from observations of meetings and studies of documents like organizational diagrams , statistics and annual reports 42 . These data were also interpreted and analyzed in terms of the different organizational models of the conceptual framework . The following account of the reorganization is based on all of these data . <h> Results <p> The new organizational structure consists of eight clinical departments , each of them with a combination of medical specialties conducive to the main patient flows within the university hospital . This means that the clinical structure is crossing the boundaries of different medical specialties . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the centre of the organization by grouping specialists around the patients instead of sending the patients around to different specialists . Each clinical department is managed by a leadership troika consisting of a clinical director and two clinical vice directors ; one of them is responsible for the human resources while the other is responsible for the patient flows of the department . Five clinical directors are physicians , two are administrators and one is a nurse . All the vice directors responsible for human resources are nurses , while there are three physicians and six nurses who are vice directors responsible for patient flows . One of the clinical departments has two vice directors for the patient flows because of the size of the department . <p> There are three main innovations in this organization . The first innovation is a clinical structure with a creative combination of different medical specialties in order to facilitate the patient flows of the university hospital . Among these can be mentioned the head-ortho clinic ' with a combination of orthopaedics and different specialties of the head including neurology and neurosurgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paediatrics , gynaecology , obstetrics and urological surgery and the heart-lung clinic ' with a combination of pulmonary medicine , cardiology and thorax surgery . One of the clinical departments , the acute clinic ' , has an unusual combination of emergency care and geriatrics , but it is also responsible for the contacts between the hospital and the different organizations of the primary sector . The new clinical structure of the hospital is illustrated in Figure 1 . <p> The second innovation is the appointment of clinical vice directors responsible for patient flows . These so-called flow managers are responsible for coordinating the patient flows within their clinical departments and they are sharing the responsibility for coordinating patient flows across the boundaries of the different departments . They are also responsible for coordinating patient flows across the boundaries of the hospital and the primary sector . In this connection , the flow manager of the acute clinic ' has a special task to facilitate the contacts with the organizations of the primary sector . There has been a lively discussion within the hospital on whether the flow managers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were few physicians who applied . However , when the flow managers were going to be appointed , many physicians suddenly realized that they would be in a subordinate position to the nurses who had applied for the position . This has led to some opposition from the physicians and there is still a discussion going on concerning the role and the power of the flow managers in the new organization . <p> The third innovation is the strong focus on teamwork to support the patient flows of the hospital . The leadership troika at the department level is working as a management team , where the vice director responsible for patient flows has an important role . Within the clinical departments , there is also an ongoing development of interlocking teams on different levels . There are ward management teams ' , consisting of senior physicians and nurses in the role of ward managers , who are responsible for the wards and surgeries of the clinical departments . There are also professional teams ' of specialist physicians , nurses and other professionals who are working within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , members of these teams are participating as patient responsible physicians and nurses together with auxiliary personnel in patient teams ' , which are formed for the operational coordination of care around individual patients . It is in these teams that the improvement of the patient flows is taking place . The team structure at the department level of the university hospital is illustrated in Figure 2 . <p> In addition to these organizational innovations , a number of networks have been established to support the management structure of the new hospital organization . There are , for example , networks for the clinical directors and for the different vice directors . The network of the flow managers is meeting regularly to exchange information and discuss common problems in the coordination of the patient flows . There are also regular meetings between this network and members of the management board of the hospital for evaluation and planning of different activities to facilitate and improve the patient flows . There are still traditional systems of accounting and budgeting in the university hospital , which means that resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the top management of the hospital is well aware of the need to change these systems in order to implement the new organization and improve the patient flows of the hospital . <h> Discussion <p> The reorganization of the Danish university hospital has not been following the management fashion of many other hospitals to import industrial models of quality management focusing on measurement of time and costs . Instead the university hospital has been more concerned with the organization and management of patient care across professional and organizational boundaries . The new organization of the hospital contains many elements from the different models of integrated care . The whole organization is based on a matrix way of thinking , combining the horizontal integration of patient flows with the vertical integration of clinical departments . This is even more the case with patient flows across different departments or across the great divide between the hospital and the primary sector . At the same time , the combination of specialties within the departments can be regarded as a form of horizontal integration across the vertical integration of the traditional medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , a matrix organization can be an efficient way to integrate new activities or organizational units within a hierarchical structure , but it is also a complicated and fragile structure that may lead to confusion , stress and conflicts about leadership . This is particularly the case in a professional organization , like a hospital , where there are often boundary conflicts between different professions involved 43 , 44 . Therefore , the matrix structure needs to be supported by different liaison devices ' like task forces , standing committees or integrating managers 25 . Many of these devices are included in the different organizational models of integration . <p> There are elements of interprofessional as well as interorganizational integration in the new organization of the university hospital . There is a strong focus on teamwork on different levels of the organization . There are management teams on the department level and the ward level , which consist of managers with different professional backgrounds . In the clinical departments , there are multidisciplinary teams of professionals working within the different medical specialties of the departments or across these specialties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also members of other multidisciplinary teams , which are formed around individual patients or groups of patients . This means a complicated structure with overlapping or interlocking multidisciplinary teams , which contributes to the interprofessional as well as the interorganizational integration of the hospital 31 . <p> Despite the risk of professional boundary conflicts , the different management and multidisciplinary teams provide ample opportunities for consultations and information exchange between different managers and different professionals in the new hospital organization . In addition , a number of networks have been established for key management functions in the new organization . There are networks for the clinical directors and the different vice directors . Within these networks , there are regular meetings to exchange information and discuss common problems . There are also regular meetings between these networks and the hospital management . All of these meetings are important devices for the integration of the organization 27 . <p> The appointment of clinical vice directors responsible for patient flows is another integration device . These flow managers have an important role as integrating managers in the matrix organization of the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case managers for different patient groups . The flow managers are responsible for the coordination of patient flows within their respective clinical departments and between different departments of the hospital as well as between the hospital and the primary sector . They have a strategic responsibility for these patient flows , while the patient teams are responsible for the operational coordination of care around individual patients . It is a difficult task to coordinate the work of professionals , particularly when they are physicians with a legal responsibility for their patients . This task is made even more difficult by the resistance of the physicians to be managed by nurses as flow managers . Therefore , the coordination of patient flows involves negotiations with physicians as well as elimination of practical or administrative barriers and obstacles 45 . <p> There are no formal agreements on collaboration between the different clinical departments in the hospital organization , but such agreements may be necessary if the departments become stronger and more independent as organizational units . In the same way , it may be necessary to develop existing agreements with the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with patient flows that are stretching out to the primary health care and the social services of the local communities 34 . <p> There has been a development towards a co-location of different medical specialties within the clinical departments , but this development has not gone so far because of the limitations of the existing hospital buildings . The only department where all the specialties are co-located is the internal medicine clinic ' , which is placed in a separate hospital building . In a few years , however , the university hospital will be moving to new buildings and these buildings are being planned with the new hospital organization in mind . <p> The most far-reaching model of interorganizational integration is financial coordination . This means that resources from different organizations or organizational units are pooled in order to finance common activities or processes 36 , 37 . Such coordination may eliminate many barriers to collaboration and integration related to territoriality and competition for resources 46 . In the new hospital organization , this means that resources from the clinical departments could be coordinated to finance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since finance is a powerful incentive , it would contribute to strengthen the coordination of the patient flows . The hospital management is aware of the need to change the systems of accounting and budgeting in the hospital , but they have first concentrated on implementing the new organization structure . Maybe it would have been a better strategy to start with the financial control systems instead of trying to change them afterwards . <h> Concluding remarks <p> The description and discussion of the reorganization of the university hospital have shown that integrated care can be a relevant concept not only for health promotion and primary health care , where the concept was first developed , but also for a highly specialized hospital organization . The new organization of the Danish university hospital has been analyzed in terms of different organizational models of integrated care . From the analysis , it is clear that there are many elements of interprofessional integration in the new organization , for example , the strong focus on multidisciplinary teamwork and meetings , providing many opportunities for consultation and information exchange between professionals on different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of interorganizational integration , for example , the appointment of flow managers as a sort of case managers and the intentions to co-locate different specialties within the clinical departments . <p> The new organization was designed to improve the patient flows of the university hospital by grouping specialists around the patients instead of sending the patients around to different specialists . This means that the organization is oriented towards processes of care instead of the traditional orientation towards structures like clinical departments or medical specialties . Such a reorientation may challenge established professional identities and boundaries . The opposition from the physicians against the appointment of nurses as flow managers can be understood as a reaction against this reorientation . However , it can also be understood as a power struggle between two professional groups in the hospital . In any case , the opposition is hampering the implementation of the new organization . In addition , the implementation is made more difficult by the existing systems of accounting and budgeting , where the resources are allocated to the clinical departments rather than the patient flows . This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient flows . <p> Resistance to change is not surprising in a professional organization like a university hospital . The implementation of the new organization may therefore be an uphill battle before the role of the flow managers has been accepted and the financial control systems have become more process oriented . These are important questions for further research and development . It seems , however , that the design of the new organization is basically sound and in line with the organizational models of integrated care , which may contribute to improve the patient flows of the university hospital . As mentioned before , it is not clear what the fashionable industrial models of quality management have actually achieved in health care , so maybe the concept of integrated care is a more promising way to improve the quality of care than the industrial models of quality management . At the same time , the application of this concept in a university hospital may also contribute to widen the traditional field of integrated care . <p> Batalden , PB and Stoltz , PK ( 1993 ) . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building and applying professional and improvement knowledge to test changes in daily work. - The Joint Commission Journal on Quality Improvement 19(10) : 424 " 47 . <p> Berwick , DM ( 1996 ) . - A primer on leading the improvement of systems. - British Medical Journal 312 : 619 " 22.

Every decision to order a diagnostic test , prescribe a therapy , or request a consultation from a specialist , each with the goal of improving or maintaining patient health , inevitably reduces the pool of available health care funds . However , while physicians specialize in understanding the safety and effectiveness of tests and treatments , most have less experience assessing the costs and economic implications . This task has traditionally fallen to government policy makers and health care payors . <p> Figure 1 depicts a hierarchical model of primary care physician payment with increasing levels of responsibility for resource allocation . As the model of primary care payment changes , practices are gaining additional responsibility for deciding how resources should be allocated across groups of patients . It is therefore becoming increasingly important for primary care physicians to develop a systematic approach to health care priority setting , including assessing the costs and benefits of interventions . If Medicare is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depending on the specific financial reimbursement arrangement , primary care physicians might have more or less direct responsibility for resource allocation . For example , in Canada , physicians do not have a financial stake in the reimbursement of laboratory tests , the cost being borne by the health care system ( although it should be acknowledged that the use of these resources will indirectly affect the amount of funds available for other health care programs or interventions ) . On the other hand , physician groups who have the responsibility of overseeing the allocation of health care funds , as in the examples noted above , are faced with deciding which health care programs to implement for their patient populations , often within fixed budgets . For example , a physician group might wish to provide after-hours care , chronic disease case management , and lifestyle modification programs , but the members find that they do not have enough funds to cover all 3 . Alternatively , they might have a specific objective and type of program in mind , such as diabetes education , but are faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource intensity . In either case , they will have to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each , as well as the costs , in order to determine how best to allocate scarce resources . <p> While political and personal considerations will always enter into the decision-making process around health care resource allocation , economic theory can provide a framework within which decision makers , including primary care physicians , can prioritize spending . In this paper we present an overview of the methods of economic evaluation in health care , using examples of studies applicable to primary care . To better illustrate the relevance of economic evaluation to primary care practice , we use Alberta 's PCNs as a case study . <h> Sources of information <p> The main concepts discussed in this article were derived from expert opinion and substantiated with well respected textbooks and comprehensive Canadian guidelines . Examples of cost-effectiveness estimates were taken from the published literature . <h> Case study : PCNs <p> In Alberta , primary care reform has taken the form of PCNs , an example of a primary care model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their patients outside the usual fee-for-service model ( Figure 1 ) .6 Approximately 80% of eligible family physicians in Alberta currently participate in PCNs.6 Additional funding of $50 per enrolled patient per year ( increased to $62 as of April 2012 ) is provided to PCNs to support activities that fall outside the typical physician-based fee-for-service model , but which are in accordance with specified objectives : improving access to primary care , increasing the emphasis on health promotion and disease management , and improving coordination of care.6 Consequently , a hypothetical group of 20 family doctors , each caring for an average of 1200 rostered patients , will be allocated $1.2 million in additional funds annually . <p> Although these additional funds are substantial , they are not enough to support every foreseeable initiative , and budget overruns are not covered by provincial health ministries . Therefore , PCNs are faced with deciding how to efficiently allocate these additional resources to best meet the needs of their patients , considering the priorities laid out by the province . Among other factors , consideration must be given to the populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of priorities has been identified , the next step is to decide which specific initiatives will produce the best results within the budget . Broadly speaking , then , one of the important objectives for a PCN is to maximize the health gains for its patient population using a fixed sum of money . This can be accomplished through a systematic comparison of the relative costs and health effects of candidate programs " economic evaluation . <h> Main message <h> Basic concepts of economic evaluation <p> Economic evaluation can be defined as the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and their consequences.7 For health care programs , costs are the monetary inputs required to fund the program , and consequences are the health effects , both positive and negative , that occur as a result of the program . Two important concepts are fundamental to economic evaluation : opportunity cost and efficiency . Opportunity cost is based on the principles of scarcity and choice . Given scarcity ( ie , not enough resources exist to meet all the desires of a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of health care , these choices include which health care programs to implement and which to forego . The opportunity costs of health care programs are the benefits associated with those programs that are not chosen . <p> In health care , efficiency is a measure of how much health benefit is produced for a given cost . In health economics , 2 types of efficiency are often considered : technical and allocative efficiency . Technical efficiency measures the extent to which health outcomes in a specific group of patients are maximized with a given set of resources . On the other hand , allocative efficiency attempts to maximize health outcomes across different patient populations by choosing between programs that use a variety of inputs . Knowing whether you are asking a question of technical or allocative efficiency aids in selection of the correct economic evaluation . <h> Types of economic evaluation <p> Economic evaluations can be classified into 3 broad categories : cost-effectiveness studies , cost-utility studies , and cost-benefit studies . All 3 consider costs in a similar fashion , but each differs in how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are outlined briefly below . <p> Cost-effectiveness analysis : In cost-effectiveness analysis , which can be used to address technical efficiency , health outcomes are measured in naturally occurring units such as units of blood pressure reduction , life-years gained , or deaths avoided . The specific outcome chosen will depend on the purpose of the intervention , and comparisons can only be made among interventions that can be measured in terms of the same health outcomes for similar populations of patients . <p> Costs and health effects are summarized in a cost-effectiveness ratio , a measure of the cost per unit of health effect . For example , Sekhar et al conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of screening healthy children to detect cases of chronic kidney disease using urine dipsticks . Using observational cohort data , they determined the cost per case of chronic kidney disease detected , noting that 800 children would have to be screened at a cost of $2779.50 ( US ) for 1 case to be detected.8 <p> Cost-minimization analysis is a special case of cost-effectiveness analysis in which the health outcomes of 1 or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem to one of determining which intervention is least costly . Cost-minimization analyses should be viewed with caution , however , as it is rare that any 2 technologies will have the exact same clinical effect.7 <p> Cost-utility analysis : When the goal is to maximize health outcomes across a population , an example of allocative efficiency , comparisons might need to be made between programs that target different patient groups . For example , if resources were limited , it might be necessary to compare a program for monitoring international normalized ratio for patients with atrial fibrillation with a program for diabetes case management . The goal of the first program is a reduction in the overall number of strokes , while that of the second is a reduction in diabetes complications . While the health outcomes of interest vary across these 2 programs , they can each be translated into life expectancy and quality of life , and their costs can be expressed in monetary units , allowing the programs to be compared on a common scale . <p> Cost-utility analysis enables comparison across different health outcomes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly used being the quality-adjusted life-year ( QALY ) . Quality-adjusted life-years incorporate the preferences that are placed on health outcomes by weighting the length of life by its quality . Utility scores range from 0 , for a state equivalent to death , to 1 , for a state equivalent to perfect health . Translating health outcomes into QALYs serves 2 important functions . First , it provides a common scale on which to measure disparate health outcomes . Second , it allows the evaluator to take into account the values that individuals and society place on health outcomes . <p> Results of cost-utility analyses are reported as the cost per QALY gained . For example , Cameron et al studied the cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes managed without insulin , and found that , compared with no self-monitoring , self-monitoring was associated with a cost per QALY gained of $113 643.9 <p> Cost-benefit analysis : Like cost-utility analysis , cost-benefit analysis also aims to incorporate the value that society places on different health outcomes ; however , cost-benefit analysis values health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the health benefits of a program is higher than its cost , the program is said to be cost-effective . Cost-benefit analysis can be thought of as somewhat broader in scope , as it can be used to estimate the effect of a program on both health and nonhealth benefits ( eg , convenience and other factors ) . However , given the challenges associated with the methodology currently used to elicit monetary values for health outcomes , studies using this strategy are less commonly found in the literature . Further details are available elsewhere.7 <h> Common elements in all economic evaluations <p> There are several basic elements common to cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies that the critical reader should consider when interpreting an economic analysis . These details allow the reader to determine whether the analysis applies to his or her patient population and scope of practice . Key elements of economic evaluations are detailed in Table 1.7,10,11Table 2 illustrates their use within a recent economic evaluation of blood glucose self-monitoring for patients with type 2 diabetes not using insulin.9,10,12 <p> Economic evaluation of blood glucose self-monitoring in patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be conducted alongside clinical trials or using decision analysis . Often , the 2 approaches are used together . When an analysis is done alongside a clinical trial , the costs and consequences incurred and measured during the trial are used as the data inputs for the economic study . When decision analysis is used , a representative model of the events of interest is constructed , and data from multiple sources , including extrapolation from clinical trials , are used to derive model inputs . Decision analysis is particularly useful for therapies for chronic conditions , in which the applicable time horizon extends beyond the duration of clinical trials , often to the lifetime of the patient . <h> Interpreting the results of economic evaluations <p> There are 4 broad categories that an intervention , relative to its comparator , can fall into : A ) more costly and more effective ; B ) less costly and more effective ; C ) less costly and less effective ; and D ) more costly and less effective ( Figure 2 ) . <p> Clearly , interventions that fall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both improvements in health and real cost savings . For example , Khazeni et al estimated that vaccinating 40% of the population against pandemic influenza ( H1N1 ) in October or November of 2009 would not only save lives but would also save nearly $400 million ( US ) .13 For the exact opposite reason , interventions in category D should not be implemented . <p> When faced with interventions that fall into categories A and C , the ultimate question for decision makers is whether therapies associated with additional costs are an efficient use of health care resources . Most interventions studied fall into category A ; they lead to gains in health but require additional resources . An intervention that falls into category C leads one to ask if sacrifices in health are worth the savings that would be garnered and potentially reinvested in other health-producing activities . <p> With respect to interventions in category A , in cost-utility analysis , the incremental cost-utility ratio , commonly referred to as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) , is the amount of additional resources that would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 QALY . Interventions that can purchase QALYs at a lower rate are deemed more attractive . The ICERs for commonly used interventions are shown in Table 3.9,14 " 18 <p> Using ICERs for commonly used interventions as a benchmark , some guidelines suggest that all interventions with a cost-utility ratio below a particular threshold should be deemed cost-effective and appropriate for adoption . For instance , Laupacis et al suggest that , in Canada , a cost-utility ratio less than $20 000 per QALY gained should provide strong evidence for adoption and appropriate use , a ratio between $20 000 and $100 000 per QALY gained provides moderate evidence for adoption and appropriate use , and a ratio greater than $100 000 per QALY gained provides only weak evidence for adoption.19 The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence program currently uses a threshold of -30 000 per QALY.20 <p> In the study by Cameron et al9 described in Table 2,9,10,12 the cost-utility ratio for self-monitoring of blood glucose was found to be $113 643 per QALY , a value that varied little across the subgroups . Based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 per QALY or $100 000 per QALY , the authors stated that self-monitoring for blood glucose in stable patients with type 2 diabetes not using insulin was not likely to be an efficient use of health care resources.9 <p> Although the use of cost-effectiveness thresholds provides a relatively clean approach , it does not fully address the issue of opportunity cost . Critics have suggested that such an approach could lead to escalating expenditures without regard to where the additional health care resources would come from.21 Unless funds are diverted from other programs , the continual addition of interventions with positive ICERs , even if they fall below a given threshold , will inevitably lead to higher total health care expenditures . Because health care budgets are not limitless , the implementation of some interventions will incur an opportunity cost . Therefore , decision makers must look past the individual cost-utility ratio and assess the costs and benefits of each program relative to others . <h> Other important inputs into resource allocation decisions <p> Although the cost-effectiveness of interventions is an important piece of information to consider , cost-utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be considered when making resource allocation decisions . For instance , treatments of rare or difficult-to-treat diseases or care of vulnerable populations might not meet arbitrary cost-effectiveness criteria but might still be desirable for reasons of inclusivity and equity . Other factors to consider include burden of disease , availability of alternative treatments , and uncertainty in the available evidence . We are unable to adequately address each of these in detail , and readers who are interested in learning more about how these factors can affect the use of economic evaluations in practice are referred elsewhere.7 <h> Primary care network case study <p> Returning to our case study , care of patients with diabetes was noted to be a priority for nearly all PCNs in Alberta . Consequently , these PCNs each committed a portion of their patient care budget to improving care for patients with diabetes , typically through establishment of multidisciplinary chronic disease management ( CDM ) programs.22 However , CDM programs for patients with diabetes , which can be categorized by the method used ( Table 4 ) , 22,23 vary by relative effectiveness23 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal situation for the use of economic evaluation . <p> Future implementation of CDM programs , with the view to optimizing the mix of CDM programs for each PCN , could be facilitated through a systematic review of the clinical data and the use of economic evaluation . Among patient groups for whom several different CDM programs are possible , economic evaluation could be used to determine the expected costs and benefits for each of the candidate programs . Examples of clinical and cost inputs that might be relevant for such an economic evaluation are listed in Table 5 . This list is not exhaustive and inputs will vary depending on the types of CDMs being compared , the type of economic evaluation ( ie , cost-effectiveness vs cost-utility ) , and the data available . The results of an economic evaluation could then be used to aid in the selection of 1 or more CDM programs that fit the budget and style of a practice , while maximizing health benefits . <p> The selection of a CDM program is but 1 example of how economic evaluation can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for allocating resources grows , the principles of economic analysis will become increasingly important . <h> Conclusion <p> Taking into account the stresses on Canadian Medicare , including the opposing forces of a constrained health care budget and the steady advances in health care technology , the importance of incorporating economic information into health care decision making is evident . Moreover , in view of the changes that are occurring in primary care across the globe , economic evaluations are likely to become more relevant for policy makers and primary care practitioners alike . We have described the basic principles of economic evaluation and provided an introduction to its interpretation . Armed with a basic understanding of health economics , primary care practitioners can begin to incorporate economic data , including that from economic evaluations when they are available , into the care plans of their individual patients and , for those managing budgets , their practices on the whole . <h> Acknowledgments <h> Notes <h> EDITOR 'S KEY POINTS <p> Primary care physicians have traditionally played an indirect role in the allocation of health care resources , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for deciding how health care funds are spent . <p> Given the emergence of new primary care payment models that have accompanied health care reform , the balance of responsibility for resource allocation is beginning to shift toward primary care practices . It is therefore becoming important for primary care physicians to develop a systematic approach to health care priority setting , including assessing the costs and benefits of interventions . Economic evaluation provides a framework within which these costs and benefits can be assessed objectively .

Because many of these measures have been not been extensively validated in general populations , assess limited aspects of the referral process , and require new data collection , their applicability and preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Keywords <h> Background <p> Access to specialty care in developed countries occurs mainly through primary care referrals 1 . Specialists provide important services related to resolution of clinical uncertainty , provision of long-term medical therapy for patients with unusual or complex medical problems , and provision of specialized technologies 2 , 3 . Nonetheless , a clear consensus on the availability and role of specialists is lacking , which likely contributes to the marked variation in use of specialty care across regions and countries 4 . <p> The optimal availability of specialty care has been a long-standing matter of contentious debate 5 . Workforce models that extrapolate current levels of specialist utilization while accounting for demographic trends project an impending shortage , particularly in the U.S 6 . These models assume that current demand for specialists per population will remain constant or even grow over time 7 . Others have argued that more appropriate use of the skills and expertise of specialists would bring supply and demand into balance within the constraints of future workforce supply 8 , 9 . For example , some large integrated health systems use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve comparable outcomes 10 " 12 . <p> While consensus on the role of primary care clinicians in specialty referrals has been established , similar consensus on the normative role of specialists has not been achieved 4 . For example , primary care clinicians initiate referrals and coordinate specialty care when diagnostic uncertainty arises or treatment becomes complex 13 , 14 . Responsibilities for primary care clinicians in this role include ensuring that the health needs of patients are met , services are integrated across providers and over time , and patients are linked with relevant community resources 15 " 17 . The benefits of these primary care tasks have been established empirically 13 , 18 . <p> Empirical research on the role of specialists in the referral process is less well defined and mainly involves comparisons of primary care vis-+ -vis specialist care without strong methodological rigor 19 . Overall , the literature suggests that care provided by specialists compared with that provided by generalists is more costly due to the addition of expensive tests and highly selective treatments 20 " 22 . In addition , care provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialist 's area of expertise but may be less evidence-based and associated with poorer outcomes outside their expertise . Several studies have examined care provided jointly by primary care clinicians and specialists for patients with chronic disease and have found that it is associated with better outcomes in comparison with either acting alone 23 " 26 . <p> With health care costs rising , efforts to control costs and improve the efficiency of the specialty referral process have gained renewed traction in current healthcare debates 27 " 29 . Measures of the specialty referral process are needed to inform the ongoing debate on the availability and appropriate role of specialists in the healthcare delivery system . To address this need , we sought to identify published measures that assess the performance of the specialty care process including the interface between primary care and specialty care . Such measures will be of interest to healthcare organizations to allow them to benchmark current practices , assist providers in meeting standards of care , and determine the most rational ways to organize the primary-specialty care interface . Such measures will also be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexities of the current referral process and to develop and test innovative improvements in specialty referrals . Therefore , the aims of the study were to 1 ) identify published measures of the specialty referral process through a systematic review of the literature , 2 ) categorize the measures according to a conceptual framework of the specialty referral process , and 3 ) assess the content validity of identified metrics , the conceptual framework developed , and the assignment of metrics to given domains of the framework among a group of specialty referral content experts . <h> Methods <h> Conceptual Framework <p> We developed a conceptual framework to guide the identification and categorization of measures of the specialty referral process ( Figure 1 ) . This framework was developed from a review of the literature on specialty referrals and conceptual frameworks and underwent several iterations based on suggestions from a panel of 10 content experts 4 , 30 " 32 . According to the framework , the specialty referral process represents a series of health-related events or stages ( i.e. domains ) to diagnose and/or manage a health condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek care for a health problem from a specialist ( Evaluation of Need for Specialty Care ) . Consultation regarding the referral decision may be made with a referral source such as a primary care clinician or emergency medicine clinician . Once a decision is made to seek a referral , the initiation of a referral involves the reason(s) for referral , urgency of referral , and selection of specific specialty ( Referral Initiation ) . In the next stage , a patient makes an appointment with a specialist ( Entry into Specialty Care ) , which can be delayed or hindered by a number of access-related barriers including geographic , organizational , and financial factors . Once a patient visit is completed , a specialist may direct a number of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures , consider duration of follow-up , and suggest additional referrals ( Clinical Tasks ) . The extent of the specialist involvement may be short-term and involve consultation for a diagnosis or specified procedure or may be long-term and involve co-managed care or transferred care ( Referral Type ) . Information regarding clinical tasks and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and care can be distributed between the specialist and the referring clinician ( Coordination ) . The clinical tasks involved in the referral process will consume an amount and monetary value of health services ( Resource Use ) and reflect a degree of quality consistent with best available evidence based on the patient 's and provider 's expectations of the referral ( Quality ) . The referral process from initiation to completion may impact on the patient 's health problem and his or her overall health and quality of life ( Outcomes ) . <p> Figure 1 <p> Specialty Referral Process . Referral process is a series of health-related events beginning when a patient has an assessment of need for specialty care , progresses to the decision to make a referral and enter into specialty care , and ends with the completion of referred care . The process encompasses communication and coordination between referring and consultant clinicians regarding tasks to be completed . The overall referral process results in a given resource utilization , quality , and outcomes for a patient . <h> Search Strategy <p> We conducted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that contain measures of the specialty referral process . We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE and HealthSTAR from January 1973 to June 2009 , to coincide with the emergence of managed care papers in the published literature to the present . We used a search strategy intended to be highly sensitive for identification of specialty referral articles from a previous study 4 : <p> The reference lists of all eligible papers were reviewed for additional eligible papers . In addition , published papers nominated by content experts were reviewed for eligibility . This research was granted an exemption from review by the Institutional Review Board at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia . <h> Eligibility Criteria <p> Studies were eligible if they were ( 1 ) published in peer-reviewed journals or government reports in 1973 or later , ( 2 ) performed in one of the member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries or Israel , ( 3 ) contained an operational measure(s) of the referral process with prior or current data supporting the measure 's validity ( content , concurrent , or construct ) or reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( 4 ) addressed referrals to a recognized medical specialty . Operational measures included instruments , questionnaires , and other tools that purport to measure a component of the specialty referral framework . Measures did not have to be specific to referrals but could report on the outcomes or quality of referrals . We accepted articles that demonstrated validity or reliability of the metric within the presentation of results of the paper ( e.g. , a metric that changes in hypothesized directions with outcome variables ) or made reference to a prior publication that reported on the measure 's validity or reliability . <p> A variety of exclusion criteria were employed to increase the specificity of article selection . First , we excluded studies that employed interventions which defined the duration and type of specialist involvement ; surveys in which general attitudes of the referral process were the focus ; and , studies of hypothetical referral scenarios , because we wanted to capture measures involved in actual referral behavior . Second , we excluded review papers , although we utilized these to identify papers containing referral metrics . Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the American Board of Medical Specialties ( e.g. physical therapists and dentists ) , since these may not involve clinician-to-clinician communication and coordination of referrals . We did capture referrals to psychologists , as they were often viewed along with psychiatrists as comprising mental health referrals in the literature . Fourth , we excluded referrals to hospital-based specialists including emergency departments , anesthesiologists , radiologists , and inpatient units of hospitals due to the urgent nature of many of these referrals . Fifth , we excluded curbside consultations , since data on these consultations are difficult to capture . <p> The title and abstract of all identified papers were reviewed for potential eligibility . The full-text of each potentially eligible paper was then reviewed for eligibility independently by three investigators ( JG , DH , CF ) , two of which were assigned to each paper . Differences between investigators were settled by consensus of all investigators as to whether the pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria were met . After a training period of approximately 50 papers , we had a final overall agreement rate of 87% with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eligible papers were abstracted using standardized abstraction forms that had been piloted prior to study initiation . Since papers may contain more than one relevant referral measure , we abstracted information on all metrics contained in each eligible paper that met eligibility criteria . We abstracted information on each metric 's definition as given in the published paper , its components and formula for calculation ( numerator , denominator ) , data type ( integer , ratio , proportion ) , data source ( administrative data , surveys , chart abstraction ) , validity measure , reliability measure , and use in the paper . We categorized each metric according to the Donabedian framework of structure , process , and outcome 33 . We also abstracted information from each paper on the specific specialty involved , the patient population ( children , adults ) , and disease state involved if any . Eligible metrics were then categorized into one or more domains and sub-domains of the conceptual framework of the specialty referral process ( Figure 1 ) . <p> To clarify measures and obtain missing information , we contacted corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were constructed , how they were validated , what their purpose was , and to obtain a copy of the instruments if available . Metrics were linked to all source studies , defined as the first published study containing an identified metric . Subsequent studies that contained a given metric were also linked to source studies . <h> Expert Panel <p> We identified a pool of content experts on specialty referrals through our literature search and by nomination of other experts . We selected a pool of 10 who agreed to assess the content validity of the metric set and the corresponding conceptual framework and to propose additional papers not previously identified in our literature search . The expert panel included health services researchers , clinical administrators , insurance executives , and practicing physicians from the U.S. and the U.K. Names of panel members can be found in the acknowledgement section . <h> Results <p> We identified 4,225 studies from our search of MEDLINE and HealthSTAR databases supplemented by additional papers from content experts and searches of the reference lists of eligible papers ( Figure 2 ) . After accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and government reports . Based on review of abstracts , we excluded 2,452 studies based on exclusion criteria and pulled the full text of 512 papers for a more comprehensive review . After reviewing the full-text of these potentially eligible papers , we excluded an additional 298 articles , which left 214 eligible papers containing 244 unique referral metrics ( Additional File 1 ) . We attempted to contact 126 corresponding authors , 24 of whom had no valid contact information . A majority of the remaining authors ( 90 of 102 , 88% ) responded to our inquiries and provided us with additional information or the full instruments if available . Based on this correspondence , we were able to obtain additional information for 129 metrics that was not readily apparent in the source studies ' methodologies . Of these , 79 metrics ( 61% ) were available in online resources , were provided by corresponding authors , or were embedded in the full text of papers . <p> Figure 2 <p> Flow chart of Literature Search . <p> A majority of the eligible metrics ( 57% ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 26% ) of the metrics were assessed exclusively in children and the remainder ( 17% ) were assessed in both child and adult populations . The majority of the measures ( 63% ) examined referrals to medical specialties , as opposed to surgical and mental health specialties . The most common individual subspecialty reported in the studies was mental health ( 42% ) , followed by otolaryngology ( 30% ) , dermatology ( 28% ) , neurology ( 23% ) , general surgery ( 23% ) , cardiovascular medicine ( 22% ) , and ophthalmology ( 21% ) or orthopedic surgery ( 21% ) . A number of measures ( 27% ) were evaluated in multiple subspecialties . <p> With consultation from the expert panel , measures were categorized into domains and sub-domains of the conceptual framework ( Table 1 ) . The majority of measures were from one of four domains : Referral Initiation ( 73 metrics , 30% ) , Entry into Specialty Care ( 53 metrics , 22% ) , Coordination ( 60 metrics , 26% ) , and Quality ( 57 metrics , 23% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for referral and selection of specialist ( 27 metrics ) and rates of referral ( 42 metrics ) . Entry into Specialty Care metrics were comprised of measures of accessibility ( 46 metrics ) with few assessing attendance at the specialist visit . Coordination metrics consisted of measures of communication of the reason and expectations for referral to the specialist ( 48 metrics ) , with few assessing integration of care with referring clinicians ( 17 metrics ) . Quality metrics were mainly comprised of timeliness of initial specialty visits ( 23 metrics ) and satisfaction ( 21 metrics ) . There were no identified quality measures assessing the safety or equity of referrals and few assessing the effectiveness , efficiency , or patient-centeredness of referrals . There were few measures that comprised Need for Specialty Care ( 14 metrics , 6% ) , Clinical Tasks ( 19 metrics , 8% ) , Referral Type ( 3 metrics ) , Resource Use ( 13 metrics , 5% ) , or Outcomes ( 9 metrics , 4% ) . <p> A majority of eligible metrics ( 60% ) assessed structural features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed processes ( 34% ) or outcomes ( 19% ) .

To improve the accuracy and precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for an individual metric , so a single operational measure may not be mutually exclusive to a particular type of data . Questionnaires included self-administered and staff-aided instruments completed by the patient , primary care physician , or specialist , and a majority of the measures ( 62% ) were derived from this source of information ( Table 2 ) . Approximately one fifth of the metrics ( 20% ) utilized administrative data , which included information readily available in health plans , public databases , scheduling and billing databases , and physician claims files . Roughly one third ( 31% ) of the measures were derived from chart reviews , which included referral letters , paper and electronic medical records , and referral logs maintained by office managers . Very few metrics ( 1% ) in this review did not report on data sources . <h> Discussion <p> In this review , we found that available measures were limited in assessing the process and outcomes of referrals . For example , we identified few measures that assess the adequacy and appropriateness of coordination of referrals , an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment of roles among primary care and specialty providers in coordinating care for patients . In addition , we identified few measures that assess the quality , resource consumption , and outcomes of referrals . Despite the availability of a number of validated measures designed to capture health services use or patient outcomes and well-being , few of these measures have been utilized in studies of specialty referrals 34 " 37 . Process measures help to tie structures to their intended outcomes . Clearly , measures that are intended to assess the process of referrals like care coordination and outcome measures are needed in order to better evaluate current referral quality . <p> The majority of measures we identified in this study require collection of new data through either questionnaires or chart reviews . Few ( 20% ) are designed to rely on existing administrative data . This presents challenges in the ability of metrics to be used to compare referral data across provider groups and health plans . However , with the national movement toward electronic health records ( EHR ) in the U.S. and elsewhere , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect referral data for cross-system comparisons . This will require consensus on the selection of key metrics among the many that are available . <p> This study has limitations that should be addressed . First , as with all systematic reviews , there exists the possibility of publication bias in which we missed important specialty care measures . We took a number of steps to limit this bias by utilizing a previously validated search strategy for identifying papers on specialty referrals , a thorough review of the reference lists of all eligible papers , and contact with experts in the field who could nominate additional papers to supplement our list . Second , our review identified a large pool of available validated measures without providing an endorsement for a core set of measures . Future study is needed to identify a subset of these measures that can be endorsed for more general use . <h> Conclusions <p> Operational measures of the specialty referral process are available in the published literature . A majority of identified metrics were studied among adult patients and evaluated the frequency and reason for referrals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , a majority of the measures focused on structural components of the referral process ; few measures assessed the process or outcomes of referrals . While measures in this review nearly universally included assessments of validity , few reported on reliability . Most measures relied on collection of new data rather than on existing administrative or claims data . <p> We believe that our study has important research implications . First , a set of referral measures such as those identified in this study can be utilized to assess the performance of the current referral system and to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of interventions to improve the quality and efficiency of specialty referrals . A toolkit is available on-line at LONG ... which lists searchable characteristics of these measures and provides their link to the conceptual framework . Identification and categorization of published measures of specialty care referral can be considered the first step toward assessment of the referral system . Consensus on a core set of measures derived from this study can then be developed to uniformly measure specialty referrals and benchmark referral practices . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers should target the development of new measures to fill these gaps and better assess the processes and outcomes of referrals . Third , the dynamics between primary and specialty clinicians are evolving as technological advancements become an important part of medical practices and electronic records , and electronic communication is changing the way information is managed and transferred . Finding ways to incorporate measures of specialty care and other aspects of health care delivery into electronic information systems can facilitate evaluation of current practices and contribute to the redesign of future specialty care referral processes . <h> Authors ' information <p> James P.

@@13586416 @2186416/ <h> Abstract <h> Background <p> The prevalence of multiple chronic diseases is increasing and is a common problem for primary health care providers . This study sought to determine the patient and health system burden of multiple chronic diseases among adults in Ontario , Canada , with a focus on the ambulatory health care system ( outpatient primary health care and specialist services ) . <h> Methods <p> This population-based study used linked health administrative data from Ontario , Canada . Individuals , aged 20years or older , who had a valid health card , were included . Validated case definitions were used to identify persons with at least one of the following nine chronic diseases : diabetes , congestive heart failure , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , hypertension , asthma , chronic obstructive lung disease , peripheral vascular disease and end stage renal failure . Prevalence estimates for chronic diseases were calculated for April 1 , 2009 . Ambulatory physician billing records for the two-year period , April 1 , 2008 to March 31 , 2010 , were used to identify the number of outpatient ambulatory care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ontarians had one chronic disease , 10.3% had two diseases , and 5.6% had three or more diseases . Annual mean primary health care use increased significantly with each additional chronic disease . Overall , there were twice as many patient visits to primary health care providers compared to specialists across all chronic disease counts . Among those with multiple diseases , primary health care visits increased with advancing age , while specialist care dropped off . While persons with three or more diseases accounted for a disproportionate share of primary health care visits , the largest number of visits were made by those with no or one chronic disease . <h> Conclusions <p> The burden of care for persons with multiple chronic diseases is considerable and falls largely on the primary health care provider . However persons with no or one chronic disease are responsible for the largest number of ambulatory health care visits overall . Continued investment in primary health care is needed both to care for those with multiple diseases and to prevent the accumulation of chronic diseases with aging . <h> Keywords <p> Multiple chronic diseasePrimary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as diabetes , heart disease and asthma , are the most prominent health care issues affecting Canadians 1 . There is growing recognition that chronic diseases do not occur in isolation , due , in large part , to shared risk factors and the accumulation of diseases with age 2 " 4 . In Canada , among people with chronic diseases , 49% of adults aged 65 " 79years and 59% of adults aged 80years and older report having at least two select diseases 4 . While patients with multiple diseases have their acute care needs met in the hospital , the majority of their long-term health care needs are managed by the primary health care providers 5 . Primary health care plays a central role in the treatment of chronic disease and also the prevention of disease and disease complications . Evidence indicates that timely and effective primary health care can improve health outcomes for persons with chronic diseases including fewer expensive hospitalizations and emergency department visits 6 , 7 . A better understanding of the impact of multiple chronic diseases on the primary health care system has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , 8 , 9 . <p> To date , research exploring the burden of disease on the primary health care system in Canada 3 " 5 has been largely based on data from population health surveys which are subject to recall bias and sampling errors and do not always distinguish between outpatient visits to primary health care and specialist physicians . The use of health administrative data allows for a unique view of actual patterns of health care use at a population level . Typically research with health administrative data categorizes people by level of overall disease morbidity and does not explore outcomes by disease count , in part because it can be a challenge to accurately ascertain diseases using administrative data . Starfield et al . used administrative data to explore outpatient health care utilization in the United States and found a striking increase in primary health care use among younger ( &lt;65years ) , but not older adults ( &gt;65years ) , with increasing levels of morbidity 10 . Broemeling et al . used administrative data to explore the health care utilization by persons in British Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of comorbid chronic diseases had more than three times the number of physician visits compared to the population average . <p> We sought to extend what is known about the burden of multiple chronic diseases by using highly validated disease ascertainment methods to determine the association of chronic disease count and patterns of ambulatory care use ( primary health care and specialist ) for the population of Ontario , Canada . <h> Methods <p> This study was conducted using population-based data from the province of Ontario , Canada with a current total population of more than 13 million people 12 . Data were obtained from the linkage of several administrative databases , including hospital discharge abstracts and physician claims for ambulatory visits ( i.e. outpatient data ) , housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) . The ICES databases are individually linked using an anonymous identification number in accordance with the provincial Personal Health Information Protection Act . <p> This study was approved by The Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board . <h> Population <p> We included all living adults , aged 20years or older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid Ontario health card on April 1 , 2009 . <p> To minimize inclusion of people who had potentially moved out of province , we excluded individuals who made no contact with the Ontario health care system within the five years prior to 2009 . This criterion was evaluated by applying the five-year date of last contact restriction to all Ontario respondents from three cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey ( conducted in 2001 , 2003 and 2005 ) . Of more than 150,000 respondents of the Canadian Community Health Survey , 99.8% of individuals who answered the survey had contact with the health care system within the five years prior to writing the survey . While this approach may exclude certain groups that have less contact with the health care system , such as younger , less sick adults , we feel that it ensures the most accurate estimate of the population residing in Ontario . <h> Chronic disease ascertainment <p> To identify persons in our population with a chronic disease we used pre-existing , validated health administrative data case definitions for the following nine chronic diseases : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke , hypertension , asthma , chronic obstructive lung disease , peripheral vascular disease and end stage renal failure . The specific details on the methods of disease ascertainment , including the technical case definitions used , are presented elsewhere 13 " 19 . Prevalence estimates for the number of chronic diseases were calculated for April 1 , 2009 . All adults in the Registered Persons Database who were eligible for provincial health insurance and had contact with the health care system in the preceding five years served as the denominator . <h> Health care utilization <p> We used provincial billing records to identify the number of outpatient health care visits made to primary care and specialist physicians within a two-year period ( April 1 , 2008 to March 31 , 2010 ) and presented results as an annual rate . Due to the high number of outpatient visits , the analysis was completed on a 25% random sample of the total study population . <h> Data analysis <p> We calculated chronic disease prevalence by disease count in the study population . To explore the health care burden on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care visits ( primary health care and specialist ) per person and stratified results by disease count . The total annual number of ambulatory health care visits for all persons in each disease count group was calculated to provide an estimate of the overall burden on the primary health care system . The impact of age on utilization was estimated by stratification of results across age categories . All analysis was done in SAS version 9.2 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . <h> Results <p> The prevalence of chronic diseases by disease count in Ontario on April 1 , 2009 is presented in Table1 . Just over 26% of Ontarians had one chronic disease , 10.3% had two diseases and 5.6% had three or more diseases . Table1 also presents the total number of primary health care visits to primary care physicians and specialists by disease count over the study period . There were twice as many primary health care visits , compared to specialist visits , across all disease counts . While persons with three or more diseases accounted for a disproportionate share of ambulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest absolute number of visits was made by those with no or one chronic disease ( Figure2 ) . <p> Table 1 <p> Prevalence of chronic disease by disease count ( April 1 , 2009 ) and number of ambulatory health care visits for Primary Care and Specialist physicians made between April 1 , 2008 and March 31 , 2010 ( N=28,450,000 ) <p> There is an increase in the mean number of health care visits to primary health care physicians with age , while health care visits to specialist physicians drop off at the highest age categories ( Figure3 ) . For example , young adults ( aged 20 " 44years ) with 6 or more diseases had 10 primary health care and 10 specialist visits per year , compared to those aged 85years and older with 6 or more diseases , who had 11 primary health care visits and only 4 specialist visits per year . <h> Discussion <p> The objective of this study was to describe the burden of multiple chronic diseases on the patient and the ambulatory health care system . Our results demonstrate three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the patient , as measured by mean number of ambulatory health care visits per year , was higher for those with multiple chronic diseases , the overall impact on the primary health care system was relatively small . Second , across all disease counts and ages there were many more visits to primary health care physicians compared to specialist physicians . This trend was evident even among the most elderly patients who , with age , had ever-increasing visits to primary health care physicians , while the number of visits to specialist physicians declined . Third , we found that , while the number of primary health care visits increased with age , the elderly with no diseases had many fewer visits per year , compared to younger adults with multiple chronic diseases . <p> Our findings confirm what other research has suggested about the high burden of chronic disease on the individual patient 3 , 4 , 11 . Recently , the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported results of a national survey that found more than twice the rate of reported visits to a family doctor among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only one chronic disease 3 . Using data from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey , those with multiple chronic diseases represented 12% of the population but they accounted for 24% of all primary health care visits and 25% of all specialist consultations 4 . In that study the mean annual number of consultations with a family doctor was 4.0 in general population , 3.1 for those with no diseases , 4.7 with 1 disease and 7.4 for those with three or more diseases ; estimates that are very close to our results . <p> Importantly , our study demonstrates that patients with multiple chronic diseases do not drive overall primary health care use in Ontario because prevalence of multiple chronic diseases in the population remains low . The majority of primary health care visits continue to be made by adults who have no or one disease . Future research could assess time trends to see if this pattern is changing , given the predicted rise in the prevalence of multiple chronic diseases with the aging population . <p> We acknowledge that a number of important chronic diseases were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . This may have resulted in an overestimation of the number of persons with no or one disease . Although the exclusion of these diseases may change prevalence estimates and the associated number of visits , we do not believe this has an impact on the patterns of health care utilization we found . If anything , our results are an underestimation of the overall burden of multiple chronic diseases on the primary health care system . Validation studies for the ascertainment methods for additional chronic diseases in the Ontario databases are an ongoing effort at ICES . <p> Canada has a strong primary health care system and primary health care providers act as gatekeepers to specialist services . Thus , it was not surprising to see that there were more primary health care visits in our study , particularly among the very elderly . The lower rate of specialist visits in the very elderly can be explained by factors such as fewer new disease diagnoses that require specialist consultation and primary care provider or patient preference for less intervention and testing . Our results are different from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for non-elderly patients ( &lt;65years ) with high levels of morbidity fell disproportionately on primary health care but this pattern did not hold for the elderly who had more specialist compared to primary health care visits 10 . This may , in part , be due to the broader age categories used in the American study but could also reflect a real difference in the use of specialist and primary health care services in these two countries . The appropriate number of visits to primary health care and specialist services is difficult to establish but this research points to the continued need for a robust primary health care workforce . <p> Recent attention has focused on determining the relative impact of age and chronic disease burden on health system utilization 3 . In their 2011 report , the Canadian Institute for Health Information used data from the Canadian Survey of Experiences With Primary Health Care to report on the impact of chronic diseases 3 . In that study , the total number of chronic diseases was more important than age in predicting the annual number of health care visits made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 to 74years , 75 to 84years , and 85years and older ) , those with three or more reported chronic diseases had nearly three times the total number of primary health care visits compared to seniors with no reported chronic diseases . We report on the impact of age and disease count by looking at annual mean number of primary health care visits and find that , at a patient level , primary health care visits increased with both the number of diseases and also with age . The relative importance of these two factors ( age and number of diseases ) should be explored in future studies using statistical modeling . <p> This study has limitations common to all research using administrative data . These databases were constructed to serve a billing role and , thus , while they are rich in information , they were not created for research or disease ascertainment . To limit errors in our disease estimates we have used highly validated definitions of chronic diseases , but we acknowledge the possibility of over and under-ascertainment of disease . Furthermore , we estimated primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visits and did not look at other health care services controlled by primary care , such as outpatient laboratory and diagnostic testing or number of prescriptions . Future research could explore these services to see if the patterns we identified hold . <h> Conclusion <p> Primary health care plays a strong and vital role in managing chronic diseases . Results from this study show that the burden of care for persons in Ontario with chronic diseases , particularly the elderly , falls on the primary health care system . We found that , while people with multiple chronic diseases have more annual visits to their primary health care physician , the overall health system impact of multiple chronic diseases is still relatively small compared to the health care use of those with no or one chronic disease . These data support the continued investment in primary health care and the need for a strong focus on disease prevention to avoid the accumulation of chronic diseases . <h> Authors ' information <p> EM is a new investigator at the C.T .

Today , it constitutes 18 percent of GDP , up from 14 percent in 2000 and 5 percent in 1960 , and we are well on our way to 21 percent by 2023 , based on current projections . This increased dedication of economic resources to the health sector , however , is not yielding commensurate value in terms of improving population health or patients experiences with care . <p> On average , the U.S. spends twice as much on health care per capita , and 50 percent more as a share of GDP , as other industrialized nations do . And yet we fail to reap the benefits of longer lives , lower infant mortality , universal access , and quality of care realized by many other high-income countries . There is broad evidence , as well , that much of that excess spending is wasteful . Stabilizing health spending and targeting it in ways that ensure access to care and improve health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed economic and social investmentsboth public and privateas well as higher wages for workers . <p> In this report , The Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance Health System endorses the goal of holding future growth in total health spending to a rate no greater than that of long-term growth in GDP , while simultaneously moving toward a high performance health care system . This is an ambitious goal , to be sure , particularly given our aging population and the commitment to access for all . But with such a high proportion of our economic resources already devoted to health care , and with abundant evidence that we can do better , such a target should be achievable . It is also a key to enabling broader economic growth and a more affordable health care system for businesses , families , and federal , state , and local governments . <p> The policies described below should produce substantial reductions in health spending . But if spending growth targets are not met , further action should be taken to address areas in which spending growth is excessive . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly on both geographic areas and types of services that are found to be drivers of excessive spending and spending growth . The establishment of targets , then , can serve both as a metric to guide policy development and as an incentive for all involved parties to act to make them effective . <p> To show how future health spending growth could be held to a national target and stabilized while moving toward a high performance health care system , this report lays out a synergistic strategy relying on three broad thrusts : <p> Policies to expand options and encourage high-value choices by consumers armed with better information about the quality and cost of care . <p> Systemwide action to improve how health care markets function , including reducing administrative costs and setting national and regional targets for spending growth . <p> The set of policies the Commission has identified in these three areas would interact with each other in mutually supportive ways to address market forces that contribute to high and rising costs but are failing to produce value . By applying these policies collectivelywith the public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from their synergy . Analysis of specific policies consistent with these approaches indicates that they could slow growth in national spending by a cumulative $2 trillion through 2023 . Achieving these potential savings depends on starting now and acting together . <h> Strategic Approach <p> This report translates these three broad thrusts into 10 policies to illustrate our comprehensive approach to stabilizing spending growth . The policies reinforce each other to address concerns about both public and private health care costs while also improving health outcomes and patients care experiences . <p> Revise Medicare physician fees and methods of updating payment so that we pay for value . Replace Medicares current system for determining physician fees ( and the resulting reductions called for under current law ) by holding fees constant at their current level , while adjusting relative payment rates for services that meet specified criteria as " overpriced . " Provide increases in future payments only for providers that participate in payment and delivery system innovations that are accountable for the populations they serve . Institute competitive bidding for medical commodities such as drugs , equipment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams for high-cost , complex patients . Promote patient-centeredness and better outcomes by changing payment for primary care to reward care management , coordination , and a team-based , systemic approach to treating patients who are covered by Medicare , Medicaid , other public programs , and by private plans participating in the new health insurance exchanges . <p> Bundle hospital payments to focus on total costs and patient outcomes . Accelerate the implementation of provider reimbursement approaches in which a single payment is made for all services provided during an episode of care involving a hospital stay , including postacute services for specified procedures and conditions , for patients in Medicare , Medicaid , other public programs , and private plans participating in the new health insurance exchanges . <p> Adopt payment reforms across markets , with public and private payers working in concert . Align payment incentives across public and private payers to enable and support care systems that are more accountable for providing high-value care . Require private plans participating in health insurance exchanges to incorporate alternative payment approaches to support delivery system innovation , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundled payment for episodes involving hospital care , and shared savings or global payment arrangements with networks of providers . Encourage private insurance plans in each state to negotiate health care prices that are consistent with value and efficiencyand not just pass on higher prices to consumers . <p> Policies to Expand Options and Encourage High-Value Choices by Consumers : Create incentives for consumers to choose high-value care and high-performing care systems based on comparative information about quality and costs . <p> Offer Medicare beneficiaries a new " Medicare Essential " plan that provides more comprehensive benefits and better protection against catastrophic costs and includes provider and enrollee incentives to achieve better care , better health , and lower costs . Develop a value-based benefit design that encourages beneficiaries to obtain care from high-performing care systems . These incentives would be aligned with payment reforms that give providers incentives to develop and join innovative care systems that improve patient outcomes and care experiences . <p> Enhance information on clinical outcomes of care and patient experiences to inform treatment decisions and choices of providers and care systems . Accelerate the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare clinical outcomes over time from alternative treatment choices and , through use of patient registries , to enable post-marketing surveillance of safety and care outcomes . Provide consumers and clinicians with transparent information on costs and prices to further inform choices . <p> Simplify and unify administrative policies and procedures across public and private health plans to reduce provider and plan administrative costs and complexity . <p> Reform medical malpractice policy and link to payment in order to provide fair compensation for injury while promoting patient safety and adoption of best practices . <p> Establish spending targets . Target total combined public and private spending to grow at a rate no greater than economic growth per capita . Set targets for the nation ( long-term GDP growth per capita ) , as well as for states , regions , or localities , and adjust policies as appropriate based on progress in meeting targets . Collect data to inform and enable state and local action to develop focused policies if growth exceeds targets . <p> Setting a target for overall spending growthacross all payers , public and private , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth per capita would provide guidance for these policies and any further policy action that is needed . Collecting data on total spending and sources of spending growth at the national , state , and local levels would enable state and local governments to set their own targets and develop focused policies to meet them . <p> More consistent payment approaches across payers also could help counteract the concentration of market power among providers . Allowing multiple payers to negotiate jointly to employ similar payment methods and more consistent pricing under state or federal government auspices and aligning payment with efficient care and value , rather than simply passing on higher prices in consolidated markets , could lower private insurance premium costs for businesses and families . Joint negotiations among health care purchasers would need to take place under public auspices to ensure accountability . <p> Over time , the policies described in this report should generate evolutionary forces that lead to the formation of health care delivery organizations that are held accountable for the costs of care as well as health outcomes and care experiences . By assessing system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be calibrated to address areas in which there is excessive cost growth . <h> Synergistic Policies <p> Our synergistic approach is intended to build on the substantial movement already afoot to improve health system performance . The policies would interact to accelerate and focus that momentum to achieve the goals of better health , better health care experiences , and lower costs.1 <p> The need for action applies not only to the federal government , but also to state and local governments , businesses , and householdsall of which are under increasing financial pressure from rapid health spending growth . The overarching goal should be moving the U.S. health system toward a higher level of performance , one marked by access to affordable care for all , improved quality and patient-centeredness , greater accountability for both health outcomes and treatment costs , and enhanced population health . A high performance health system is not only consistent with stability in health care spending , it is essential for it . <p> To examine the potential of our proposed synergistic policies , The Commonwealth Fund contracted with Actuarial Research Corporation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending by 2023 if an illustrative set of policies were to take effect in 2014 , assuming the policies are enacted in 2013 . The analysis examined the net impact on spending by the federal government , state and local governments , private employers , and households as well as total health spending.2 <p> The estimates suggest the policies consistent with the strategic approach could reduce projected health spending by a cumulative $2.004 trillion over the first 10 years ( 20142023 ) . The savings would accrue to the federal government ( $1.036 trillion ) , state and local governments ( $242 billion ) , employers ( $189 billion ) , and households ( $537 billion ) . <p> For the federal government , the analysis indicates net savings well beyond the level necessary to offset the 10-year costs of replacing current Medicare policies that call for steep cuts in payments to physicians under the sustainable growth rate ( SGR ) formula . By instituting broader Medicare payment reforms and ensuring these spread to Medicaid as well , the pace of delivery system reform would be accelerated without resorting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings for federal programs . Targeted policies to lower administrative costs for providers could furthermore support growth in clinician incomes . <p> U.S. households would be the major winners over time from the strategic approach we describe here , with the potential for better care and health outcomes as well as an estimated $537 billion in direct savings over 10 years . These savings result from lower future insurance premium and out-of-pocket costs resulting from more efficient insurance markets serving Medicare beneficiaries , and from slower growth in the underlying costs of care as the delivery system responds to new incentives for enhanced , high-value care and care systems . In the end , reduced health spending by federal , state , and local governments and private employers also would accrue to households , which ultimately bear the burden of health spending through higher taxes , reduced wages , and direct out-of-pocket costs . <p> It is important to note that , even with these savings , the health sector would continue to grow . This growth would provide resources to innovate and develop new medical breakthroughs , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . <p> Notably , the bulk of the estimated $2 trillion in savings comes from pay-for-value reforms that accelerate delivery system innovation and from lowering insurance-related administrative costs by simplifying and standardizing reporting and other policies . Administrative simplification savings would largely accrue to providers , freeing up physicians and their staff to spend more time on patient care . <p> The analysis indicates that such a comprehensive and synergistic approach , with all payers pulling together in the same direction , would stabilize health care spending and bring it more in line with growth of the economy . The percentage of GDP spent on health care by 2023 would be an estimated 19 percentsimilar to the 18 percent projected in 2013 ( before the policies begin to take effect ) and considerably lower than the 21 percent projected under current law . <p> The growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary would be below GDP growth for most of the decade , with substantial net savings compared with current projections . In contrast with Medicare , however , although private spending per enrollee would slow , it would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If focused policies at the local , state , regional , or national level slowed private per-person spending growth to bring it more in line with economic growth , the estimates indicate that national health expenditures ( NHE ) as a share of GDP by 2023 would be near the 2013 level . <p> Spending growth targets and data for assessing change will be instrumental to inform future action . At the state or local market level , it will be particularly important to have reliable information on baseline total spending and trends so that policies can be developed as needed , since patterns would likely vary in different parts of the country . Policies could be adjusted over time to achieve targets by the end of the decade . <p> To get these results , it will be necessary to act quickly and for major payers to pull together with a sense of urgency . The net impact of these policies accelerates over time as the health care delivery system and markets respond to new incentives and as the policies spread across the public and private sectors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System offers this synergistic set of policies as a way forward for federal and state policymakers and private-sector health care leaders confronting escalating health care costs . We also offer criteria to guide national discussions related to the federal deficit and federal health programs . Building on the three pillars of payment reform , high-value choices , and other market reforms , the United States has the potential to accelerate health care innovation while ensuring access for all . <h> Mission <p> The mission of The Commonwealth Fund is to promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access , improved quality , and greater efficiency , particularly for society 's most vulnerable , including low-income people , the uninsured , minority Americans , young children , and elderly adults .

There is no unique methodological approach for the economic evaluation of such research . In our systematic search we found no research that had evaluated the economic return of research in low and middle income countries . We therefore recommend a consensus on practical guidelines at international level on the basis of more comprehensive methodologies ( such as Canadian Academic of Health Science and payback frameworks ) in order to build capacity , arrange for necessary informative infrastructures and promote necessary skills for economic evaluation studies . <h> Background <p> Healthcare research can expand the frontiers of science , save human lives , and improve quality-of-life . One of the most fundamental challenges is the appropriate allocation of public and private funds to this research sector . The 2008 ' Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health ' in Mali hosted ministers and representative councils from 59 countries . This forum concluded that each country should allocate 2% of Health Ministry funds to healthcare research 1 . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare research , it remains difficult to convince governments and the private sector to invest in such research , especially in developing countries , which have limited financial resources . In recent years , investors and researchers have focused on the presumed benefits of healthcare research projects , so it is now necessary for health research systems to consider costs and benefits . <p> A reduction in healthcare research funding is likely given the current economic crisis , particularly in countries that have previously been unable to allocate sufficient funds for this purpose . In fact , before many countries can attain suitable public health standards , they will be faced with reductions in research funds , making it even more difficult to attain the required standards . The WHO ' Financial Crisis and Global Health ' report emphasizes that healthcare research is not a luxury , but is rather vital for meeting the needs of the healthcare sector in times of economic crisis 2 . Therefore , we suggest that every country should evaluate the economic benefits of healthcare research to secure sufficient funds for this endeavor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic impact of healthcare research . <h> Methods <p> An electronic search of English-language articles was conducted in numerous bibliographic databases in March of 2009 using a combination of keywords : health research , health system research , medical research , payback , impact , assessment , evaluation , research utilization , rate of return , internal rate of return and net present value . The databases searched were PubMed , CINAHL , Dissertation and Thesis , Urban History , Leicester , Australian Digital Thesis Program , DART-Europe E-theses Portal , and the University of Michigan 's OAlster service . <p> An electronic search was also performed to locate 21 relevant websites ( Table 1 ) . Reports that were relevant to our study were chosen from these websites . The entire article-screening procedure was conducted independently by two individuals .

A review of included studies indicated that evaluations of the economic impact of healthcare research were performed ( a ) to estimate the economic benefits of projects as a criterion for prioritizing research 3 " 8 , and , ( b ) to determine the investment returns of projects ( Table 2 ) .

Macroeconomic studies examine the relationship between the costs of conducting research and benefits gained at macro level and calculate the overall return but do not specify the process ( in epidemiological studies ; an ' ecologic study ' is identical to a ' macroeconomic study ' ) . Examples of such studies are the exceptional return reports prepared in America in 2000 9 , similar studies in Australia in 2003 and 2005 10 , 11 and the study of " Medical Research : What 's it worth ? Estimating the economic benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The American report considered mortality and increased life expectancy as outcomes of research 9 . The Australian studies reviewed nationwide mortality and morbidity and the association between research investment and economic benefits . The main limitation of such studies is the presence of multiple confounding factors and the attribution problem . <p> In addition to showing the overall return rate , the UK study ' Medical Research - What 's it worth ? is an example of a study that calculates factors such as lag time , and which estimates the economic returns of individual treatments 12 . <p> Case studies examine the impact of specific healthcare research , investigate the details of return and propose ideas for increasing it . To evaluate healthcare research in case studies , researchers have defined frameworks that classify the impact of healthcare research in various dimensions , one of which is economic impact . The frameworks identified in this study and the economic outcomes proposed are as follows : <h> The Payback framework <p> This framework was introduced by the " Health Economics Research Group " ( HERG ) of Brunel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over several years 13 " 16 . One aspect of the framework was ' Broader economic benefits ' . In this area , the authors defined broader economic benefits as " benefits resulting from commercial utilization of research innovations " , and " benefits resulting from healthy workforce and reduction of days off work " . This framework was examined in seven studies performed in the United Kingdom , Ireland , The Netherlands , and Hong Kong that were slightly modified according to local conditions and requirements 17 " 20 . Some studies considered ' worker stress reduction ' , ' public health promotion ' , ' mental health promotion ' , ' reduction of the unemployed ' , ' higher productions ' , and ' increasing equity ' as economic benefits . Another study considered the following aspects as economic benefits : recruiting and keeping high-quality researchers , establishing or re-activating new companies , employing people in laboratories , increasing international funds , attracting external investment , continuing to invest in foreign companies , attracting funds for future research , introducing the country as a center-of-excellence , international recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification of groups at risk for intervention , and research advancements in healthcare delivery systems and planning . <p> Interestingly , some of these factors carry meaningful economic benefits only at national level , and can not be considered of significance on an international scale . All cited studies indicated the appropriateness and practicality of using the payback framework . <p> This approach has also been used in the design of the ' Canadian Institutes of Health Research ' 21 and the ' Canadian Academy of Health Science ' frameworks 22 . This illustrates that the payback framework can cover all aspects of healthcare research . <p> This version of the payback framework was introduced by the ' Canadian Institutes of Health Research ' in 2005 . Here , the economic impacts of healthcare research are classified into four domains : commercial benefits , direct cost-savings , human capital , and the value of life and health . <p> The framework also describes how these domains are measured . In the commercial benefits domain , the major indicators are number and types of patents , spin-off companies and licenses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the direct cost-savings domain , Estimating the economic value of innovations created by health research , and ( in the human capital domain ) , calculation of the reduction in production losses resulting from illness and/or injury , are the major indicators . In the value of life and health domain , the main indicator is the economic value of the extra years of life gained through novel treatments . <p> This framework was introduced in 2006 . Here , also , multiple dimensions have been described for assessing the impact of research , two of which account for economic benefits . These are ' service impact ' and ' societal impact ' . ' Service impact ' refers to cost savings in healthcare delivery systems ( ' limitation and effectiveness of costs ' ) . The ' societal impact ' refers to economic benefits at the macro level , such as the commercial benefits of producing and selling products , selling more effective procedures to industry , transfer of healthcare programs to the private sector , and the benefits of healthy workplaces and healthy lifestyles ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2009 , and has five domains that describe the impact of healthcare research . One advantage of this framework is that in addition to describing the indicators , applications are also proposed . The economic and social impacts of this framework include the following indicators : <p> 1 . <p> Activity impact indicators : <p> Labor rent or economic rent : economic impacts ( with monetary criteria ) that result from employment in healthcare research rather than other sectors . <p> G Valuation of spin-out companies : portfolio values of spin-out companies and sales of such companies . <p> G Economic rent ( producer rent and spillover effects ) : ' Producer rent ' is the economic benefit to a company when expected revenues are exceeded . The ' spillover effect ' is the impact of investment in research and development on groups that did not receive direct funding . <p> 3 . <p> Health benefit indicators : the value of results in terms of healthcare benefits , as measured by the Quality Adjusted Life Years ( QALYs ) scale . <p> 4 . <p> Well-being indicators : levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other indicators . <p> 5 . <p> Social benefit indicators : extent of changes in socio-economic because of healthcare research . <p> Table 3 presents a summary of the economic indicators defined in the various frameworks . <p> Table 3 <p> Indicators defined for measuring economic benefits of health research in available frameworks <h> What economic outcomes are attributable to research ? <p> Healthcare research can benefit both human health and the economy , and the improvement in human health can be described by economic indicators . Multiple definitions and classifications have been proposed to explain the direct economic benefits of healthcare research , such as direct cost-savings resulting from research-driven innovation , cost-savings in service delivery systems , and benefits from commercial development of products and technologies 10 , 17 , 24 . Criteria such as death reduction , increase in lifespan , reduction of diseases , and increase in quality-of-life and life expectancy are used to assess health status . In the UK study ' Medical Research - What 's it worth ? ' the QALYs gained and impact on the GDP of the UK ( the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health research were considered as outcomes in study of the economic impact of medical research 12 . <p> Different methods have been proposed to identify the impact of healthcare research on human health for the purpose of differentiating it from other factors . One proposal is the study of short-term effects of specific efforts , such as cardiovascular research . Such research can include diagnostic and therapeutic studies on targeted patient populations , or preventative research on nutrition and lifestyle in apparently healthy targeted populations . The time horizon and target population should be considered in addressing the attribution problem . Thus , ' reduced mortality after myocardial infarction ' may be used as an outcome of diagnostic and therapeutic research , and ' overall reduction of cardiovascular disease mortality ' over an extended period of time may be used in preventative studies . The latter criterion may be influenced by behavioral changes and improved lifestyle , which lead to disease reduction , but not necessarily to reduced mortality 25 . <p> An attribution of 50% is considered acceptable in some studies , and a sensitivity analysis of 30-70% has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , one study showed that , with cardiovascular disease , one-third of the reduced mortality was attributable to aggressive treatments , one-third to pharmacologic developments , and one-third to behavioral changes 26 . Thus , when measuring the return of pharmacologic research on cardiovascular disease , it could be considered that only one-third of mortality and morbidity reduction may be attributed to pharmacologic developments . <h> How can healthcare status be described by financial indicators ? <p> Once the health status outcome is determined , it is necessary to describe this by use of financial indicators . Methods such as ' individual willingness-to-pay ' , a ' productivity approach ' ( e.g. additional earnings of cancer survivors 11 , 27 , and ' maximum funds provided by the health delivery system to obtain one health unit ' 17 have been used . <h> When should we evaluate the economic benefits of research ? <p> There is no general consensus on the timeframe needed to assess the economic benefits of healthcare research , but some researchers have proposed 3-5 years as appropriate 21 . After examining various studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' study in 2008 suggested 10-25 years ( average : 17 years ) for cardiovascular research and 9-14 years ( average : 12 years ) for mental health research as the average time from research to health impact 12 . However , the duration will depend on the type of study , the expected impact and the particular circumstances of each individual country . <h> Discussion <p> Various methods and approaches are used for the economic assessment of healthcare research . There are two basic methods for studying such benefits : macroeconomic evaluation of the relationship between funds spent on research and economic benefits , and case studies which examine a single research or program . <p> It is often difficult to attribute an observed change in public health as causally related to funding for healthcare research , especially in macroeconomic studies . This is one of the rationales for case studies and for employing specific frameworks that facilitate the evaluation process . Among the available frameworks , the payback framework 13 has been used as a basis for all other frameworks , and has been employed more than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAHS ) framework 22 is one novel proposed approach , the suitability and practicality of which have not yet been examined , although it does provide a more complete and comprehensive overview of the economic impact of healthcare research . It must be kept in mind that each of the available frameworks was designed for specific reasons . <p> A review of all relevant studies indicates that attribution of economic benefits to healthcare research requires that the impacts of interventions are measured . In fact , in such studies , research results should be attributed to a decision or change in behavior of a target group , and , next , the impact of the decision or behavioral change should be measured . Therefore , consideration of the implementation of results is very important in assessing the benefits of healthcare research 28 . <p> Another important consideration is the cost of implementing interventions . For evaluation of the economic impact of healthcare research , two types of costs must be considered : the cost of conducting research , and the cost of implementing research results . Regarding the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benefit . Thus , combined indicators such as ' net present value ' , ' return on investment ' , and ' benefit-cost ratio ' can be used 11 . For healthcare research to provide economic benefits , results must be implemented , but it is unclear whether the costs of implementing such results should be considered in evaluating the final economic benefits . Some researchers believe that the expense of implementing research results should be considered in evaluation of the economic benefits of such research because high expense is of little benefit for patients who are near death ; research on novel care techniques has fewer benefits than research on preventative methods ; and theoretical estimates have shown that , for specific gender and age groups , the benefits of prolonging life are less than curative expenditures 25 . The authors believe that it is only logical and necessary to take into account the cost of implementation of research in valuing healthcare research whose ultimate goal is to improve community 's health . <p> In the studied reports , the sections on evaluation of the economic impacts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of appropriate data . In fact , in most studies the researchers simply forecast economic impact , and do not actually measure outcomes . In some cases , data from other related or unrelated healthcare sectors can be used , but this information is not always available or complete . Thus , separate studies are needed to evaluate the economic benefits of healthcare research . Also , to facilitate the evaluation of the economic impacts of such research , the criteria used to define benefits and the sources of necessary information should be clearly identified from the beginning . <p> The indicators used to assess the economic impacts of healthcare research depend on the type of study . Thus , research projects can be classified as etiologic , interventional , policy analysis , health service , theoretical , methodological or healthcare system studies 29 . Based on the type of study , the expected economic impact , the time required to assess the impact , and comprehensive and practical indicators , should be clearly defined and specified . To facilitate economic evaluation , we suggest that researchers add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are explicitly stated . <p> Another important issue is consideration of the benefits from domestic and foreign investment in healthcare research . Some interventions , technologies , and drugs used in a country actually result from research conducted in other countries , so not all economic benefits can be classified as domestic . The ' Medical Research - What 's it worth ? ' study has used citations to relevant clinical guidelines to calculate the attribution of developments made in cardiovascular and mental health research in the UK to medical research worldwide 12 . The potential benefits of local investment in the research results of other countries should not be overlooked . Studies conducted to implement the research results from overseas ( effectiveness studies ) , or investment in developing a drug that is produced in another country , can both be considered as investment in local research ( the ' spillover effect ' ) . <p> Care must be taken in interpreting economic evaluation studies on health research . Be it positive or negative , these results may be the effect of various methodology flaws that over-represent or under-represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into account while interpreting their results . The economic benefits of healthcare research may be assessed incorrectly in the following cases : absence of valid , reliable and operational indicators for measuring economic benefits ; use of incorrect and incomplete data . Even if it is proven that the investment return is low or negligible , it is still necessary to assess economic benefits , because this can indicate a waste of resources and the weaknesses should be identified using the assessment results and consequently be corrected . <h> Conclusions <p> Healthcare research strategies have undergone significant changes over the past 20 years . Previously , ' capacity building ' was a significant focus , and this led to healthcare research methodology workshops , especially in the 1980s . Next , identification of the ' 10/90 gap ' ( 10% of worldwide expenditure on healthcare research is devoted to problems that primarily affect the poorest 90% of the population ) led to re-prioritization of research focus30 . Since then , the gap between research and the effects on human health have been identified , and knowledge translation was considered one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as emphasized in the Bamako Forum of 2008 31 . Now that the world has entered an economic crisis , we suggest that it is important that the economic outcomes of research should play a pivotal role in healthcare research . <p> We found no reports on the research payback of low and middle income countries who have less financial resources ( and allocate a smaller share of their GDP to health and its relevant researches ) in our systematic review . This may partly be due to publication bias , but lack of the necessary infrastructure and skills for performing research payback studies in such countries is no doubt another reason . We suggest that international organizations , such as the World Health Organization and ' The Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research ' or other global initiatives seek to propagate , facilitate , and compare healthcare research economic evaluation throughout the world . Frameworks that have introduced more appropriate components ( such as CAHS and payback frameworks ) can be considered as the basis in this respect , and practical guidelines for capacity building and arranging necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these countries . <p> This movement should be launched with the aim of ' compiling a standard methodology on the basis of objectives , information , and available facilities in developed and developing countries ' , ' preparation and dissemination of tools required for measuring economic outcomes of health research ' , and ' specification of the expected economic outcomes ' . This will help us to achieve the goals agreed upon at the Bamako Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health in 2008 . <h> Author 's information <h> Declarations <h> Acknowledgements <p> This project was conducted with the financial support of Tehran University of Medical Sciences ' Vice Chancellor for Research through contract no. 132/8680 .
