Recently , AliExpress.com have spent a lot of resources into combatting this , so dropshipping suppliers who scam are now quite rare . Although the platform is taking care of fraudulent- dropshipping suppliers itself , we still suggest that you perform- a background check on your drop shipping suppliers , so that you can guarantee your customers will receive good service and enjoy product satisfaction . Weve put this article together to show you how to find dropshippers on AliExpress , and show you the types of dropshipping suppliers you should avoid . <h> Do n't Always Go For the Lowest Price <p> Typically , the price of a product on AliExpress.com is comparative with the products- quality . Do n't get overly excited when you find the same product at a fraction of the price . Fortunately , there are a lot of AliExpress suppliers offering similar products . However , remember to compare the prices which different dropshipping suppliers have set . If a number of sellers have similar prices for- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , this often means the quality is lower , especially if the price is cheaper . Another key point is to look at the AliExpress suppliers reviews to determine if there has been any impact on quality . <p> Although a lower price does not necessarily mean that the dropshipping suppliers products are of a lower quality and vice versa , we highly recommend that you avoid the following situation : <p> Remember that drop shipping suppliers on AliExpress.com have very tight margins and understand them well , which- is why a higher price normally means a better quality product . <p> Two of the most important factors while evaluating AliExpress dropshipping suppliers are their Feedback Score and Positive Feedback Rate . The Feedback Score indicates the seller 's sales volume , while the Positive Feedback Rate represents the feedback rate which the dropshipping supplier has received . When you 're choosing AliExpress dropshipping suppliers you should always aim for 95% and higher positive feedback rate and at least a 2,000 feedback score . <p> How To Select Dropshipping Suppliers on AliExpress <p> When you 're running your ecommerce business you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take note that this does n't automatically mean that dropshipping suppliers with a lower- feedback score- ca n't be trusted , but its a good general measure to go by . <p> Next , you should consider individual product feedback and the order count . It 's much safer to buy a product that has been ordered a few thousand times with a 90% positive feedback score , than a product that has only been sold twice but has a 100% positive feedback score . Look for any unhappy customers . Usually , the unhappy customers help identify possible products defects and issues . <p> However , if a certain- product does n't  yet have any feedback , look up the other products- that the dropshipping supplier carries and check the feedback . If you notice that the other products which the drop shipping supplier is selling have good feedback then you 're good to go , it not then you may want to stay away from that supplier . <h> Be Careful With Dropshipping Suppliers Selling Brand Products <p> When figuring out how to find dropshippers on AliExpress , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing their own branded products and not knockoffs . Genuine designer products are rarely found on AliExpress.com its always best to avoid popular brand name products in your store , as they 're likely fake . If you find that a drop shipping supplier which you 're sourcing products from is selling counterfeit goods then you should avoid using them and report that seller to AliExpress . <h> Pay Attention to the Responsiveness of Drop Shipping Suppliers <p> Let 's say you have an emergency situation a customer files a dispute on your PayPal account and insists on a reshipment . You want drop shipping suppliers to respond to you immediately , do n't you ? Notably , the responsiveness of your drop shipping suppliers helps you answer the question : how to find dropshippers on AliExpress . When you 're searching for dropshipping suppliers on AliExpress you 'll need to take into account their responsiveness as well as the products which they 're selling . <p> In order to protect yourself against such situations , always check the responsiveness of AliExpress suppliers before importing any of their products to your ecommerce store .

Note how long it takes for your seller to reply and how they handle the situation. - A great dropshipping supplier will respond to you quickly , be understanding of your problem , and act fast to rectify it . Thankfully , you 'll be able to find lots of great dropshipping suppliers on AliExpress . <h> How to Find Dropshippers on AliExpress by Ordering Samples <p> When the primary due diligence of the drop shipping supplier is over and you 've imported their products to your store you should place a couple of test orders to determine their quality . If your funds allow it , we suggest that you order 3 " 5 samples from different sellers . When determining how to find dropshippers on AliExpress , figuring out which product samples have the highest qualities will be helpful for finding the best dropshipping suppliers . However , you likely wo n't be able to order samples of all the products which you 're planning to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store as possible to see how long the delivery actually takes , the quality of the product , and the packaging which they use for shipping . <p> While it makes perfect sense to order samples before selling them in your store , it may also be useful to wait until you have already imported their products . If you 've researched the dropshipping supplier carefully before you decided to import any of their products into your store , your first sale could be the final step for validating them as a supplier for your ecommerce business . There are plenty of drop shipping suppliers on AliExpress which you can test products from , so do n't  be discouraged if your first drop shipping supplier does n't  work out perfectly . <h> General Safety Tips " Buyers ' Safety Programme <p> AliExpress.com guarantees a full refund if a customer does n't receive the order and a partial refund if the item which you receive is not as described .

From this page you can formally discuss possible solutions with the dropshipping supplier . If you 're not satisfied with the seller 's suggestions , you can escalate the dispute to AliExpress.com . They will then mediate between both you and the seller to resolve the issue . <p> HI Tomas , Thanks for a very useful informative post . All i want to know about dropshiping is its cycle . Is it oberlo who buys the product and send it to the customer(end-user) or the direct vendor does it . How about the taxing ie. customs taxes , suppose we say iam in india and i wanted to sell kids cloths to my own locality . Can i use oberlo for dropshipping how long will it take for the package to reach the customer . <p> If you were to dropship to the US , the delivery usually takes around 15 days ( using ePacket ) / to India it would probably take around 30 days . There are usually no taxes/customs for small quantity and low value products . <p> I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my store named https : //www.felcyfashions.com now iam seeing the amount in USD and when i change the settings in shopify it is not calculating the current amount rather it is showing the exact figure with the RS symbol in front . How to overcome it . <p> Hello Tomas Slimas thanks for your very useful post i have a question to ask . i am from india and i want to sale products in USA and Australia so how can i do and also is there any shiping cost aliexpress will charge from me Thanks <p> hi and thanks in advance for very informative website and articles ! I am interested in starting dropshipping business and selling to us and european markets , but i live in greece and we have very strict tax laws in effect at the moment so my question is this : will i be able to obtain an invoice from aliexpress suppliers to give to my accountant ? <p> I cant guarantee that . You could message your supplier and ask him/her if he could provide you with the invoices in advance . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accounting would be much easier when you do n't  import products to your country . <p> Kostas Stathis <p> Hi again and thnx for your prompt answer ! I really do n't  care to sell to greek market but only to usa and european market , so i was just wondering as my accountant asks , how will cost of goods sold be accounted for if you are not able to get an invoice from supplier so u can in return send a receipt to your own customer I would really like to get some feedback on how you get around this matter either from you or any other dropshipersi would really like to get into this but i do n't  see it possible , if you are not able to get invoice from suppliers , how do you account for items and cost of goods sold ? <p> Kostas Stathis <p> It would be great if aliexpress had an automatic invoice sent to the dropshipper much like fiverr does <p> Vanessa <p> When Aliexpress ships the item to your customer , wont the customer see the Chinese labeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing the item is coming from China ? <p> You could ask what other dropshippers are doing on our forum http : //ask.oberlo.com/ . I was getting invoices directly from our supplier via email ( back when I was dropshipping ) , but others might have other methods ( like printscreening order receipts on AliExpress ) . <p> Kostas Stathis <p> Thnx again for your replys , i will go the forum and check it out <p> Chris Busbridge <p> Yes , but you can arrange with Oberlo ( or with seller ) to provide either plain packing or your own custom packing from your store <p> Boss Lady and Company <p> Hello , Can Oberlo work with different sites like Alibaba , if so , how do I use it ? <p> Is it worth asking the supplier for a sample ? sorry if you have been asked this before . <p> Justin <p> Shipping : I 'm feeling quite lost . I have some questions : when importing a products must i choose a shipping country ? How can i know where a product will go ? I 've imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Can i add one or should i leave it blank ? <p> Price varients : is there any guide on entering pricae varients ? <p> Products photos : Do photos go with a product when you select a push to store ? If not how can i get them ? <p> Refunds : is it very complicted to refund a customer ? <p> How do i get paid and where : Am i right a customer orders a products and pays me ? Do i then pay the supplier ? Is the money put in and taken out of the same place eg Paypal ? ? Do i need a paypal account and a credit card on the paypal account ? <p> Hi Gerald , sorry for being late with the answer . Its worth it , but its definitely not a must . I 'd recommend trying to sell a product first , and if you see there 's a high demand for it or you plan to receive more orders for it , you could order a sample and see if it meets your expectations . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be able to sell , right ? <p> Shipping : I recommend you read this section on out Help Center : LONG ... It might look tricky at first , but its really easy . You just import products , and set up your shipping rates on Shopify . Most of the products on AliExpress are shipped worldwide , just make sure you double check the shipping prices to the countries you 'll sell the most . <p> Payments : In dropshipping , you get paid first and then pay your supplier to ship the products directly to your supplier . You get paid via the payment gateway you set up ( https : **34;0;TOOLONG ) , and pay your supplier via AliExpress with you credit card . <p> Yes but imagine.i push some shoes through to my storei have no idea who will buy them or where they will be shipped to ? How in gods name can i select a country to ship the product to ? This question applies to ALL products . Can you only choose one country and one shipping price for each product ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you choose the US as a shipping price and a buyer from Tokyo orders the product ! ? ! Will it just not be shipped ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> You should have an idea wholl buy from you " it will be hard to sell something to someone you do n't  know . <p> Oberlo does n't  work the way you think . You can import a product , and ship it to any country you want . Most of the AliExpress sellers sell worldwide and there wont be any problems with that . <p> When you select a shipping country on Oberlo product search , you can see how much it will cost you to ship that product to a particular destination . It does n't  mean that the product will only be shipped to that destination , its just a price check for a reference . So you do n't  sell a product that costs $100 to ship to the US . <p> However , that rarely happens . Most of the AliExpress sellers have free or almost free shipping worldwide . You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to all countries you plan to sell to . <p> Hi Tomas , Im Omar from the Netherlands , Despite I 'm a newbie to Oberlo I have read a lot about the app and I think I will go for it however , I have a question which it could be asked and answered before , the question is : I know that we can browse all the suppliers from AliExpress and add products to our stores directly from the app and even order the product for the customer but does that mean we do n't  need to do any initial contact by ( phone OR E-mail ) with every dropship supplier on our store before I start adding their products to my store ? I know I should do that if I want to make any arrangement for labeling or adding my logo of my store on the package but , in a normal situation would we still need to contact the supplier to introduce our self and try close a contract with supplier ? Thanks <p> Hey Omar ! Yes , you can import products without getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing to do , just to get a better understanding of how the supplier responds to your messages . <p> Michael Hulse <p> Hi <p> In regards to import duty of a country . I do n't  want customers receiving a parcel along with a bill for import duty . How can this be paid without the customer getting a surprise bill when an item is delivered ? <p> From my experience , customers rarely have to pay any customs charges . Usually , the packages consist a single low value item and do n't  qualify for any taxes . <p> Vanja <p> Since I own a few facebook page with a lot of followers , I am interested in selling some TV show/Tv personality products that I found on AliExpress . How do I know if those sellers have copyright license for t-shits , posters , etc ? <p> jfreemom <p> You can use your own images . You can take screenshots or create images and add those to the store . <p> what you do is you go to the oberlo settings and then go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for suppliers when you check out . To do this you have to have the oberlo extension installed tho . Then you fill in the note and when you order product for your customers , oberlo automatically sends the note to the supplier . <p> Alek Ivanov <p> Most of them do n't  . And even if they do , does n't  mean you do . I 'd avoid branded products in general . <p> Question : When I have a large list of imports on my storefront , how do I keep track of the product still being available on ali ? I do n't  want a customer to order an item I imported months ago only to find out its no longer available . <p> Cha Chi Diamat-Arzadon <p> love it <p> Nudge <p> Hi Had a go at doing this in the past . Have a quick question for you . When I sell an item on Ali Express , they send me message later saying " I am writing to confirm that if you received your order ? We have extended the protection time for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not the customer receiving the order , how can I confirm that the customer has received it ? <p> Gidon Lev Eli <p> Just ask the customer when do they get it <p> Nudge <p> So if you have hundreds of customers with thousands of products , you have to email each one to ask if they 've got their item . And if they have n't , you have to keep asking them ! I hope there 's an automation facility through Oberlo for that . <p> Davud <p> What happens if I have multiple suppliers ? Is there a way to have the supplier t create my own branded packaging ? <p> K Pk <p> Are you kidding , do you think Walmart wants to pay duty or custom fees when they bring all their sweatshop products here to sell ? I do n't  think so . In fact , the reason we have to dropship is because it costs us 10 times more to ship to our next door neighbor , then it does for someone to ship the same item from China . So no , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also do n't  have to pay duty or custom fees when we buy cheap crap directly from China . By the way , that e-package is a result of a handshake deal made between eBay China and eBay Hong Kong , and our very own USPS . Funny how our rates are the only ones going up . Do you see what I see ? <p> Mario Flores <p> When selecting the shipping country ( United States ) most of the quotes are between 10-30 days and can cost as much as $30 $40 . Is that the amount of time my customers should expect to wait to receive their product ? is that $30-40$ truely the cost of shipping a single item ? I am beginning to think I am interpreting the information wrong , or looking at suppliers that are truly unreasonable to use for U.S sales . <p> Virlyn <p> If you are dropshipping small items , you can use ePacket shipping method . It usually cost under $5 = <p> Stoian Kirov <p> Hi there . I see that there was a discussion about the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several suppliers and they all say the same : The Chinese customs require an address and a price on the packaging and there is no way to remove them . So the customer will see that the item comes from china and the price is lower . How do you handle that problem ? <p> Maurice Nyongesa <p> what happens to dropshippers who deliver their products to buyers ib 3-7 days when most of the shipping is done between 7-60 days ? <p> Maurice Nyongesa <p> i think Alibaba is a pure wholesale store wgere goods have MOQ but AliExpress i look at it as a retaile shop where you can order for just a single item and is shipped to the address given to them . Is it so Tomas ? <p> Maurice Nyongesa <p> i think another way to help do that is when you see an item on your store being orded so much you can order it in large numbers to your store and then you brand them to ship them to your customers though i think it may be different from dropshipping but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So Thomas I just snipe out the products and do all adjustments n push to shopify . Any other questions just communicate via oberlo n suppliers will receive them . Thanks <p> Matthew Bourdon <p> What do you do if you do n't  sell enough to order the MOQ ? And what happens if your customer does not get their product for 3-4 weeks and is upset ? That 's really the only thing holding me back from drop shipping . <p> Anita Gurreri <p> Hey , I have to admit that they do indicate the lower price on the packages have you found a way to bypass it ? <p> Brandi Michelle <p> have you actually used this option ? <p> Mia Butter <p> and what about pictures with " Aliexpress " watermarks ? ? Do we need to request to every suppliers the original pictures ? ? <p> Steve Sabol <p> so how I do I ship a large number of items from an aliexpress supplier to a large number of customers ? Do I need to input their addresses in all individually ? How does that work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , login into Oberlo and check the video tutorials . There 's a video about autoresponders ( Settings &gt; Auto Update ) . There you 'll be able to setup setting for product stock , price changes and other things . <p> Ajeet Pratap Maurya <p> Hi Tomas , I am using Oberlo for my dropshipping . I have talked to many suppliers and they all say that : The Chinese customs require an address and a price on the packaging and there is no way to remove them . So the customer will see that the item comes from china and the price is lower . If I am charging $5 on my store and the actual product is $2.5 , I do n't  want my customer to see that the proctor cost them $2.5 How do you handle that problem ? <p> Baltazar Borja <p> Have they found a way to bypass it yet ? <p> Sherry <p> What happens when a customer has a dispute on an product , would they return the product to me and then I send it to the supplier ? <p> Jose Posada <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to know if OBERLO work with different suppliers other than Aliexpress ? <p> Robbie Pomare <p> Good afternoon . I have recently gone live with my store but have found it very confusing with shipping rates . So what I 've done is made free shipping worldwide and incorporated shipping into the product . But now I see a few comments on here regarding stringent policy from China ( Chinese customs require an address and a price on the packaging and there is no way to remove them . So the customer will see that the item comes from china and the price is lower ) . How frustrating is this . At the moment my brain is fried but refuse to give up . As the saying goes 2 heads better than 1 . Any new ideas anyone ? ? ? ? ? <p> Slavik <p> Did you ask them whether it 's possible to put your price on a package instead of theirs original price ? <p> Sacha Williams <p> hello can someone help me im just new hear <p> Sacha Williams <p> how on earth do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> do i come back on thursday <p> Sacha Williams <p> help if someone can be bothered its very overwhelming is this normal ? ? <p> Nicole <p> Hey Sacha , what did you need help with ? <p> Sacha Williams <p> How does it work if you only have afew dolllars to spend ie you have to have money to make money ? ? ? ?

Google is good for finding things , so whatever you 're wanting to know about , just Google that term . You will find a lot of video links with tutorials on what you want to know ( under the video heading at the top of the search results ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook ads . See if you can find others to get another viewpoint from someone else , who may cover things that this person may have missed . https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zT8w8-buzjM try to find recent videos , because Facebook changes things from time to time and the older videos may show you different page navigation in the Facebook ad manager . The above video is from April 2016 . In any case , the principle of how to do your ads remains the same . <p> Iris Abramov <p> My account is suspended , I contacted Aliexpress few times but they did n't  solve anything . I cant open dispute and purchase protection is running out for few of my orders . And I 'm waiting more than 2 mounts for the orders even delivery for my country is 17 to 25 days . They are scamming people . When they notice that you did n't  receive your order and that purchase protection is running out they will block your account just so they do n't  need to make the refund . And they will also block possibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products are filtered and scam also . AVOID ! <p> Maktub E Basta <p> It happened the same to me <p> Shawna Harris <p> I am fairly new to this . I have a site set up and now i am switching dropshippers . I have t shirt designs and I want to start using the Obelo/Aliexpress to add the designs to shirts and other items and ship through my website . I keep reading all these articles about how easy it is , but no link to actually find the dropshippers who let you personalize the shirts and things .. anyone know what i 'm trying to say ? ! <p> Nona Mandy <p> What happens during the Chinese new year and 11.11 ? Do we need to alert our customers there will be delays ? <p> Christa Grant <p> I am wondering how to connect my Shopify to AliExpress so they get the orders . Do I use the Custom Order Fulfillment option ? What email do I put in ? <p> Thanks <p> Elesha Celcer <p> I 'm doing the same thing right now . I 'm using Oberlo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " chrome extensions " and find Oberlo . Get that and then log into your Shopify account and look on the left side for Apps . Click it , then click Oberlo and then connect your store by adding your store name in the appropriate field . <p> Elesha Celcer <p> All the forums and blogs that I read indicate nothing can be done . Most people rip their packages open anyway and do n't  pay attention to such labels . <p> Elesha Celcer <p> Have you found any avenues for this yet ? Im interested as well . I 'm sure you have heard of Tspring but I recently found out about Merch by Amazon . Have you checked that out ? <p> Elesha Celcer <p> Sacha , where have you started ? I 'm new too . Do you have an online store set up ? <p> Elesha Celcer <p> You are n't  using epacket ? I think epacket comes with tracking info . <p> More Zulanda <p> Great Article Thomas , However I have a couple of questions . 1 ) Apart from Aliexpress , where else can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great fitness supplements supplier to dropship . I do n't  trust aliexpress for this . <p> Rollin Shultz <p> Although it is realistic to not want your customer to know what you pay for a product , idk , why you would want to conceal the fact it is made in China and ships from China . People are not stupid , they will see the same products on Ebay and Amazon . By now anyone with a brain knows it is a given that items from China take a month to arrive , give or take . Honesty about product origination and quality will increase your reputation , while dishonesty will brand you as untrustworthy . That being said , most of my suppliers from Aliexpress and Banggood rarely include any kind of invoice in the packaging . Your other choice is to begin ordering some of your cheaper items in bulk and then you can list them as shipped from USA . I look for that description often while browsing Ebay listings . I am slowly building my own stock and I can even take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing options . Good luck to you . <p> Rollin Shultz <p> Are you ordering name brand items ? I deal in electronics and none of my items has any labeling , pricing , or even an invoice inside , but outside there will be an address , especially for Epacket , because that is subsidized by the US postal service . <p> Shawna Harris <p> No , I have not . I was using Scaleable , but their shipping options are too expensive . $10 to US ! Now I 'm still confused of how to get my designs to dropshiippers on Aliexpress , and my messages to them have gone unanswered ! <p> Bill Paulk <p> can someone recommend a good AliExpress suppler when it comes to jewelry , caps , sunglasses , and tshirts ? <p> Bill Paulk <p> WHat I have learned is to communicate with the supplier . If they immediately respond , they are mostly trust worthy . Its better to buy in bulk and you make the shipment . It only guarantees that your customer will get what you want them to get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical plastic bag . You do the math . <p> Bill Paulk <p> Take for example . If i have a 1 carat diamond . I ship it in a plastic bag . What do you think the value is to the customer even if its the same value compared to a ring box with velvet. ? <p> Kae Cherdsak <p> Do we need API Key to interface Aliexpress store ? <p> mcskeech <p> I 'm new too , but so far the only way Ive seen to do that is to go to each individual T-shirt supplier on Ali Express and read their ad . It will say if it can be personalized . I do n't  know if that means to put a logo or the same thing on each shirt , or personalized with someones name or what but if you email the supplier in the ad , they should be able to tell you . You might also be able to do a search at the top of Ali Express that specifically states what you are looking for and it might bring them up . <p> Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid low price and labeling on the epacket please help <p> Princess Pleasure <p> am having the same issues . they tell you they can not take out the original price of the goods <p> Derek Arceus Rohde <p> I have shipped thousands of items and only had 1 or 2 people complain about this . I think it is common knowledge that companies do this to reduce customs charges . If customer ask , tell them just that . <p> Brien White <p> following <p> Bill Paulk <p> The discussion concerning the price and the Chinese writing on the packaging is nothing but another way of forcing you to purchase bulk . It depends on how much you value a returning customer . Do you have it shipped in a tacky package , or packaging that supports the item . IS you cubic zirconia more valuable in a plastic bag or a 2 dollar ring case ? Some food for thought . <p> Awen <p> Hello everyone , I am a seller from China , I have a trade company , I 'm so glad to find this website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be glad to help you if you have any questions , like the products you want to sell , the shipping method and cost etcI am looking forword to finding some partners here.Thank you <p> Awen <p> Hello Bill , my name is Awen , I 'm from China.I used to have an Aliexpress store for myself , but unfortunately I close it because I was too busy.But now reopen one need charge over $2000 fees per year , so I hesitate that open or not.But now I find another way , dropshipping.I think its a very good way that find some partners who have a shopify store or other online stores.I can help them to ship by traceable post mail or express . <p> Awen <p> 11 <p> Awen <p> Hello Mark , I am a seller from China , my name is Awen.I understand what you concern.You are right , the standard lables will have Chinese , its unmodifiable .

Just to be sure If we add in the oberlo app to our suppliers note section that we want plain packing they will not put the pricing etc on the packages ? <p> Grey Stone <p> what i simply do n't  get is , what is Oberlos role in all thus ? if we have to contact the supplier ourselves and see if they dropship or not <p> M.nimalist Services <p> Dear Awen , Im interested to know what items you are offering . Can you provide me with your email address so that i can contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell your products in the U.S. even though you 're based in Malaysia . That 's what a lot of dropshippers do ! <p> Diana <p> Hi Tomas , but if we are based out of Asia , and we are targeting to sell to U.S , how do we deal with returns ? Customers will have to return their damaged product to our office ( address in Asia ) , do you know of any workaround ? Thanks ! 
@@12738166 @1338166/ <h> The psychology of shipping - what 's your experience ? <h> spbub <p> I have n't opened my shop yet , but as of now I plan to free shipping via ePacket with 25 day guarantee of arrival . I 'm being sure to be very clear and honest about the shipping time . Also , most of my suppliers provide ePacket shipping for free , so providing free shipping does n't hurt my profits at all . <p> I am currently playing around with the idea offering a lower end free shipping option estimates delivery at 25 days with tracking but without the above guaranteed . I 'd offer a paid shipping option that would be cheap , $3 or so , and would a shipping estimate of 12-20 days with tracking and a 20 day guarantee . My theory is that not offering options makes even people feel uncomfortable and less in control , even if they were going to choose the free option in the first place . <p> I also wonder if people who chose the free option more patient for delivery since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It places the responsibility on them rather than my store . Blackmilkclothing.com is an Australian company that kind of does this : it offers free Standard International shipping delivery estimate 1-4 weeks with no tracking and claiming no liability for missing packages . They also offer $10 Standard International shipping with tracking and liability for missing packages . <p> Since most of my suppliers offer free ePacket shipping I 'd probably send the products that way regardless of the shipping option the customer chooses , so the customer who chose the free shipping option would get their package quicker than they expected . Meanwhile , the customer who chose the paid option would have a guaranteed date of arrival . <p> Any thoughts on this ? Has anyone experimented with this ? <h> cpaulson <p> spbub Sounds like a solid plan ! I love BlackMilk and have a few pairs of their leggings . I 'm playing with my shipping times and am struggling with my shipping policy <p> rjlarge How reliable is epacket in getting to customers on the time frame ? <p> I see other dropshippers giving time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 8 weeks to get , way longer than what they said . I want to be transparent as well but do n't know if saying that its going to take 8 weeks to get is going to help my cause or even get me orders . <h> TaniaRe <p> spbub The only problem i see with this is that most Aliexpress sellers offer fast shipping options ( DHL , EMS ) but the prices are around $33 - $50 .. I do n't see anyone paying too much for shipping , neither i can cover the costs ( except if you sell high margin products ) . <h> rjlarge <p> This is a very interesting idea ! The only thing that would worry me is that Aliexpress/ EMS does have a record of having the occasional package going MIA . I have 2 right now that are being disputed . But right now I am giving refunds anyway if a customer complains and the package/tracking has been sitting idle to long , so the extra shipping cost could be a good way of going too ......... interesting , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> spbub <p> I 'll let you know how it goes if I try it out ! In cases of missing package I 'm thinking I would refund the customer regardless of shipping option they choose even though it 's not guaranteed . It seems like a good way to under promise and over deliver . <h> rjlarge <p> @spbub Hmmmm ...... in any case I think I might ad some kind of guaranteed delivery in my descriptions . Sure ca n't hurt the trust factor : - ) <h> rjlarge <p> @cpaulson In my experience if you have a good seller and they send it e-packet most of my customers get their packages in 12-15 days ....... the main problem I see is the occasional seller that says e-packet , will even pay a premium for e-packet and then it gets sent by something like small packet or something . Thank God that has n't  happened to often to me , but it does happen . I usually will express my displeasure and never use them again ! <h> Vince <p> rjlarge I actually just went through this experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refund dispute for the first time ever ( on one of my best suppliers too ! ) . I feel bad about it but there is n't much I can do since I had to refund the customer immediately . It 's actually a customer that 's ordered several times on my store and he 's been completely patient with everything . <p> I was second-guessing whether to open a dispute or not with the supplier because even for ePacket , this item is well over 30 days now with no updates whatsoever besides the last known confirmation of shipment from China . I hope it does n't ruin my relationship with this particular supplier . I worry about these things . <h> rjlarge <p> @Vince I understand ! I just had to do the same thing ! I gave my seller an extra week and still nothing , but I feel like if you never dispute for missing packages or quality issues , they wo n't have much reason to improve . I have what I feel is a pretty good relationship with a couple suppliers , I think for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a living just like we are : - )

@@12738171 @1338171/ <p> You can not successfully market your eCommerce store today without using social media . The benefits of social media marketing are enormous , and the best part is that it does n't even take a huge commitment of your time or resources to pull it off ! In short , social media marketing is tailor-made for small online businesses that need to use their resources wisely . <p> As a small online business , you do n't have a big ad budget " that 's just a fact . You also do n't have unlimited man hours to advertise your business because you rightly have to worry about making sure your startup runs smoothly . When you factor in the extra work that small business owners always have to do anyway , the time and effort commitment to marketing seems daunting . <p> Again , that 's where social media can come to the rescue for your eCommerce store ! All it takes is a few hours every week , an active account on big social networks like Facebook and Instagram , knowing who your target audience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the benefits of social media marketing . <h> Much better brand loyalty from your customers due to the benefits of social media marketing <p> The thing about social media is that it 's a way to directly connect with your eCommerce customers . The more you connect with them because of your social-media presence , the more highly they will think of your brand . <p> As soon as your customers interact with your brand more and form a better impression of you , other good things happen ! For example , according to Convince and Convert , 53% of people who follow a brand on social media end up being more loyal to that brand . There you have it ! When social media is a facilitator between brands and customers , it is a surefire way to strengthen brand loyalty as well . <p> Here is the key , though : - you ca n't expect to have brand loyalty suddenly appear out of the blue . If you only curate your social media channel infrequently and do n't personally address or reply to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty weak , even if you are using social media . <p> So remember that more brand loyalty is indeed one of the benefits of social media marketing , but only if you share valuable content with your customers regularly . <h> More traffic to your website <p> Your eCommerce site is where your conversions and sales happen . Social media is only one of your inbound marketing tools to get your leads and customers to your site for conversions and sales , and it works very well . <p> On every social network " whether that 's Facebook , Instagram or Twitter " your eCommerce store will always have a backlink to your online store right on your brand 's account page . This is how your leads and visitors will find your site through social mediaif your content is excellent . <p> Generally , you want to send more traffic to your site by using the 80/20 rule of social media , which states that you should share 80% high-quality content and resources for your customers in your industry while only sharing self-promotional content 20% of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic coming to your site . The more social shares your content gets , the higher your eCommerce store is actually going to rank for its keyword in search engine results pages ( SERPs ) . And the higher any individual page on your site or blog ranks in the SERPs , the more people will see it , click on it , and visit your online store ! <h> Newsjacking for extra attention ; another of the benefits of social media marketing <p> Newsjacking is essentially when you align your social media activity with a very hot , trending topic on social media . Newsjacking works because you amplify your own marketing message by referencing and riding on the coattails of a news story that many people outside your industry are already paying attention to on social media . <p> Simply look at the trending stories on Facebook or Twitter . You 'll always be able to easily jump on a particularly hot story , provided that you can somehow work it into an angle for your eCommerce business . <p> The only word of caution is that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media content with a trending story ! After all , the lifecycle of any news story is only usually very short , lasting a day or two , so it 's in the best interest of your online store if you jump on the news story near the beginning of its news cycle . <p> If you do this technique right , you 'll be able to capitalize on the heightened interest of said news story that you 'll see in the form of extra traffic to your online store . <p> It never hurts to think of clever ways to capitalize on a hot news story and find an angle for your brand " and then share it on social media ! <h> Give a boost to your SEO efforts <p> These days , SEO is n't just about optimizing your site , individual pages , and blog . Social media has become an important signal that plays a role in either positively or negatively affecting your SEO rankings , according to none other than Google 's Matt Cutts . In other words , according to your social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Google on whether or not you 're a trustworthy source on the Internet ! <p> Therefore , since social signals are so valued in Google 's algorithms , having an active and regularly curated social account on Facebook and Instagram can noticeably help your SEO rankings . Why would n't you want to use social media for this purpose since the investment is very small to begin with ? <p> Your online store occupies just one tiny corner on the huge , vast web . If your social media posts and shares help get your store more attention to people on search engines , then it 's a no-brainer . <h> The benefits are many , and the effort is relatively little <p> We get it . You 're a small eCommerce business owner . Your budget is n't big , so you have to be smart and discerning with what you spend money on . You ca n't spend a lot for ads , and you definitely do n't have the money to hire people to run elaborate marketing campaigns for you ! Your solution is social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very promising . All it takes is a small commitment . <p> As we 've shown you , using social media to market your online store is n't complicated . Nor does it take a lot of time and money . If you can understand the basics involving newsjacking , social signals , and regular curation , you are already a step ahead of other small business owners .

Thank you in advance . <h> Audriusp <p> If you have the auto-update feature enabled for your product prices and inventory it means that product prices and inventory may change in accordance to AliExpress supplier .

@@12738206 @1338206/ <h> The best practices for determining the price of a product ? <h> paulpl <p> I have a question regarding best practices for determining the price of a product . As you have said it 's best if the product falls in the &lt;30 category because of the impulsive nature of a purchase . <p> However , I have also read your comments on Quora regarding Facebook costs per click . In a hypothetical situation , where the cpc is $0.20-0.40 and 20,000 people click on my ad , I would pay $4000-$8000 for the ads . Assuming an average conversion rate of 2.5% ( 500 of 20,000 ) I would need each customer to spend at least $8-$16 to break even . I would also need to add the cost of goods purchased from a supplier to the Facebook ads customer acquisition cost . If I got my product from aliexpress for , say $12 , I would automatically need to add between $8-$16 to the base price to break even . Anything more than that is my profit . <p> This assumes that each customer buys only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approx. cost per acquisition by combining the average conversion rate and the average CPC . <p> Once you get that value , add it + profit on top of your products cost to break even . <p> The lower the price , the harder it gets to sell a product with Facebook . Adding $8-16 CPA on $1 earrings does n't make a lot of sense . So I suggest you have 1-2 products that you use in your direct response advertising and use other cheaper products for upselling and cross-selling . <p> Hope that thelps ! <h> internetmoneys <p> I would say yes and no . <p> First off your conversion rate should n't be 2.5% or you may want to find a different product . I have had conversion rates of 11.5% using the free product just pay shipping method back in January and even after switching to selling traditional products with a price , i.e. $19.95 , my conversion rate was at its lowest 4.5% and yesterday after three months of biweekly optimization is up to 7.35% . <p> Secondly you are ignoring the unpaid organic or trickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more so other channels amounts to a huge amount of purchases . <p> Third is like you said on average ( for me at least ) 8% of people buy more than one thing . Similar to this you also have a huge value in having a customers email address , knowing the product they purchased and being able to email them related products . Abandoned catt emails also add up . Lastly , retargetting is also in this category and although it is hard to predict ROI for all of these things its safe to assume they will add up to a 20-50% boost in your sales from running an example facebook campaign like you said . <p> You should also probably calculate a 5% at least return rate and maybe much higher depending on your product . Returns are also more expensive for dropshipping specifically because we are out the money paid by the customer and the cost we paid our supplier to ship the product . Also since for the most part it makes no sense for we as dropshippers to try and handle fulfillment i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us than a typical ecommerce store . <p> The last thing I would say you forgot is the payment processor fees charged by Shopify and Paypal as well as the affiliate commissions from Oberlo . Although these seem like small amounts , i.e. fees are usually 4% of sales for me personally , if you do n't  factor them into your ad spend and ROI they can really surprised you in how quickly they add up and how much it takes from your bottom line . <p> Anyway sorry this post is megalong but I hope it helps you or someone ! <h> internetmoneys <p> I just reread your post and I realized I do n't  even think I ever answered your original question about prices . <p> Briefly , my experience with setting prices has taught me to definitely experiment with prices and always remember that a higher price does not equal better profit <p> A few quick examples : <p> I was selling one fashion product for 19.95 and conversions were I think around 3% . When I changed the price to 29.95 conversions jumped to 5% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense they thought it would be a crappy product so they did n't  buy it . <p> I have found in general setting my prices higher say $19.95 and offering free shipping works much better then setting a price of say 14.95 and charging $5 for shipping . <p> Last tip I would say is I have also found that sometimes setting the price higher again but using a widespread discount code does well . So in your ad give a code for 20% off and set your price higher to match that . <p> Anyway bottom line is prices are something that is so specific to product and your audience the best advice I can say is you should test everything and assume nothing . Hope that helps !

After we did this any clicking on the color to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and removing the new images does not fix it . <p> Can you suggest what this might be ? <p> many thanks for your product too , its awesome . <h> RutaGanusauskaite <p> It 's hard to detect the problem without looking into your account . Could you send us an email at hello@oberlo.com explaining the problem together with your store 's URL ? My team will look into it and get back to you with fixes . <p> Thanks ! <h> rgbonline <p> HI there thanks so much for the reply and getting things in progress . We done quite a few trials and the issues continued but the more we were troubleshooting the more we realised the problem was after import from Oberlo and publishing it to our store . We reached out to the support guys for our template and they " fixed it " with no explanation why they had made changes earlier in the past 24 hours that caused it to stop working , . We still have some issues but feel confident that they are all a side effect of the code changes the theme guys are making .

I 'm using Oberlo to populate my Shopify Store and I am struggling with establishing a Shopify selling price for my products . I 'm not sure if I should include the EPacket charge in with the vendor 's discounted or the vendor 's non-discounted price of the product . Example : Widget 1 is selling on Aliexpress for $0.50 ( discounted 50% ) ; the EPacket charge is $2.44 . So , to properly cover a potential product increase in the vendor 's price ( say it returns to $1.00 ) and the EPacket Charge of $2.44 , my selling price would be $3.44 x 10 = $34.44 ... I 'm using 10 as multiplier ( Auto multiplier setup ) for items from 0 to $1.00 but the auto multiplier calculates it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $0.50 I mentioned above ) . That would be 10 x $0.50 = $5.00 and much more reasonable . <p> So , I 'm thinking the EPacket fee will be marked as a separate line item my customer sees ... Am I correct on this ?

@@12738227 @1338227/ <h> Economics of Facebook Ads <h> lwald <p> Hi Everyone , <p> I 'm about a week into starting my first Oberlo/Shopify shop ( www.bluecloudkites.com ) and have been using Facebook ads to drive traffic to the website . Thing is , based on cost of Facebook ads I 'm experiencing , I 'm questioning how anyone can profitably run a Facebook ad campaign . I 've outlined my CPC and conversion rates below in an example which would suggest I 'd need to make somewhere between $40-75 profit off each sale just to breakeven on Facebook ads . It feels like I must be missing something because of everyone else 's success stories here . Is anyone else having a similar experience to me ? What am I missing ? I 'd be interested in hearing other users ' stats across three metrics : <p> 1 ) Facebook Conversions : # of clicks for 1,000 impressions of Facebook Ads ( posts seem to suggest you should be happy with &gt;1% conversion of an impression to a click ) <p> 2 ) CPC : $ per click on Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) Shop Conversions : Percentage of shop visitors that make a purchase ( posts seem to suggest you should be happy with 1-2% conversion ) <p> With a CPC of $0.74 , if you 're successful at your shop of converting 1-2% of your visitors into buyers , then it 's going to cost you $37-74 in Facebook ads per buyer which seems insanely high . <p> Even if you drop my CPC to Facebook 's average ( $0.2729 ) , it 's still going to cost you $13-27 in Facebook ads per buyer . This just does n't seem right to me. <h> crankandspintackle <p> I think it 's important to keep in mind that the goal of facebook ads is multi-functional . If you 're marketing products you can invite the people who like your post to like your page , which reduces your overall cost for future campaigns ( you 're not marekting to the same people ) . Additionally , if you look at the CPC of a single post and how it converts to sales for your site - you have to keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds ( which are really hard to track ) . I 've found that having a social audience is well worth the money - once you hit page likes above 1k you can actually target " like " accounts which make targeting much more effective . <h> lwald <p> Thanks for the reply and understood that there are future benefits down the road that should help to reduce the effective spend over time . I was just talking to Facebook support and learned something else . The " clicks " showing up in Facebook Ads are n't exclusively clicks to your website . If there 's any action taken from your ad ( e.g. someone going to your Facebook page ) , it 's captured , so the CPC for traffic to your website is far greater . <p> Is there anyone out there that runs a website profitably primarily off driving traffic through Facebook Ads ?

@@12738229 @1338229/ <h> What is click-through rate ( CTR ) ? <p> Click-through rate ( CTR ) is a performance metric expressed in percentages that measures the amount of times an ad or email is clicked versus the amount of times it 's been viewed ( impressions ) . It is most commonly used to measure the effectiveness of paid search , display and email marketing campaigns and can indicate the performance of ad copy , subject lines , and meta data ( titles and descriptions ) . <h> How is click-through rate calculated ? <p> To determine the click-through rate of your campaign , you need to divide the number of total impressions by the number of total clicks and multiply by 100 .

@@12738235 @1338235/ <p> Emily Warkentin is the startup founder of www.pointtwomaps.com . Her company sells unique maps of popular cities and countries around the world that you can use for your home decor . She and her classmate Owen started the business as they were constantly using maps for their school assignments . After they graduated , they decided to decorate their walls with maps that told a story , so they decided to design their own . Soon after friends were asking about their designs which eventually led to the start of their business . They have countless maps to choose from and even create custom maps for those whose cities have n't been mapped out yet . <p> We sat down with Emily to speak about her ecommerce journey so far , so you can learn more about this industry . <h> What 's been your biggest accomplishment with any of your online stores ? <p> Emily Warkentin : Honestly , the biggest accomplishment in my mind was building- up the courage to quit our day jobs and commit to our business full time . It was terrifying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole source of income . We tested the market for several months and through almost every avenue we could think of and with a positive response all around , we felt that with a ton of hard work and thoughtful , we could make this a full-time job with an equivalent income . And we did ! We are beyond lucky to get do the work that we do . <p> Once we officially launched our business , we knew we wanted to handle our product as little as possible . The more that business owners are involved with their product , manufacturing , ordering , packaging , you name it , the less efficient profit margins can be . So , we dedicated much of our time to figuring out how to automate as much of our business as possible . We decided early on that we did n't want to hold any inventory of our prints . We dislike the idea of producing more than we know we can sell which we feel can be very wasteful and we also wanted to ensure that our customers get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business with a print-on-demand structure . We also rely heavily on software . We use software for shipping , fulfillment , task management , and nearly every aspect of our e-commerce store is managed with time-saving software . This allows each member of our team to focus on what they do best : design and customer service . <p> But each of our biggest successes so far has been the result of letting go of the fear of embarrassment and just asking . Ask over and over and over again until you find your answer , or you fully understand the task at hand . This mentality has lead to our biggest shipping discounts , our best hires , our most efficient fulfillment partnerships and our largest spikes in growth . If you want something , just ask for it . You just might get it . <h> What has been your biggest challenge ? <p> Emily Warkentin : Biggest challenge ? That 's a tough one . Being an entrepreneur and working for yourself is full of challenges . When you make up your own business goals and sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to keep checking that you 're on the right track . We 've learned that we need to be constantly regrouping and coming back to our goals . But I would have to say that our biggest challenges have been surrounding finances and marketing . These are two fields that are in neither of our natural skill set , so we struggle to get the numbers right and the marketing targeted . <p> In terms of finances specifically , we did n't separate ourselves from the business fast enough . By that I mean , almost every bootstrapped business starts out as a sole-proprietorship , or some derivative of that , and your personal and business finances are one in the same . When we incorporated the business early on , we took longer than needed to separate all the bank accounts and this left us in the dark a little bit in terms of how much of our assets we could dedicate towards expansion projects . We know now that we should have visited our local small business support center for guidance as to how to properly set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much smoother . We 've also learned the importance of hiring an accountant you trust and who has experience working with other businesses of similar size . A good accountant will not only be able to prepare your books properly but also analyze your number and explain how well you are doing , where you might be able to afford some risks . <p> As for marketing , this one also follows a similar principle to hiring a professional to handle your books . This year was a huge year of growth for our business . We transitioned from hobby project to a thriving business with assets in the bank . We knew that we needed to take our marketing more seriously if we were to increase the pace at which we were growing . So we were faced with a dilemma . Back in the early days of the business , we had very little working capital and needed to bootstrap every aspect of our work . If there was something that needed to get done , we spent our evenings researching new skills after the regular work day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , we jumped right into learning all about digital marketing . This was a huge mistake . While we wholeheartedly believe in small business bootstrapping in the beginning as this proves your passion for the work and controls the pace at which you grow and take on risks , small business needs to learn to recognize the value of their time . The deeper we went with our digital marketing research , the more we realized that this was such a huge and complicated task and that our time would be better served designing new products and fine tuning our customer service experience , not learning about Facebook pixels and look-alike audiences . So once again , we handed it over to the professionals . We now work with paxtonprojects.com and Jack Paxton has really changed the game for us in terms of gaining exposure for our business . <h> What strategy or tactic has been your biggest money maker ? <p> Emily Warkentin : - Instead of watching Netflix at the end of the day , one of my favorite things to do it check out new apps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available as add-ons to both a Shopify store as well as in-house management tools . Whenever we think we need to potentially hire someone to complete a repetitive task , such as resizing images for our 13,000+ SKUs , we can almost always find some software to help us complete part , if not all , of the task . This has been one of the biggest money makers in our business so far . When you are small , peoples ' time is the most expensive part of running and growing a business . <p> Similarly , we 've found that specialization has been one of our most positive strategies . In the early days , we were making , packaging and shipping orders ourselves . I spent way too much time on the phone with USPS hunting down packages for customers , only to get pulled into researching better pricing for our packaging . My days were very inefficient and I should have been spending this time improving our internal communication system or writing better copy for our website . This is just an example , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major time saver , which ultimately saves/make you money . Find people or business that can take over what you are struggling with and that specialize in those tasks . Because they are focused on those tasks , they are most likely getting better pricing and tighter turnaround times than you are . We take full advantage of this efficiency in many aspects of our work . <p> Emily Warkentin : - The biggest piece of advice we could offer to someone just starting out would be to bootstrap your business . I know that venture capital and investment rounds are attractive and sound sexy , but do n't be discouraged if this does n't happen for your business . Bootstrapping things , in the beginning , is one of the most sure-fire ways to ensure a level of growth that you are comfortable with that is sustainable for your particular product . We bootstrapped everything and still do . In the beginning , we used every little bit of profit to re-invest into the business , improving one aspect at a time . Some months we would focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital to test out a new automation software or hire a programmer to re-formulate our SKU structure when we knew we had outgrown the original . By not relying on investors , we maintain total control of our business and we love having the freedom to pivot our goals , try out a new product line or take time off for a vacation . <p> We feel that the most important lesson for a small business is to learn to take many risks , but small ones that you can afford to fail . When you are working with smaller amounts of extra capital to test out a new project , if a risk does n't turn out how you 'd hoped , your business wo n't fall flat . At most you 're out a bit of cash and you 're ready to try something different with the new knowledge you 've gained . <p> Who are your favorite startup founders ? What do you love about them ?

The essence of drop shipping is that you can sell products you do n't actually own by partnering with manufacturers who fulfill the orders for you . Because of the low startup costs and the fact that you do n't need to purchase any inventory upfront , drop shipping is one of the most popular methods and is , therefore , a very competitive playing field . <h> Just-in-time inventory <p> Just-in-time ( JIT ) inventory refers to an alternative method of stock control , which focuses on reducing spending and improving business competitiveness by ordering and receiving inventory exactly when it 's needed and neither sooner nor later . <p> JIT system is driven by the objective to reduce costs related to inventory maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it as well as waste costs .

You can think of user research as a more focused type of market research , which concerns itself with targeting the right audience and tailoring the whole experience to a certain segment of potential customers . Knowing user expectations and gearing the whole user experience towards meeting and exceeding them automatically contributes to increased conversion rates . <p> Improved customer retention . If users feel that your site completely understands their behavior and makes their interaction and navigation smooth and enjoyable , they will continue coming back because why would they want to go anywhere else ? Helping your users reach their goals quickly and in the most delightful way possible significantly reduces the churn rate and builds loyalty . <p> Customer referrals . Customer recommendations are one of the most powerful selling and marketing tools available . However , besides focusing on enhancing the user experience of their site or product and utilizing the right incentives , businesses have little control over this aspect . Satisfied customers who enjoy your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends or leave positive reviews online . Delighting your customers in every step of their buying journey will ultimately help you generate more potential customers . <h> What makes for a good User Experience ? <p> When it comes to creating an enjoyable UX on an eCommerce site , there are several important aspects that stand out : <p> Easy navigation ( information architecture ) . User research will help you determine which categories are the most popular , so you can create logical structure of categories and subcategories to help shoppers find what they need faster . It 's also important to place the essential information ( product price , description , color/size options , image and video gallery ) above the fold on a product page and use the rest of the page to provide additional information , such as product reviews , shipping options , etc . <p> Adequate support . Ensuring a customer support agent is always available to answer customer 's questions and provide personalized support will increase customer satisfaction and help you reduce the bounce rate . Chat bots that utilize predictive technology can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' needs and deliver timely guidance during critical moments . <p> Hassle-free checkout process.Checkout page is the highest drop-off point on eCommerce sites . Sometimes it 's due to shopper indecisiveness , but more often than not it 's a result of a cluttered and complex checkout process . Minimizing the number of steps required to complete the purchase and offering the right selection of payment gateways are often the go-to solutions for checkout optimization . <p> User-friendly return policy . The service you provide after a purchase occurs is in a way even more important than the seamless buying experience . It is one of the main factors that will determine whether a customer returns . If you 're focused on wooing your shoppers with one-click purchasing , the returns policy should be just as simple and straightforward to maintain customer 's satisfaction . - <h> Ways to measure User Experience <p> If you 're not measuring user experience , you do n't understand the usability issues hindering your site 's performance . If you do n't understand them , you ca n't improve . There are a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the most popular ones include : <h> What is the difference between UX and UI ? <p> User experience focuses on the user , her overall experience and journey through the product , and concerns itself with meeting the exact needs of a customer .

@@12738247 @1338247/ <h> Why use Oberlo ? <h> jondude345 <p> Hey everyone , I made an observation and wanted to get some confirmation on this issue . Because Oberlo has an order limit on it 's free plan ( meaning I would have to purchase the plan in order to sell more product through Oberlo , correct me if I 'm wrong ) , could n't I just learn the suppliers through Oberlo , find the high quality products , go to AliExpress and locate the supplier/product , and finally add it to my Shopify site without using Oberlo 's plan and sell as many as I want this way ? <p> What 's keeping me to Oberlo , or what benefits does Oberlo have that would make me want to use its paid plan . Please correct me if I 'm missing something or if my understanding is inaccurate . Thanks guys ! <h> cpaulson <p> Well a few things that I like with Oberlo is that they keep track of the items , so you wo n't run into problems such as the item being sold out . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available you will have to deal with problems of refunds , explaining to customers that you do n't have it in stock anymore , and other headaches . Also , Oberlo can make it so that if a price goes up , it will make the price on your store go up so if an item you have went up by 4 dollars , you wo n't be out 4 dollars because it had already adjusted . Also , when you pay for an item the address will pop up and you do n't have to do it yourself . If you choose not to use Oberlo , the above problems can be avoided by continuously monitoring your products on Aliexpress , to look for price changes , how many items they have in stock , which items is no longer available , what sizes are out of stock etc , which in the future when your company is established could pose problems because you would have to monitor it plus fill orders which both could be very time consuming . Oberlo is basically a headache free useful tool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't work for oberlo , that 's just my opinion on why its good

Aloysius Chay &amp; Galvin Bay were working as professional poker players in China 's most extravagant city , Macau . Last year , they decided to trade one exciting and lucrative lifestyle for another by trying their hand as dropshipping entrepreneurs with the help of Oberlo . <p> They are now earning upwards of $60K each day , less than a year after starting their first store . We recently had the opportunity to pick their brains about the keys to achieving success with ecommerce . <h> Tell us how you got started in dropshipping e-commerce ? What were you doing before your successful drop shipping business ? <p> Before embarking as dropshipping e-commerce entrepreneurs in 2016 , we were earning a living as professional poker players in Macau . At the time , a friend of ours was already involved in running a dropshipping business , which planted the seed in our minds that this was a viable way to make money . <p> It was n't until May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing a future in dropshipping . By August , we were already expanding the business to a second store . Things really moved that quickly . <h> What were the main struggles in the beginning ? How did you overcome them ? <p> For us , the biggest challenge came in terms of product researchtrying to find the right product at the right time for the right market . This required a lot of learning by doing . In fact , we tested 20-30 products and failed before finally finding things that worked . Of course , the process was a big test to our motivation . But in the end , we were able to discover a level of perseverance and creativity that we did n't know we had . <p> While we certainly had to learn how to stomach these losses in the beginning , we kept our eyes on the big picture in order to maintain perspective . In comparison to more traditional business models that require major investments and can take years before finally taking off , dropshipping really is a much more straightforward way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . <p> Even though getting started took some trial and error , dropshipping is the ideal way to start your ecommerce business in a short amount of time with a minimal amount of money . Plus , all the effort you put in contains the promise of reaping major returns . <h> Do you remember your first sale and where it came from ? <p> We started out niche marketing jewelry in June of 2016 . While the initial sales were on the smaller side and we ultimately did n't end up breaking even , we learned a lot from this experience . It taught us that it helps to target a certain audience by country . <p> The prospect of growing and improving kept us moving forward with the business . After experimenting with jewelry , we tried selling all sorts of other products . After testing out a few new products and strategies , - we ultimately achieved the success we 're enjoying now . <p> Galvin Bay <h> Do you use Facebook Ads to market your store ? What has been your experience with Facebook Ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes , we like using Facebook advertising because it is a lot simpler than other ad platforms . All the necessary features for creating a successful ad campaign are integrated into a straightforward , user-friendly system . <p> Of course , as two guys who were just starting out within the world of e-commerce , we found that taking some time to explore different tutorials and courses on the subject really helped us to learn what we needed to know . We also consulted a lot of people in our own social circle . You 'd be surprised how much you can learn just by sitting down with friends who are also working on their own e-commerce businesses to exchange tips and ideas . <h> What keeps you motivated as an e-commerce entrepreneur ? <p> Naturally , being able to secure some extra income is a great incentive . More than that , though , being an entrepreneur is really fun ! There are so many new challenges and opportunities coming your way , offering the chance to continually grow and learn as a business owner and as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have so much control over our daily lives because our dropshipping business provides us with both the financial means and the free time to create the lifestyles we 've always wanted . E-commerce has changed so many lives , including our own , as well as those of our friends and families . <h> As an e-commerce entrepreneur , what is your sale-per-day record as a successful dropshipping business ? <p> Our best day of sales to date is at high 5 figures USD , and we will continue to grow to surpass the 6 figures mark . <h> As an e-commerce entrepreneur , what 's your top recommendation to new store-owners ? <p> Always keep in mind that fresh products are the lifeblood of any successful e-commerce business . If you 're going to go all out in any area of your shop , this would be it . Be willing to continually get creative and test out new items . Do n't skimp out here because the risk is worth the returns . <p> In addition , hire staff to assist you in your business operations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the growth of your company . And it 's always better to over-hire than it is to be understaffed . <p> In the end , hiring people to help will save you valuable time and money that you can put towards expanding your shop . Besides , as a business owner , your efforts are better spent focused on the big picture than on answering emails and processing orders . It 's best to prioritize the streamlining of your e-commerce/dropshipping processes right from the start . <p> Galvin Bay <h> How long have you used Oberlo ? <p> My business partner and I used the Oberlo app right from the very beginning . Good apps are essential for optimizing the productivity of a dropshipping ecommerce business . Shopify Apps are awesome because they are relatively cheap for the amount of value they bring to your shop . And of course , Oberlo is free when you first start out . <h> Why did you decide to use Oberlo ? <p> We decided to use Oberlo because it made dealing with dropshipping orders far simpler and more user friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5 minutes , but with the Oberlo app we can cut that time to as little as 30 seconds . On average , the entire fulfillment process goes about three times faster . Plus , the Oberlo app 's automation feature minimizes errors in handling tasks like entering the right customer details to each order . <h> What do you like about using Oberlo specifically ? <p> What sets Oberlo apart is its user friendliness . It has a very straightforward design and eliminates the need to type relevant order information manually . This saves a lot of time and significantly reduces room for error in processing orders . We can use the time we save to further expand our business , and generally improve customer satisfaction . <h> What are your favorite features about the Oberlo app ? <p> Definitely the semi-automatic fulfillment of orders on AliExpress ranks high on the list . Also , the app makes syncing order tracking numbers to Shopify virtually effortless . Oberlo allows me to make bulk payments where we can load up to 100 orders at a time and then pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful if you wish to delegate order payments to staff members because it makes this process so easy that just about anyone can learn to do it in no time . <h> Would you recommend Oberlo to a friend or colleague ? Why ? <p> For sure ! In fact , we think it 's the first product that anyone looking to make it in the world of dropshipping e-commerce should install . Doing so from the beginning is best because it 's not possible to retrospectively sync the store operations with the app later on . Oberlo also offers a free trial for those just getting started out so there 's really nothing to lose , and the savings in time and error are really invaluable . <p> Hope to see this in woocommerce soon oberlo app is an amazing app , the features and the great code are incredible to work with but the shopify marriage is a bad bad choice from them . if they release the wordpress version it will be non stop for oberlo team . they will get the real presence that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would like to see an overall survey of the median profitability for vendors using Oberlo . <p> Michael <p> That is pretty much how every internet marketer operates these days .

The idea gets noticed by the sharks and they have the resources to milk the idea dry long before the original dude ever gets to that point . I have seen this cycle time and time again . Every successful internet marketing campaign you see on the web these days was copied from somewhere else . <p> Any reason why these so successful people do not even mention their sites name in such articles ? <p> Xavi Glez Glle <p> Because then everyone would try to sell the exact same thing .

We decided to order some product to see the samples before selling . 2.5 weeks now and only 1 item has left china so far . I cant see this as a possible business , no way will customers wait 5-6 weeks for delivery in Europe .

That said , you 'd be surprised at how many cost-conscious people out there , who would n't mind waiting the extra time to have their product delivered if it means getting a better deal . Dropshippers often counteract the downside of long delivery times by offering free shipping . This automatically tells your customer that it 'll likely take a little longer to receive their product .

There has be an email notification or SMS feature . Loosing traffic and sales can be detrimental to startups . <h> JKeitsuSorenson <p> Best thing to do is set your inventory levels yourself or do n't let shopify track inventory .

Just imagine if you have 100 products and 20 of them has a price change of $0.05 ( which does happen quite often ) .

There are around 70 items still in transit and if any one of them does n't deliver , I 'll have to refund customer and pay it with my own pocket . I contacted AE customer support , and they were very unhelpful . They could only tell me that my account has been terminated and there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure AliExpress is n't the one to be blamed here .

Europe and USA has a pretty good postal system . <p> The postal system here is notorious for delays and packets getting lost .

@@12738260 @1338260/ <h> What is eCommerce ? <p> eCommerce refers to any form of business transaction conducted online . The most popular example of eCommerce is online shopping , which is defined as buying and selling of goods via the internet on any device . However , eCommerce can also entail other types of activities , such as online auctions , payment gateways , online ticketing , and internet banking . <p> eCommerce is the fastest growing retail market projected to hit $4.058 trillion in sales in 2020 . Mobile commerce , or mcommerce , is a rapidly growing new avenue of eCommerce that 's mostly driven by the expanding market and influence of smartphones and millennials ' comfort with shopping online . In 2016 , the mcommerce sector enjoyed a 39.1% increase in sales compared to the previous year . <h> The Benefits of eCommerce <p> There is a reason why eCommerce has demonstrated such explosive growth in the past couple of years . Indeed , with the internet becoming an essential requirement of everyday life , businesses are learning to take advantage of the numerous benefits of eCommerce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A physical store will always be limited by a geographical area it can serve . An online store , or any other type of eCommerce business for that matter , has the whole world as its market . Going from a local customer base to a global market at no additional cost is really one of the greatest advantages of trading online . <p> Around-the-clock availability . Another great benefit of running an online business is that it is always open . For a merchant , it 's a dramatic increase in sales opportunities ; for a customer , it 's a convenient and immediately available option . Unrestricted by the working hours , eCommerce businesses can serve customers 24/7/365 . <p> Reduced costs . eCommerce businesses benefit from significantly lower running costs . As there 's no need to hire sales staff or maintain a physical storefront , the major eCommerce costs go to warehousing and product storage . And those running a dropshipping business enjoy even lower upfront investment requirements . As merchants are able to save on operational costs , they can offer better deals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a wealth of customer data and an opportunity to keep an eye on customer buying habits as well as the emerging industry trends , eCommerce businesses can stay agile and shape their marketing efforts to provide a better-tailored experience and find more new customers . Just consider for a moment that you have a chance to address thousands of your customers by their first name ; that is something already . <p> Serving niche markets.Running a niche brick-and-mortar business is extremely difficult . There 's almost no chance of scaling it unless a niche product becomes mainstream . By tapping into a global market , on the other hand , eCommerce retailers can build a highly profitable niche business without any further investment . Using online search capabilities , customers from any corner of the world can find and purchase your products . <p> Working from anywhere .

Although setting up an actual online store would probably take less than a day , researching , building , launching and growing a profitable eCommerce business is a multi-layered process involving a number of steps and decisions . <p> Choosing and sourcing a product.The first step to starting an eCommerce business is deciding what products you 're going to sell . Finding a profitable idea can be hard work , so be prepared to do some serious digging and thinking . It 's essential that you choose products with healthy margins that will allow you to turn a profit and scale the business in the future . Once you know what you want to sell , you 'll need to decide how and where you 're going to source the products . The four main methods of sourcing products and inventory are making , manufacturing , wholesale and dropshipping . <p> Conducting research and planning ahead.Your product idea will dictate which aspects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important areas to look into will be your competition , pricing strategy , and your unique value proposition . At this point , it is also a good idea to draft a business plan that will help you visualize your growth strategy and identify any potential threats or obstacles . <p> Getting your brand right.Now that you have a promising product idea and a clear overview of the market , it 's time to start thinking about the key elements of your store , such as your brand name , domain name , brand guidelines , and your logo . Getting your brand right from the start can help accelerate the growth and conquer the hearts of potential customers . Before turning your attention to building the store , you should spend some time studying the basics of SEO , so that your business gets off to a good start . <p> Deciding how you will sell. - The actual setting up of your online shop can be achieved in two ways : <p> You can build an eCommerce store from scratch this means either developing it yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can take longer and cost more , but building a custom online store will guarantee 100% customization and give you the power to make all the decisions . <p> You can use an off-the-shelf eCommerce solution like Shopify , which makes building an online store a quick and easy process . However , it will also mean less customization , as you will need to choose from an existing pool of themes and tools provided by the platform . If you opt to run a dropshipping business , eCommerce solutions like Oberlo will allow you to get the store off the ground and start selling in as little as few hours . <p> Before launching.At this stage , you 'll be itching to get the store out into the World Wide Web . However , make sure you 're well prepared to measure the success of your launch defining your key performance indicators upfront will help you track your progress and performance and fix any issues as they emerge .

This is where the real work begins . Having launched your online store , you should immediately move on to the promotion phase . Marketing your store and optimizing conversions will be your daily bread and butter from now on . You should also experiment with regularly expanding or refreshing your inventory . It is a particularly easy thing to do for dropshippers , as they can import new dropshipping products in minutes , but it should remain a priority even if you 're manufacturing or making the products yourself .

Be very polite , courteous , and appreciative of them though . You can be nice and still let them know the severity of the situation ( even if you inflate it a bit ) . <p> 3 ) Spam chat support with requests to have the appeal expedited .

If you get the same rep as before just exit out and try again in a few minutes . <p> I 'm not sure if #3 is required ( the spamming part ) , but I did that and then contacted that email I mentioned and had my account reinstated with a reply from that email , so I suspect it was more the email . Still , you should at least have one expedition request in and it ca n't hurt to have more . After that you SHOULD be good to go , but the day after I was cleared of my appeal I was put into appeal AGAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the email above and even got them to verify more cards which is helpful in case I max them out . <p> I would get verified on AliPay ASAP , then place orders with your card , then buy some AliPocket cash to hold onto in case your orders start getting closed .

@@12738269 @1338269/ <p> The 9 to 5 is n't for everyone . If you 've been itching to quit your job and start your own business there 's no better time than now . With dropshipping , you can start your own business at almost no cost . In this article , you 'll learn how to quit your job and start your own business . You 'll also learn what you need to do before your big exit from the 9 to 5 lifestyle . You 'll also be free to use our email resignation template so that you can quit your job without burning any bridges . <h> A sizeable amount of savings <p> Before you quit your job and start your own business , you need to make sure you have some savings for emergencies . This savings account is n't meant to be used to pay your bills . It 's only for emergencies . According to Money Under 30 , you 'll need to save at least six months ' expenses before making your grand exit . Keep in mind , that since this is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for things that are not emergencies . If you 're caught off guard by an expense such as your income tax bill , that 's not an emergency . An emergency would be if your partner loses his job and you get into a car accident that the insurance wo n't cover . Another example of an emergency would be an unexpected surgery that is n't covered by your health care plan . <p> A stream of any kind of income that 's ready on day one <h> Steady stream of income <p> When you quit your job and start a business , you need to make sure you have a stream of income coming in . A stream of income can include a paid part-time job , freelancing gig or even money from a business that 's already making money before your big exit . Your stream of income will be used to pay your bills and invest in your early stage business . Look through your credit card statements . Are there any recurring payments you can cancel ? Can you cut out non-essential expenses . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can save a lot of money by cooking meals at home instead . Focus on cutting out as many expenses as possible . Your stream of income will likely be less than working a stable 9 to 5 . Be clear about the exact amount of money your stream of income needs to bring in each month to keep your finances stable while also having enough left over to invest in advertising for your store . <h> Must be debt free <p> Clear out any debts you have prior to quitting your job to start a business . My first entrepreneurial experience was in 2014 . At the time I had over $20,000 in student loans . Within 6 months , I did n't have enough money to pay my debt and my business had also acquired debt . As I was paying off my student loan , I read financial books like Rich Dad , Poor Dad that helped me better understand money and how it works . In early 2016 , my student loan was finally paid off . If you have a student or car loan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , build your financial acumen through podcasts , youtube videos or books . It 'll make you more strategic with your spending habits so that when you do start a business , you wo n't have to close shop within a few months like I did in 2014 . By paying off debts like student loans , you give yourself more money to play with while also having one less bill to worry about . But do n't dump all your savings into your debt you still need savings . <h> Financial plan in order <p> Having a financial plan in place can be beneficial when starting a business . If you have a mortgage , you need to ensure that you 're still making payments on it . If your first business fails financially , have you taken the steps necessary to ensure you can pick up a 9 to 5 job to recover ? Going back to the 9 to 5 after a failed business is n't giving up . It 's sometimes necessary in order to better prepare for the second business . Another thing to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business loan . While not necessary for a dropshipping business , some may choose to take out a loan or a line of credit in case of an emergency . If you plan on doing this , how much can you afford to pay back with your stream of income in case you burn through the loan with little return . Next , you 'll want to make sure you create a budget with all of your expenses . You 'll also want to make sure you stick to that budget to avoid incurring any additional debts . <h> Are you really motivated ? <p> If you 're seriously thinking about whether or not to quit your job and start your own business , you need to be very motivated . Obsession level motivation . One of the best motivators is anger . Do you passionately hate working a dead-end job ? Are you furious about getting laid off once a year due to seasonal work ? Are you desperate for a change ? Do you hate a lack of freedom and flexibility ? Are you obsessed with a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of needing to escape and make a change , it 'll be hard to maintain energy over the long haul . The day you quit your job write down on a piece of paper all the reasons why you quit . Hold onto it . There will be times when you feel like giving up or forget why you started your business . When that happens , read that piece of paper . Your motivation will get you through the lows and bring you closer to the highs . <h> Experience in the industry you want to work in <p> Having some sort of background in ecommerce , marketing or your niche will go a long way . If you have marketing experience , you 're more likely to succeed as a dropshipper . The most important part of running a store is getting sales and marketers know how to get them with ease . If you have a background in ecommerce , you 'll have an understanding in how to run a store which reduces time spent learning . If you 're an expert in the niche of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of your customers . Also , it 'll make producing content on social media or your blog easier for you . If you do n't have experience with ecommerce , marketing or your niche , it 's best to take some time to learn some more before quitting . When you quit your job to start your own business you want to make sure you have a strong chance of succeeding . This will help prevent you from ever having to return to the 9 to 5 . <h> Proof that what your business will succeed <p> If you 're planning to quit your job to start a business , you need to make sure you have proof of concept . Is your business idea viable ? The only way to answer this question is to start a store while working a 9 to 5 job . It might mean you spend an entire weekend building your store , importing products and creating ads . Once you 've created a successful ad and are seeing sustainable results from it , you have proof . You 'll know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proof that you 've got what it takes to succeed . You 'll never have to worry about second guessing yourself . Set a milestone you want to achieve on your store . Once your store hits that milestone , get ready for your next career chapter . <h> Find a place to work <p> Are you introverted or extroverted ? Where do you work best ? What kind of atmosphere are you most productive in ? These are all questions to consider before quitting your job . For some people , working at home is comfortable . For others , working at home makes them feel trapped . Or maybe you 're not legally allowed to work from home due to zoning laws . You might choose to work in a public library if you 're on a tight budget . You could also choose to work in a coworking space for a couple hundred dollars a month . Coworking spaces are great for extroverted entrepreneurs who need social interaction and want to network with similar minded people . <h> Get a health checkup <p> Once you quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health insurance . Before quitting your job , go get a health checkup . Get a blood test to make sure you 're in great health . If you take prescribed medicine , now 's the time to get a refill before your insurance coverage ends . Do you exercise regularly ? Once you start running your own business you should make sure you keep positive habits . You should still cook your own meals and exercise regularly . Making sure your health is in top notch shape is important . Your business needs you to be in top form . <h> Make sure you have thick skin <p> When you first tell people you want to quit your job and start your own business , you 're going to have people question you . Some people will tell you it 's a bad idea . Others will tell you how lucky you are to have the job you have . Many will tell you that you 're going to fail . You 're going to get a lot of negativity from most of the people in your inner circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people closest to you are often the ones who will try to hold you back the most . You need to be firm in your decision . You need to know with absolute certainty that entrepreneurship is your path . You need to be able to tell the people you love the most that you 're going to do it anyway . When you do n't get immediate results , people will tell you I told you so . Spend less time with the skeptics it 's essential for your sanity . <h> The Wrong Way to Quit Your Job <p> I 've quit my job to pursue entrepreneurial endeavours twice . The first time I did it , I did everything wrong . I did n't have a plan of how I was going to make money . I had thousands of dollars worth of debt . I did n't have any money saved up . <p> I wanted to escape the monotony of the 9 to 5 . I thought I 'd figure it all out along the way . I did n't . Instead , I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and published several mediocre Kindle books . I took them all down eventually because they were really bad , even though they had positive reviews . I launched four Amazon affiliate ecommerce stores . At the same time . I wanted variety . But I 've learned since then that laser focus is best in the beginning . Stick to one niche store at a time . I also did freelancing on Fiverr . Let 's just say $5 gigs do n't pay the bills . <p> There are other things you want to make sure you avoid doing . First , make sure you do n't work on your business while at your current job . During your last few weeks at your job you should actually be putting in your best effort , this is going to be their last impression of you . You 'll have all the time in the world to work on your business when you quit . Second , do n't try to get other people to quit too . Entrepreneurship is your path . It 's bad enough that the company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by trying to get everyone else to quit too . Third , do n't steal company property . No staplers , post-it notes , notebooks or other products you did n't purchase should leave company property . Stealing is still illegal . <h> The Right Way to Quit Your Job <p> When you quit your job and start your own business there are a few key things you should do as you transition . First , make sure you have money saved up . I overemphasized money , debt and finance in the beginning of this article because I know from first hand experience that the lack of it is the biggest business killer . <p> Second , before you quit your job talk to your family about your decision . Having an it 's my life ' attitude can destroy your relationship with your partner or relatives . Cook a delicious meal and talk about why you need to make this transition . Explain to your family why you 'd like them to support your decision . Let them know what your plan is in terms of finances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need to . Try to get their blessing before making any big decisions . Listen to everyone 's perspective . Try to resolve any objections before they become problems . <p> Lastly , when it comes to quitting your job your last couple weeks need to end on good terms . Give at least two weeks notice . If your employer asks for three or more , graciously agree . Besides , you could use the extra money towards your savings . Your final weeks at your job should be spent training the new hire . Give them all of your secrets . Make it impossible for the next hire to fail in the role . Consider it good karma for your transition . The very last thing you should do before you quit is get a reference from someone at the company . You can ask them to leave a positive reference on LinkedIn as well if you plan on being active on it in the future . <h> Email Resignation Template <p> Email Subject : ( Name ) ' s ResignationDear ( Boss ' First Name ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective ( date of two weeks from now ) . I wanted to thank you for all of the opportunities you 've given me during my time at ( Company Name ) .

I have accumulated 1,082 visits , 964 visitors but only 1 sale thus far . <p> I have tried dropping one of the more often viewed product to $24.99 but did n't sell any of it . I was really tempted to drop my all my item prices but my top 5 most viewed products include prices of $28.99 , $39.99 and $63.99 . Moreover , I included a loyalty system for further discounts which none of the visitors responded so I 'm skeptical if price is really the issue . <p> I have spent around $150 USD on advertising by now ( FB+Insta ) . Have tried lookalike audience on my website traffic visitors/audience insights with interest on certain pages/broad interest targeting/different countries . Tried different types of ads including slideshows video/carousel ads/post ads . I messed around a lot with my advertising and been tweaking till I 'm quite lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $0.01 each in one of my campaign and they spend time ( 3+ mins ) on my website too though . <p> My web store is www.intrigs.com Getting many clicks but not converting and feeling really demoralized .. any advice ? Feel free to ask me for info as I 'm unsure what to provide for you guys to assess . Greatly appreciate any responses . <h> brianabbott <p> CollinsXavier It could be the type of clients viewing your products . You need people who buy . Facebook knows who they are , so make sure you choose ' conversions ' as the objective for your ads and exclude Instagram from your audience . There may well be other elements of your ads that need tweaking. <h> luckysump <p> brianabbott I actually think excluding Instagram is a bad idea . I think excluding their network or whatever is better . <p> I personally do Facebook + Instagram and frankly majority of sales come through the Instagram funnel and rarely through the Facebook funnel . <p> CollinsXavier I agree with the others that your design needs a lot of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a new theme would help you a lot . <h> BaileyYordnoff <p> To be honest here , I 'm not a huge fan of the design . Dark background and light text feels very 2005 , and light background/dark text let 's you see the text clearly without anything else distracting your field of vision . <p> That 's the biggest issue here that I can see as a web designer . I ca n't stay on the website for long because of that . Also , the first slide in the slideshow with your company name and slogan is unreadable with that text . <p> Just some tips ... once you get those fixed , the site will feel a lot more reputable ! <h> CollinsXavier <p> Thank you for the feedback ! I was considering switching my template to a white one too . I started off with that dark background as I thought it would make it stand out since clean-white template seems to be the norm nowadays . I guess I 'll change it soon enough ! <h> BaileyYordnoff <p> CollinsXavier Good luck ! I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> CollinsXavier <p> Thanks everyone ! <p> brianabbott I have campaigns optimized for conversions of " Add to Cart " , " Initiate Checkout " and also " Link click " optimized campaigns . I do get several add to carts , in fact I got 8 abandoned carts in the past 24 hours so I 'm really confused what the actual problem is . I could be wrong , but I suspect I 'm not too far off on my targeting ( regarding the type of clients ) . <p> Thanks for the additional support on design rework . I 've changed the first slide on my slideshow as a temporary measure as I 'm working on my product variety ( thinking that could be an issue ) . Hopefully I am able to see a sale or two before I work on the theme again <p> As for Instagram , I am unable to determine if it is good or bad so I ca n't make a decision exclude it . My campaigns that gained " Add to Carts " have placement on both Instagram + Facebook ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the statistics to see whether my Add to Cart customers are from Facebook or Instagram . <p> In my own experience , Instagram seem to have better follows/engagement/link clicks when using single images rather than carousel/video assuming optimized for the same goal . <h> CollinsXavier <h> brianabbott <p> I have a really good PDF , which goes into detail on Facebook advertising . It mentions details which would not have occurred to me and when you see the detail , you can understand why some people may abandon carts if you do n't pick your audience carefully . If you can provide me a way of sending you the PDF , I shall gladly do so . <p> There is also an app for cart abandonments which could recover some lost sales . I ca n't remember the name though . <p> Regards , <p> Brian <h> scshop <p> I like the look and the feel of the site and the photography is great . Menu is a bit too much . You could blend it into the design a bit more . <p> When you reduce the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be consistent with your pricing . Give 20-30% , but not to much . People buy because they want it , not because it 's cheap and when it 's too cheap there must be something wrong with it . <p> Next think about your target market and content marketing . Create a story around Intrigs . Who do you want to be " intrigued " ? Elegant people ? Imaginative people ? Common people ? Give them interesting content . The text about birthstones is interesting , but it 's a little hidden . You can make something like " June birthstone is ... That 's why we give 20% discount to our ... selection " <p> You should decide whether you want to go towards the high end or the low end and make a strategy around that . The site is decent if you ask me. <h> luckysump <p> Menu 's a little tough to find IMO . <p> I used this free theme when I was getting started and have since moved onto a paid one . I actually suggest trying a paid one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same free theme , things get a little dicey in the trust category . <p> Your compared at prices are interesting . People know that cheap jewelery , is , well , cheap . So marketing it at $69 with the price slash to $18.99 seems a little weird IMO . <p> I 'd suggest doing a 2.2x multiplier with a 2.6x or even as high as 2.8x compared at price . <p> Fix the spelling error on your catalog page ... <p> Women 's Rings , Men 's Ring = me nitpicking but I think either pluralize both or remove the s on the Women 's Rings 
@@12738274 @1338274/ <h> Duplicating Products <h> MattMingin <p> Hi , I 'm currently in the process of setting up all the products in my store and I 'm just trying to figure out the most efficient way of going forward . <p> I list all my products as retail prices on my website , however I also run a FREE + SHIPPING duplicate of each product which are only accessible via my FB ad campaigns . So basically I have two versions of the same product ( including all variants ) where the only real difference is the listed price . <p> Is it possible to import an item , tidy up all the images and content , then duplicate the item within Shopify - will Oberlo recognise this duplicate ? <p> Currently , by doing the import twice through Oberlo , I basically have to redo ALL the details for ALL the variants TWICE , which can be super tedious when 20+ variants are listed ( and especially when I 'm customising the images to keep things tidier etc . ) . <p> I 've also tried duplicating the finalised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue is ALL of the variants get replaced by the non-polished stock variants , so I end up having to go back in and manually edit them back . This is probably a quicker method than the previous mentioned however still requires much double handling . <p> If either of these are the only way to go then so be it , but I 'd rather ask now before wasting hours only to find out there was a quicker way ! And if so , can you PLEASE look into a way of linking ( overriding ) existing products WITHOUT the existing details being replaced - just some sort of behind the scene code/ID link ? ? <h> MattMingin <p> Thanks for the reply . That 's OK , at least I know what to do going forward ! <p> I know nothing about programming and I 'm sure you 've thought about these possibilities but I 'll shoot some thoughts I have anyway : <p> Within Oberlo app , under ' My Products ' then under ' Action ' - if you could create a ' Duplicate ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then push the duplicate to Shopify , we 'd be set . <p> When Overriding an existing item from Oberlo , there 's the option to leave the existing product heading , description , images etc. - is it not possible to apply this same method to the Variant images , descriptions etc ? I 'm assuming Oberlo has to track each variant with some behind the scenes I 'd , so I do n't see the need to override all the front end info too ? <p> Anyway , keep up the great work . We all appreciate the app and your customer support ! <h> JGK <p> Ok I am not sure of the nuance here but I am essentially doing the same thing as MattMingin on a few of my items as loss leaders . However all I did was to import with Oberlo and then duplicate within Shopify . I am not sure what the override is or does .... I am wondering if this will affect ordering somehow ? Can you elucidate ? <h> JGK <p> Tomas , I did n't wait for your response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted the products ( free plus shipping ) that were n't showing up in the Oberlo My products tab ( ) becasue I had duplicated them in Shopify . I imported again and set them up as the Free offers These products now show up under my products with the Oberlo app . <p> From what you say I should have imported them BUT used the override ... but I think that would have made sense IF the original free + shipping products were showing in the app but they were n't . So there was nothing to override . <p> Going forward I think I 'll just have to import products twice .. unless you add functionality to the app . <p> Make sense to you ? @qwx196609 <p> It does . You could have done this both ways " after you import a product again , you can either publish it to your store or use the override feature to replace your existing product with it . <h> JGK <p> Tomas Actually I could not have done it both ways . <p> I needed to override the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shopify but when I chose the override option those products were not shown -Oberlo did n't recognize them . So my only option was to re-import . A pain as you then have to rework the listing title/description etc . <p> I know you have no control over Shopify 's duplicate function but maybe ( somehow ! ) you can add coding to the original product so that duplicating a product also duplicates the Oberlo vendor links . Sounds simple but probably is n't ! <h> simbabox <p> Hi Tomas , I have filled my shop with products from Aliexpress , but later on , I have realized that I have so many duplicated products on my store , my question is there an easy way to delete those duplicates and how to avoid adding them in the future ?

@@12738279 @1338279/ <h> What is Profit Margin ? <p> Profit margin refers to the percentage of total revenue that remains after all costs , taxes and other expenses have been deducted . You can think of profit margin as a way to assess how much profit your company is making on every dollar of sales . <h> How is Profit Margin calculated ? <p> Profit margin can be calculated using a simple formula : <p> Profit Margin = ( Total Sales Total Expenses ) / Total Sales - <p> Here is a simple example of how it works : <p> Let us assume that your company made $500k in sales last year . After you have deducted all of your costs and expenses , such as rent , salaries , cost of goods , etc. , you 're left with net profits of $100k .

@@12738283 @1338283/ <h> What is conversion rate optimization ? <p> Conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who take your desired action on the page , whether that 's completing a registration form , downloading an ebook , or making a purchase . <p> Conversion rate optimization ( CRO ) is a data-driven process for increasing the percentage of visitors who take a specific action and convert . The conversion rate optimization- is calculated by dividing the number of people who convert by the number of people who are asked to take an action . <h> Why is conversion rate optimization important ? <p> Essentially , there are two ways to grow an online business : drive more traffic to a website in hopes to increase sales or improve the conversion rate and turn the current traffic into paying customers . Running rigorous experiments on your website and leveraging that data to improve conversions is a much cheaper and more effective strategy that will continue to generate sales in the future . Optimizing your conversion rate also means you cut down on the cost of acquiring new users significantly , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your marketing spend . <p> In eCommerce in particular , conversions happen at every stage of a customer 's buying journey , as they are dependent on the purpose that a certain part of a website serves . For example , a customer clicking through a product image is a conversion because it nudges him down the funnel and closer to making a purchase . By removing friction and making the conversion paths shorter and smoother , you 're creating more sales opportunities and accelerating the sales process . <p> To maximize the value of the traffic you already have , you need to engage in constant testing , experimentation and active listening and fine-tune every aspect of your eCommerce website for higher conversions . <h> How to optimize conversion rate ? <p> Conversion rate optimization is a long process of meticulous experimentation often executed through A/B testing . The first step before you start testing anything is to examine your website 's sales funnel and identify friction points that could be improved in order to achieve higher conversions . The best way to gather this type of data is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports to see how people are moving through your site as well as identify where they drop off . Hotjar , which utilizes heatmaps and records user actions on site , is another great tool for data gathering . <p> Having crunched the data and determined potential conversion issues , you then move on to deciding what aspects of your website you want to run experiments on . This will depend on the conversion goal you 're optimizing for . In Google Analytics , goals are used to measure how visitors complete a certain task and navigate a website . An example of a goal could be a newsletter subscription , direct enquiry , a booking or a purchase . It all boils down to the metrics that are important to your business and the ideal conversion path you mapped out for your visitors from the entry point to the final conversion . <p> Website conversions . By identifying specific elements that you want to test ( CTA , page colours , layout , copy , etc ) , the target audience ( organic traffic , existing customers , leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( homepage , product page , landing page , etc ) , you 'll be able to formulate a hypothesis and create an objective for each experiment . Once all this is done , you can move on to A/B testing . Optimizely and vwo are some of the best A/B testing tools you can try . <p> To improve the conversion rates of your eCommerce store , you 'll need to analyze the test results and make changes based on the answers you get . <p> Conversion rate optimization- in general . The beauty of conversion rate optimization- is that it focuses on doing a better job at turning existing visitors into paying customers , rather than trying to acquire new visitors . As the process of converting existing visitors is more cost-effective than throwing more money at driving traffic to your site , conversion rate optimization- allows you to get the most out of your current investments by redirecting your budget to channels that achieve the best results . <p> What this means is that you should be spending time optimizing all channels ( email , paid search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure you 're targeting the right people with the right messaging , so when they land on your site , the probability of them bouncing as a result of misleading offers or unmet expectations is very low . Different channels call for different optimization techniques , however , A/B testing is the thread that runs through them all . You can test everything from newsletter subject lines to Facebook ad copy to AdWords CTA . <p> With new customer behavior insights and optimization tactics emerging every day , conversion rate optimization is never completely finished it 's a continuous , ongoing process that you should adopt and carry out often . @qwx196605 @qwx196610

@@12738285 @1338285/ <p> Over the past seven years I 've launched six online stores , and during this time I 've learnt a lot about ecommerce businesses . If you 're thinking about starting your own ecommerce business , I have some advice for you : knowledge is power . The more that you know about running your own ecommerce business , the more likely that you are to succeed . I 've created this article to help those of you who are thinking about starting your own online store avoid some of the common pitfalls which ecommerce entrepreneurs encounter . <h> Marketing is Essential <p> Marketing is one of the core aspects of any business . It 's also one of the easiest things to overlook . There are plenty of ecommerce businesses which have great products and a beautiful website but ultimately fail because they ca n't attract people to their store . If nobody is visiting your store , then how can you expect to make any sales ? <p> Choosing The Right Marketing Campaigns <p> It 's essential that you devise marketing campaigns which will generate traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various different channels which you can use to grow your store like PPC or email marketing . I 'd recommend that you choose a marketing channel with a quick feedback loop when you 're just starting your ecommerce business . <p> Marketing Channels With A Quick Feedback Loop <p> Whilst marketing techniques like SEO are valuable to your ecommerce business in the long run , it 's essential that you can get your ecommerce business off the ground quickly . For this reason I would recommend that you do n't focus on marketing channels like SEO it could take several weeks to yield results . Instead I 'd focus on channels like PPC marketing , where you 'll be able to see how successful your campaigns are within a few days . Not only will you be able to track your results quickly , you 'll also gain insights on what you need to improve within a short amount of time . <p> Pick The Right Audience <p> To ensure that your marketing campaigns are successful , you 'll need to target your message to the right people . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , but you 'll likely have a pretty solid idea from the products which you 're selling . <p> I 've found that it 's best to start quite broadly with your marketing campaigns until you have a better understanding of who your audience are . When you 've gained more knowledge about your audience you can refine your campaigns to be more effective for your specific audience . <h> Customer Service Is King <p> Look after your customers and they 'll look after you . <p> When you provide a high level of customer service you 're setting your business up for success . Being fair and sincere with your customers will leave a lasting impression on them , and they 'll be more inclined to buy from your store again . <p> Not all ecommerce entrepreneurs provide great customer service , but it 's critical that you take as much pride in the way you treat your customers as you do with the way you handle your business . <p> Personalize Everything <p> Personalizing your customer service interactions will make your customers feel valued , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store again . <p> Templated replies are fine in small amounts as they 'll save you valuable time , but your customers will notice when you make the extra effort to personalize your interactions . When you tailor your responses to your customer 's issue they 'll know that you care about them , and that you 're working to solve their issue . <p> Be Open <p> Mistakes happen , and it 's important that both you and your customers are aware of this . <p> I 've found that it 's always best to be transparent with your customers if you 've made a mistake . Being open and honest with your customers let 's them know that you 're a genuine business person . Whilst I was running my ecommerce businesses I always found that customers were understanding and appreciative when you keep them informed of any issues regarding their orders . <p> Lost / Late Deliveries <p> Thankfully , the rate of packages which are lost in transit is low . The main issue which you 'll encounter when shipping your products to customers is late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery could arrive later than expected , but it does n't matter to the customer , they just want to receive their order . I 've found that the best way to reconcile for late deliveries is to always keep your customers in the loop they 'll feel appreciative that you 've reached out to them instead of angry that their delivery is late . <h> Fraud Is Rare For Ecommerce Businesses <p> You 'll rarely encounter fraudulent activity whilst you 're running your ecommerce business . Whilst I was running my last ecommerce business I only came across one or two cases of fraud in around 60,000 orders per year . In fact , the global average rate of fraud is only 0.8% , which means that you 'll encounter it less than once in every 100 orders . Even if your ecommerce store has made 1000 orders you 'll still only encounter it 8 times on average , so it 's only a minor problem . <p> Fraud rates are so low because popular ecommerce gateways do a lot to detect and prevent fraud before it can even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run your store , like Shopify , then you 'll find that they 've implemented fraud detection systems at the checkout stage . This means that potentially fraudulent activity , like if a user has input an incorrect billing address , will be flagged and the order wo n't be completed . You 'll also have a secondary layer of protection from your payment gateways , like Paypal , who run their own fraud detection systems . <h> Pick Your Products Wisely <p> Ecommerce businesses thrive when you 've found high-quality products which you 're selling at an affordable price . You 'll need to decide on the types of products which you 're going to be selling before you start , and where you 'll be sourcing them from . <p> Deciding Which Products To Sell <p> This is one of the most frequently asked questions from ecommerce entrepreneurs . Take some time to brainstorm some of your ideas and decide on some products which you believe are solid options for your ecommerce store . Then you 'll need to check out potential competitors and see if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a market for your products . Think about what you can do to make your product inventory better than theirs . <p> Sourcing Your Products <p> Ecommerce entrepreneurs can source products from all over the world with relative ease . Before you start your ecommerce business you should decide which countries make the most sense for you to source your products from . If you 're going to source products from China then you 'll find that they 're relatively cheap , but the delivery time may take a little while . On the other hand , if you 're sourcing products from the USA they 'll arrive faster but the price tag will also be higher . <p> Managing Your Inventory <p> This is one of the most important tasks for ecommerce businesses . Whilst your store is getting off the ground you 'll likely be able to store your products at your home , but as your store grows you 'll need to hold much more inventory . Eventually you 'll need to spend resources on a place to hold your inventory , or come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers . Choosing a dropshipping business model will mean that you 'll be able to ship your products straight from the supplier to your customers you 'll never have to store any inventory . <p> Focus Your Inventory <p> Whilst you 're compiling your store 's inventory it 's critical that you keep your target audience in mind . Every product which you add to your store needs to be something which is appealing to your target audience . <p> If you want to branch out later in your ecommerce journey then it 's best to do it gradually . Switching your core products from men 's golf shoes to men 's golf hats is going to be far easier than switching to selling women 's clothing . If you decide to branch out then make sure that you know your new target audience and which products they are interested in . <h> Shipping Your Products <p> I 've sold and shipped products all over the world and I 've learnt that it 's paramount that you 're clear with your expected shipping times . It 's also important that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll receive their products . Your customers are aware that you 're running an international , so they 'll understand that their products might take a little longer to arrive . <h> Test , Analyze , Learn <p> When you 're starting your ecommerce business it 's critical that you find out what works for you as soon as possible . I 've found that the best way to do this is to start multiple ecommerce stores at once .

@@12738286 @1338286/ <h> What is an attribution model ? <p> An attribution model is a practice that determines how credit for sales and conversions is assigned to different channels across different touchpoints in the buyer journey . It 's the process of connecting various campaigns to a company 's ROI . <h> Types of attribution models <p> Different attribution models are used in different situations . Let 's look at an attribution modeling example : <p> #1 touchpoint:A new customer lands on your website by clicking through one of your Google ads but does n't buy anything . <p> #2 touchpoint : Three days later , she returns to the website by clicking on one of your Facebook posts but , again , does n't buy anything . <p> #3 touchpoint : The following day she receives one of your email marketing campaigns and returns to the site for the third time , no purchase yet . <p> #4 touchpoint : That same day , a few hours later , she returns to your website directly and makes a purchase . <p> Which channel should get the credit for this conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're using . <p> #1 The First Interaction attribution model <p> According to this model , the first touch in the customer journey in the case of the example above , the Paid Search channel , should receive 100% of the credit for the conversion . <p> #2 The Last Interaction attribution model <p> The Last touch attribution model is the simplest one to measure as it gives 100% of the credit for the sale to the last touchpoint in the customer journey . In this case , it would be the Direct channel . <p> #3 The Last Non-Direct Click attribution model <p> The Last Non-Direct Click attribution model ignores all direct traffic and attributes 100% of the credit for the conversion to the last channel that drove the customer to the website ( in our example , the Email channel ) . <p> #4 The Last AdWords Click attribution model <p> The Last AdWords Click attribution model awards 100% of the credit for the sale to the last AdWords click ( in our example that 's the first and the only click from the Paid Search channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also important to pay attention to the conversion window that you set up on your AdWords account . Conversion window is the period of time after a click on your ad during which a conversion ( such as a purchase ) occurs . By default , the conversion window is set to be 30 days but you can adjust it to any period of time depending on your needs . In terms of attribution models , keep in mind that the Last AdWords Click attribution report will show only those conversions that happen within the conversion window you chose . <p> #5 The Linear attribution model <p> The Linear attribution model would give equal credit for the sale to each touchpoint in the conversion path ( in this case , 25% credit to Paid Search , Social Network , Email and Direct channels ) . <p> #6 The Time Decay attribution model <p> The Time Decay attribution model regards the touchpoints closest in time to the conversion as the most important and gives them the most credit . In our example , Direct and Email channels would get most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before making a purchase . The least credit would be attributed to the first touchpoint , the Paid Search channel because it is the farthest away from the conversion . <p> #7 The Position Based attribution model <p> In the Position Based model , the first and last interactions receive 40% of the credit each and the remainder is distributed evenly to all middle interactions . In our example , the Paid Search and Direct channels would be given 40% of the credit each , and the remaining 20% would go to Social Network ( 10% ) and Email ( 10% ) . <h> Why is attribution model important ? <p> The right attribution model can tell you how much each channel contributes to your business objectives , such as profits , revenue , new business , and customer retention . By understanding which channels are driving the most impact across the different touchpoints of the sales funnel , you can better allocate advertising budget and invest in channels that have a higher conversion rate . @qwx196605 @qwx196610

@@12738289 @1338289/ <p> There are so many amazing startup founders who have built successful businesses . Some have succeeded via dropshipping , a business model which involves shipping products straight from the supplier to the customer , while others have succeeded by creating- their own products . Some have sold via their own online stores others used marketplaces like Amazon and Etsy . No matter where they started , or how they 've built their first successful business , they 've all managed to make over $50,000+ a year. - These inspiring stories from startup founders will make you realize that anything is possible in business . <p> One Tribe Apparel <p> Ryan O'Connor is the startup founder of One Tribe Apparel . His company sells harem pants , boho handbags , and more . Their store features several great features such as a lookbook , shoppable Instagram feed , and some awesome product photos . <p> What 's been your biggest accomplishment with your online store ? Ryan : We recently launched an international lookbook featuring women from 16 different countries , all of whom we connected with through our Instagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborations from it and overall it 's just a nice showcase of our brand mission and a reflection of our ethos at One Tribe Apparel.Which mistake did you learn the most from ? Ryan : We hired someone to do AdWords PPC and they just wasted thousands of dollars of our money . It made me realize that I need to learn more about each marketing channel before I outsource it . You need to be able to outsource to scale but you also need to be competent in the main channels of your business . In the end no one is going to care about your business nearly as much as you are . <p> Which strategy or tactic has been your biggest money maker ? Ryan : SEO accounts for 40% or more of our sales . It 's my background . I used to work at an agency and then moved on to freelance consulting . SEO is a long term investment , but the great thing about it is that once the traffic is coming in it 's sustainable and does n't cost you money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to someone starting out ? Ryan : In 2017 I would actually say for most first time e-commerce &amp; physical product entrepreneurs that they may not want to dive right into Shopify . I had someone reach out to me recently wanting to start a streetwear fashion brand and they said they had a $1,000 budget to get their first product made , build the site , photos , etc . <p> That 's just not enough money to get things going properly so my advice to them was to take that money and buy a decent camera or a GoPro and build up their social accounts . If they are passionate about street wear they can build a following doing one off custom pieces , recommending other brands , and most importantly showcasing the lifestyle . If they grow the accounts well enough they will start to get offers from brands who are giving them free clothes and paying them to post . We work with a lot of Instagram influencers and it seems like a pretty good deal . Many of them are getting $200 or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a product . <p> The other thing is that once you build your following and you eventually launch a store/brand you 'll already have a captive audience that trusts you and getting those initial sales will be much easier.A 2nd alternative would be to prove the concept of your product on Amazon or Etsy and make sure it sells , work out the kinks , etc. before launching your Shopify store . <h> Hagwood Soap Co <p> Chris Hagler - is the startup founder of Hagwood Soap Co . His store sells soap , balms , shampoo , and other healthcare products . His store features a giveaway section , offers conditional free shipping on orders over $75 , and even allows people to wholesale his products . <p> What 's been your biggest accomplishment with any of your online stores ? <p> Chris : My biggest accomplishment was to turn something I was into creating as a hobby , into something that provides value to people . To me , providing value is the key in any business . Reading numerous emails and Instagram messages daily about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push harder everyday . <p> Which mistake did you learn the most from ? <p> Chris : My biggest mistake and lesson I have learned is that a very vocal , unhappy customer can be turned into a very vocal HAPPY customer more than 90% of the time . Never ignore your customers and always treat them with respect . Remember , they are going out of their way to buy something from YOU rather than thousands of others , how cool is that ! <p> What strategy or tactic has been your biggest money maker ? <p> Chris : My best strategy for making the most money is to just be myself and to stick to what my company stands for . Do n't  copy anyone else , keep your head down , and keep grinding day in and day out . Show your face , do n't  be afraid to do live videos , do n't  be afraid to mess up . People buy from people who they can relate to . <p> Chris : I 'd say the biggest piece of advice I could give is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to start a business and be able to quit your job in 5 years and " live the dream " , but also be aggressive in the sense that you want to get there at all costs . You have to be the tortoise IN the hare 's costume . Also , do n't  worry about what everyone else has and how far every other company is , focus on you and then watch the people come to you . Do n't  try to please everyone and stay true to what your brand stands for and the customers will relate and find you .

Figuring out the threshold at which customers will continue to buy despite paying for shipping has been really important . We " lost " a fair amount of margin last fall offering free shipping on everything without increasing prices enough to cover the cost . Weve since found that free shipping over $150 drives as much traffic as free shipping on everything . <p> What strategy or tactic has been your biggest money maker ? <p> Darin : A big money making strategy has been to do pre-orders on upcoming styles .

However a lot of my goals are based around specific numbers and dates . I set 3 month and 12 month goals . My goal for this year is to do $500,000k in profit , which will mean doing about 1.5 to 2 million in sales . <p> Which mistake did you learn the most from ? <p> Jovan : Have back-ups of everything . Back up stores , back up suppliers , back up credit cards , back up product sourcing , back-up advertising accounts everything . Depending on how your business is set up it can be a very fragile , linear chain , and if anything happens to even one of those links , your sales can go from $10K yesterday to ZERO today . So when you start doing sales , make sure to cover your grounds . <p> What strategy or tactic has been your biggest money maker ? <p> Jovan : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to- find a scalable advertising method . For me it was Facebook advertising , but you might find more luck with Google ads , YouTube video ads , Instagram influencers , and so on . <p> The way Facebook works is if you 're spending $5/day on ads and you earn $10 profit , then in theory if you spend $5000/day you would earn $10,000 in profit . And these are just impulse purchases , not taking into account the lifetime value of the customer . <p> That 's what makes Facebook so powerful and is why I was able to go from literally $0 to $50,000 in the first 10 days of opening up my new store . But I also want to say before that I had MONTHS of no success until I got the hang of it . FB ads are very complicated and will be an extreme learning curve . @qwx196608 @qwx196607 @qwx196611

@@12738292 @1338292/ <h> What is Manufacturing ? <p> Manufacturing refers to a large-scale production of goods that converts raw materials , parts and components into finished merchandise using manual labour and/or machines .

However , in this post , we 'll answer the question of what is content marketing , why it 's a good idea and how to get started . Let 's not waste too much time and get started answering the vital question you are here for , what is content marketing ? <h> What is content marketing ? <p> If you 've never heard of this term before it can be hard to decode it . Content marketing means creating and distributing- free information related to your business and industry . This can be text content like blogs or ebooks . You can also provide videos , infographics or audio content like podcasts . You 'll share the content to drive traffic and ultimately business for your company . <p> The only way content marketing will work if you provide valuable information . Click baits can be easily spotted . Poor and cheap content will not generate enough interest for potential customers to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog to have their own platform of content . There are many advantages of keeping the content on your own website . <h> Start with a blog for SEO boost <p> The biggest one is SEO . Having relevant content on your website gives you a lot of SEO juice . You will naturally end up ranking for a wide range of relevant keywords . Additionally , the more pages Google indexes for you , the better . Each blog post is one more page that could show up in a customer 's search . Google also loves content that is regularly updated . Even posting something once a week is enough . Google rewards websites with regular updates because it means the website is active . Same goes for customers people enjoy returning to websites that regularly publish new things . <h> Blogs help build your audience <p> Your blog should serve as a community for like-minded people . You may not be interacting with them directly but they will keep returning for quality content . Some companies post useless thing on their blogs like product announcement and sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at this blog post , we 're not trying to sell you on Oberlo .

Instead of making your head spin as to what to post next on Facebook or Twitter , you can share links to your blog posts instead . Use your content to keep your social media alive ! It 's a great benefit of creating your own stuff and that is what makes content marketing a great investment . Consider your blog a repository of great content . The more you create the more you 'll have to share . And do n't be scared of sharing older posts . They are still good even if it 's a few weeks or months old . <p> To circle back to SEO quickly , social media links are fantastic for SEO juice too . The more links there are to your content the better . Another reason having your own blog is helpful is that others can share it . I , as your customer , can share it to my followers and when someone clicks they are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media really .

Some of their posts include what to wear to bed , tips on the currently trending hairstyle , and how to tie a scarf . Mr. Porter is a good example for drop shipping companies selling apparel . It 's a great example of what is content marketing , making the site a fantastic role model to learn from . You will quickly get an idea of the type of content you could produce too .

So , when you are starting out keep things as relevant as you can . Expand you blog into other areas one you are an establish company . Otherwise , these topics could be highly relevant and hurt you rather than help you . <h> Content marketing in different social medias <p> Once you get comfortable with you blog try expanding your content marketing towards different social media outlets .

I 'm constantly looking for new tools to use that either save me time or make me money . I 've recently been looking into Doba.com as many Oberlo users have asked us to explain the difference between the two platforms . In this Doba.com review , I will detail how it works , pros and cons , what real customers think of it and more . <h> What is Dropshipping ? <p> Dropshipping is when a retailer does n't carry inventory of product but rather uses a manufacturer to hold inventory and ship directly to the customer on the retailer 's behalf . <p> Dropshipping appeals mostly to two types of entrepreneurs : new and risk averse . New entrepreneurs dropship products as they may not have experience running an online store but may have strengths in marketing that allow them to experience and succeed in entrepreneurship . Risk averse entrepreneurs also prefer dropshipping as they are n't required to buy products in bulk , hold inventory or meet minimum sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows great potential for big profit . <p> When comparing dropshipping to wholesale , dropshipping tends to be more favorable .

A dropshipper might be slightly more expensive ( but not by much ) when compared to wholesaling but the benefits of reduced workload while minimizing risk makes it a better alternative . <h> What is Doba ? <p> Doba.com is an American dropshipping platform that connects entrepreneurs or retailers to products they can sell .

With the new suppliers , you might not be familiar with their quality but it allows you to test it out to see if they 're worth continuing with . With their supplier listings , you can choose brand names you know and trust or check to see if a supplier you use has added any new products to add to your store . <p> Managing Your Inventory <p> When you first create a store during your trial period , you 'll find that there are already 20 items pre-loaded into your Inventory .

For example , if your store is a clothing store for women , you might not only sell fashion items . You could also sell jewelry , shoes and handbags as it 's still relevant to your audience . You need to make sure that you keep your ideal customer in mind when selecting items for your inventory . <p> Exporting to Your Store <p> Once you have chosen your inventory you can export product information into an XML spreadsheet or other format . The final spreadsheet will detail valuable information such as the dropship fee , supplier , product name , product description and more . <p> Managing Orders <p> As orders come in through your website , you can manage them in Doba . You can place orders and make payments on their platform . Under status , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pending payment , shipping pending , have been shipped , and more . <h> Doba.com Review Pros <p> Has a large selection of products Doba has over 2 million products to choose from in a range of categories such as Apparel , Automotive , Books , Entertainment and more . They feature products from recognizable brands such as Leap Frog and household names such as Harper Lee . <p> Easily export to Amazon and Ebay Doba allows you to export your product inventory to websites such as Amazon and Ebay which are popular among dropshippers . <p> Free trial According to reviews online , Doba previously offered a 7 day trial and required a credit card . Fortunately , they now offer a 30 day trial and do not require a credit card during the trial period . This allows customers to test out their platform safely without the risk of getting charged . <h> Doba.com Review - Cons <p> Cost of goods There are a few significant problems with the cost of goods on Doba . For example , the product pricing is n't competitive . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doba for $30 ( price dropshippers pay ) with a suggested retail price of $58 ( what customers pay ) . Yet , when you go to Amazon , the listing price is $13.33 for retail . Despite their size difference , most would likely buy the rug on Amazon for its affordable pricing . <p> Also , many of their trending products are in the high-end range ( $80+ ) though they have a couple of items featured under $10 . As a dropshipper , you 'll want to ensure you have enough variety in product prices so that you can ensure you have products that appeal to your ideal market . However , choosing only expensive products makes marketing more difficult as it does n't appeal to a great majority . It 's harder to find customers who will buy high end products that you can find affordably with ease . <p> Cost of Doba Doba is one of the most expensive dropshipping platforms . It offers customers four plans : Basic ( $29 ) , Advanced ( $69 ) , Pro ( $249 ) and Enterprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular plan , is strange . It only offers three additional features , one of them being Live Chat Support . ' Oberlo does n't charge premiums for better customer service . <p> Lack of product reviews An important part of product selection is reading reviews and seeing star ratings . None of the products on Doba show a rating which makes it difficult to gauge whether a product will actually perform well or not . For example , the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rug above has a 3 star rating on Amazon despite being a well known brand . <p> Low Margins Doba 's pricing is high for a dropshipping model . Dropshippers are typically the middle man between manufacturing and the customer . However , Doba 's pricing is n't competitive for those who dropship . For example , Oberlo allows retailers to use AliExpress as a supplier . Here are two price examples of similar products on AliExpress and Doba : On AliExpress via Oberlo , a gold toned scooter costs $218.99 . On Doba , dropshippers are charged $295 for a similar product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its affordable pricing . <p> Membership Cancellation According to Doba reviews online , many customers have struggled to cancel their memberships . The only way for a dropshipper with a Basic plan to get in touch with support to cancel - is via email . Unfortunately , there are often delays in waiting for a customer support member to respond to an email . A customer would have to have the Advanced Plan to be able to cancel via live chat which would be much faster . <p> Product Inventory Low Many of the products on the Doba website only have an inventory level of under 100 items . That number may seem high to an untrained eye . However , anyone who has ever run a successful dropshipping store knows that an ad promoting one product can sell hundreds of the same item in a matter of days . It 'd be pretty frustrating to run out of product quickly when you 've finally created a successful campaign . Also , think about how many other dropshippers are potentially selling the same item . It 's possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already out of inventory . <p> Hard to Navigate Doba 's website lacks a modern interface and has a challenging navigation . Some aspects like searching through products is simple but when it comes to the getting it onto your store , it becomes much more complicated . <p> Negative Doba Reviews There are a lot of negative reviews online about Doba . If you look at Doba 's Better Business Bureau rating it has only 26 reviews : 16 positive , 1 neutral , and 9 negative . The 16 positive reviews seems promising until you do a bit of digging . The business had been accredited on BBB since 2003 but all of the reviews have been written in the past two years . What 's even more concerning is that in 2015 all their reviews were either negative or neutral . <p> Customer Support Getting in touch with a customer support representative should be easy . Unfortunately , the only way for someone to get in touch with their team is via email . A phone number is n't listed on their website . Live chat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't accessible enough . <h> Doba Vs Oberlo Review <p> While Doba and Oberlo are both in the dropshipping space , they both differ from each other greatly . Here 's why : <p> Products : Doba uses branded products while Oberlo uses AliExpress products . At first glance , branded products seem appealing . There are a few problems with that though . First , margins on branded products are almost always smaller . Brands will always make more money off the products they create than the person selling them . Second , you can never make it look like they 're your products . For example , if people know they 're buying a name brand product , they know where else they can look to find it . If they do n't know the brand name , then they 'll usually assume they can only buy it from that retailer 's website . With Oberlo , you have access to millions of AliExpress products that allow you to make a profit while also being able to build your own brand . AliExpress suppliers also stay on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timely products to their customers . <p> Margins : As mentioned above , margins on Doba are tighter than on Oberlo . Using the scooter example above you can see that Doba 's pricing is pretty much on par with retail pricing , making it next to impossible to generate a substantial profit . With Oberlo , the product price is so low that you can generate a profit from products , even if you sell it at the same price as Amazon , the most competitive ecommerce store . <p> Start now : With Oberlo , you can start your store immediately for free . You can quickly import products into your store in a matter of minutes . Within minutes of importing products , you can create ads and promote your products the same day . There 's no need to contact suppliers . <p> Business Entity : With Oberlo , you do n't need to officially own a business in the beginning . Eventually , when you start achieving success you 'll be required to register a business for tax/legal purposes . However , Oberlo gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoy running a business . With Doba , upon registration you 're asked about your business entity . <p> User Friendliness : Oberlo is so easy to use even someone without a business or technical background can set up their first store with ease . Oberlo provides resources , a free eCommerce ebook , tutorials and easy to follow steps to ensure anyone of any level can do it . Doba provides tutorials as well , however , their layout and website can be confusing at times . <h> Doba.com Dropshipping Review Is it worth it ? <p> At first glance , Doba offers a wide selection of branded products . The product brand recognition alone can draw in a dropshipper in quickly . However , their high prices is likely going to make your dropshipping business short-lived . It 's a competitive marketplace out there . In order to create a sustainable , long-term thriving business , a retailer needs to have access to affordable products with margins that 'll allow them to market their business , cover necessary business expenses and make a profit . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to create low-cost ads in order to make any real profit off their product . They 'd also need to promote their products on their own website as they would n't be able to offer competitive pricing even if they wanted to despite a big angle of how dropshippers can sell on Ebay and Amazon . <p> This Doba review shows that Doba - may not be worth pursuing but that does n't mean you should rule out dropshipping altogether . <h> Best Doba Alternative <p> Oberlo is the best alternative to Doba . Here 's why : <p> Easy to Succeed : When comparing Oberlo success stories to Doba , Oberlo 's customers are succeeding by a landslide . Many Oberlo users have been able to hit 6 or 7 figures with their stores in a matter of months . The low product cost makes a huge difference in allowing people to make a profit . <p> Easy to Choose Products : It 's hard to know whether or not a product will sell no matter how experienced you are . With Oberlo , you can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order volume . All of this information allows you to be an intelligent and successful entrepreneur . <p> Affordable Pricing : Oberlo 's monthly plans start at around $5 . This makes the risk ultra low . The only reason why we offer a plan this affordable is because we know that your store can make much more than that . We want you to be extremely profitable in your first few months so that you can re-invest in your business and take it to the next level . <p> Positive Feedback : In the Shopify App store , Oberlo is the highest rated app in the Inventory section . It also has the most reviews . Oberlo focuses on providing customers a great product , a great experience and great customer support . Customers love how easy it is to use , the affordable pricing , how efficient it has made their business , and more . <p> When it comes to creating a dropshipping store Oberlo is definitely worth exploring . @qwx196608 @qwx196607 @qwx196611 <p> robert jr <p> the first example with that turtle rug is wrong .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30$ Aliexpress offered it 19 ? x 29 ? sized rug 13$ So Yes there is difference in price , because much dif . in size , and probably in quality too . Oberlo ! instead of ruining Doba services , please try to improve yours , because that is more attracting for costumers .. 
@@12738302 @1338302/ <p> Oberlo just celebrated its first year anniversary . We 've achieved some great things together , and great success is naturally followed by fierce competition . <p> We 've long held the position of not making comparisons . We honestly focus 100% of our attention on our customers . But after receiving several complaints about the ShopifiedApp , we had to make an exception . <p> This article compares Oberlo and ShopifiedApp in terms of the following aspects : <h> Product Sources " What products can I import ? <p> Oberlo and ShopifiedApp both use AliExpress as their primary source of products . <p> It 's not a coincidence that AliExpress has become the most popular dropshipped products sourcing solution : <p> AliExpress has a massive products catalogue . You can find anything on AliExpress . <p> AliExpress suppliers quickly react to market trends . When you 're dropshipping , you look for products that will sell . It means they 're fashionable and up to date . <p> AliExpress prices are ridiculously low and suppliers do n't have any MSRP " this means bigger profits for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure for dropshipping . Most of the suppliers are dropshipping outside of AliExpress anyway . That 's extremely important <p> AliExpress is the only marketplace suitable for dropshipping . ShopifiedApp and other apps might offer other product sources like Walmart or Amazon , but you should never source products from those marketplaces . Here 's why : <h> Why is AliExpress the only marketplace suitable for dropshipping ? <p> You go to AliExpress , and purchase that product using your customer 's delivery address , <p> The supplier ships that product directly to your customer . <p> Your customers should feel that they received their orders from you . And that 's what usually happens . AliExpress suppliers ship products in unbranded packaging with no identification you 're reselling products from AliExpress . That 's how dropshipping should work . <p> Try to go through the above process , but replace AliExpress with Walmart or Amazon . How would your customers feel if they bought a product from you at $20.00 and received a Walmart package with a product carrying a price tag of $10.00 ? <p> Imagine your customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suitable for dropshipping . No matter how appealing it might sound . <h> Automations " What part of my dropshipping business can I automate ? <p> You probably already know how AliExpress dropshipping works " you add a product to your store and after you receive an order , your supplier ships it directly to your customers . You never get to see the product . <p> Oberlo and ShopifiedApp automate almost every part of your AliExpress dropshipping business so you do n't need to spend hours adding products to your store , or filling in customer information after you receive an order . <p> In addition , both apps offer a number of other handy automations : <p> Oberlo <p> ShopifiedApp <p> Automated Product Import <p> + <p> + <p> Automated Order Fulfilment <p> + <p> + <p> Daily Product Sync <p> + <p> + <p> Shipment Tracking <p> + <p> <p> Pricing Automation <p> + <p> + <p> Automated Supplier Change <p> + <p> + <p> There are no game changing differences here . Both apps automate the entire business model . Oberlo has a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows you to create multiple product boards and has a Pinterest sorter tool , but both tools are very similar and there 's no clear winner here . <h> Sustainability " Can I trust my business to you ? <p> You build your entire business around your sourcing solution , which means you should be extremely careful when selecting business partners . <p> For instance , some Oberlo users see well over $100,000 worth of sales every month . Now imagine what would happen if Oberlo closed tomorrow . Your business would probably be gone too . <p> I can assure you it wo n't happen with Oberlo . We 're the oldest and the biggest AliExpress dropshipping solution . We 're a team of 20 people and invest a significant amount of our time in building a sustainable and reliable product . <p> It 's one of our top priorities " to build a product you can trust for your business . <p> Oberlo is the best rated Shopify app in the Shopify App Store Inventory Category . <p> I ca n't say anything specific about ShopifiedApp credibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enter their website . And I could n't find any non-affiliate proof that it works . <p> Oberlo takes support extremely seriously . Our customer success team consists of real e-commerce professionals who can assist you not only with Oberlo or Shopify , but with e-commerce or online marketing in general . <p> Oberlo is way ahead the competition " not only in comparison to ShopifiedApp , but in general comparison to any other tool on the marketplace . <h> Reviews " What are other people saying about us ? <p> You can read Oberlo Reviews on the Shopify App Store : https : //apps.shopify.com/ali . ShopifiedApp is not listed on the Shopify App Store and I could n't find any reviews other than those on their homepage . <p> When looking for reviews of an app , watch out for affiliate links . ShopifiedApp offers fixed plans at $400+ and pays their affiliates 50% commissions on every install their affiliates bring . You might find someone saying good things about them just because they receive $200 if their referrals install ShopifiedApp . <h> Pricing " Do I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricky . <p> Let 's first agree on what features are essential to run an online business of any size . You will definitely need to a ) add products to your store , and then b ) ship them to your customers , right ? <p> To do that with ShopifiedApp , you 'll need to purchase their most expensive plan for $47.00/month . No other plan allows you to actually ship products ! Clearly , we think that 's ridiculous <p> If you want to ship orders to your customers , you 'll need to purchase the most expensive ShopifiedApp plan . <p> At Oberlo , the plans are linked to your order volume . If you receive less than 50 orders per month , you 'll be enjoying Oberlo for free , More than 50 but less than 500 orders per month results in $29.90/month . And if you 're making more than 500 orders per month , you 'll need to subscribe to our Pro plan for $79.90/month . <p> Oberlo does n't  charge you when you do n't earn . <p> The ShopifiedApp also offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can download the Oberlo Chrome Extension totally free " and we do n't call it a plan because an extension by itself does almost nothing . <h> Conclusion <p> ShopifiedApp was launched almost half a year after Oberlo . It 's no surprise they have very similar features and value propositions . <p> Oberlo jumped to the #1 position in the Shopify App Store Inventory category within its first 6 months of existence . We have many small competitors , and we typically do n't do comparisons , but this ShopifiedApp vs Oberlo article was much needed . After reviewing both apps in terms of product sources , automations , sustainability , customer support , ratings , and price , we think it 's clear that the absolute winner is Oberlo . <p> I admit you wo n't necessarily do more with Oberlo . After all , both apps are similar in terms of features . But with Oberlo your business will last longer , you 'll have reliable business partners that do n't try to constantly upsell you , r and you 'll join a community of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our team of 20 people are working on to better serve dropshippers around the world . @qwx196608 <h> Tomas + limas <p> Tomas Slimas has recently sold his $3M dropshipping business and now helps store owners automate their dropshipping stores at Oberlo . <p> Denise Duterte <p> You 're with Oberlo . So its pretty obvious that your blog content will tend to be in favor of Oberlo . Most likely , this is part of your marketing strategy . Shopified App might have been your biggest competitor among other " small " ones that 's why you make it sound like it was indeed a threat and displayed a " hey were still way way better " attitude . For it to be fair between two competitive dropshipping apps , your blog should be objective and contains sound information without being biased which will be really MORE useful for readers and those who may be interested in dropshipping business . Just a thought . <p> Gwen <p> I see that Oberlo and AliExpress go together to form a drop-shipping business , but does Oberlo offer help ( training ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my online store and have woocommerce aliexpress importer in my site but how can I change package from Chinese language to like plain brown package to my logo on the package ? ? Please answer my question <p> Curtis <p> Like when package coming from China reach to customers in USA with Chinese label but how can I change that to my logo on the package ? <p> Hi Curtis , You can see how it should look by default here : LONG ... To get custom packages , you need to contact your supplier and arrange them individually . Its easier when you 're making more sales and your supplier values your partnership more . <p> Curtis <p> Ok thank for your info Well i just telling my developer that they hooked woocommerce aliexpress importer plugin into my website .. i can tell any suppliers to get custom packages ? ? how can i do that ? <p> Branners <p> This article is so far off base it is ridiculous , so let me clear some of this up for you as blatant lies are being told in this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences are MASSIVE <p> I originally used Oberlo , and love it . But that is only because I had not used ShopifiedApp yet . Yes , there is a cost attached to Shopified but you get what you pay for . Let 's break down like vs like shall we : <p> Cost Initially Oberlo seems like the better option due to price . Considering Oberlo had to make their product free just to compete . Once you hit 500 orders , Oberlo whack you with a $79 per month bill . ShopifiedApps Elite plan is $47 per month for unlimited orders , so in the long run ShopifiedApp is way cheaper . <p> Functionality <p> 1 . In the article you state that ShopifiedApp does not have order tracking , this is far from the truth which I am sure you know but though you would blatantly lie anyway . ShopifiedApp offers automatic Order tracking , with Oberlo you have to manually sync AE orders back to Oberlo ( may have changed since I swapped ) . ShopifiedApp also offers ebay Order tracking and will be introducing ebay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . ShopifiedApp also allow you to import products from over 30 different sources , Oberlo only does one . <p> 3 . If a seller runs out of stock for a given product and your Shopify product is bound to that product , you have to then manually order all the products and tie the AE order number and tracking number back to Oberlo . For a couple order this is not an issue , but when you run a flash sale and get 350 order for a product and do n't  realise the seller is out of stock until it is too late . This is a ridiculously BIG problem . With ShopifiedApp , all you do is load backup suppliers and you are GOOD TO GO , no hassle no fuss ( this is why I changed and never looked back ) <p> 4 . Advanced Variant Mapping ShopifiedApp allows you to map multiple AE products against multiple Shopify variants , incredible functionality that Oberlo do not offer or are close to offering as far as I know . <p> Support <p> Support is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need help and quick . I love in the UK , Oberlo is a UK based company . I never got same day replies and most of the time I was told there was nothing that can be done . Support was only available through email ( this may have changed ) . With ShopifiedApp , you have the messaging system and I have yet to have something dealt with outside of that given day . <p> Development and Enhancements <p> Oberlo do not seem to introduce new functionality or update their Chrome extension at all , not very adaptive with an ever evolving web . ( Note this may have changed as it has been a while since I used the app ) . <p> ShopifiedApp are very aggressive with development , if you have a feature request and it makes sense they will include it . They are constantly updating their app and chrome extension . <p> I could go on all day with this as the two products are not comparable in my opinion . I find it also very childish to release this sort of misinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would suggest making your product better and not free , make it better and not lie about others JUST MAKE IT BETTER TO COMPETE <p> And if anyone thinks I may be an employee of their for whatever reason , I am in no way affiliated with ShopifiedApp other than being a loyal customer for life . <p> Branners <p> Side note , I just looked at the date of the article , it was a year ago . So Oberlo have probably improved and a lot of what was said may have been true at the time but is most definitely not true now = <p> Louie <p> If you have a lot of orders your supplier will be able to do this for you . If your supplier will not do this , then you can order your packaging and ship it to your supplier . There are many who can make your packaging with logo printing in China . Ask your supplier if they can help you how to customized your package . <p> Henry <p> Hi good write-up . Also , your polite candor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shopify from creating an Aliexpress importer natively into their application ? <p> How many additional store connection can I use with an account . Because with Shopified App , I pay $ 27/ Month per store extra . If I want to use 3 different stores I pay $ 47 plus $ 27 for each additional store that makes $ 100 per month . <p> Norman <p> That is great when I can test the service of Oberlo for free and as soon as I get more than 50 buyers , I have enough profit to upgrade for the next level . So I can use the service without risk and investment and build step by step my ecommerce Business . I like this great service !

It would be great if you can give me your views on the below points : 1 . How many of you consider Marketing to be a problem ? 2 . If you list down your problems in a priority order , does Marketing come in the top 3 ? 3 . Have you hired/hire any Marketing consultants ? <h> aster <p> I guess you want to offer your services and you are not a part of dropshipping business . <p> IMHO , I do n't suggest to hire a marketing consultat that is not related to dropshipping . It may be a waste of money . Better hire a person that has or have some success in dropshipping and knows how to adjust marketing campaigns in order to get more sales . <h> MattKramer <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world are experiencing the same issue . One half of them consider it as a ton of money thrown out just so people start talking about you . These are trying to keep the costs under the roof , so they will probably have 1 or 2 employees who can be compared to swiss army knives . Even they do n't know what are they doing and in most cases they copy big companies , or read through the whole google . The other half thinks that it 's some sort of foul magic and do n't even bother with it . In the US it 's a bit different , since people accept things like the need of marketing sooner . But in the EU it 's still considered as a big pain . If you are planning to run a consultant business I 'd suggest you to aim for bigger companies as soon as you have the portfolio/experience , until then you have to do everything that it takes to win the respect of small businesses . One thing is for sure , the competition is high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , UX/UI designer and so on .

Maybe it 's the rain outside my bedroom window , or maybe that 's just the autumn blues . Days are becoming shorter , and I swear it gets darker every morning when I wake up . <p> It might as well be the fact that I have been working until midnight yesterday . Or did I just run out of icon ideas ? I reckon that is what they call the creative block . The state of mind when you feel unmotivated and idealess . So how do you overcome this creative block ? <p> I bet every designer experience creative block from time to time . I myself get tired of everything and sometimes feel unable to create anything decent and meaningful ever . Such doubts are natural , and creative blocks like that happen to all of us at some point . The important thing if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it and do n't give up to the creative block . Fight and demolish it once and for all . <p> Becoming outstanding at what you do is all about constant hard work and daily publishing of the outcomes . You have to push yourself everyday , every minute , every second . Since I understood there was no place for creative block in my design routine , I 've found some great tips on how to overcome it . <p> So instead of lying in bed for half an hour , figuring how I could cheat this time : post some old icons or skip the day and do n't post anything at all , like nothing happens , I jumped out of bed , showered , got dressed , then grabbed my bike and rushed down the stairs to the yard . The rain luckily had calmed down a little to that moment , but it was still slightly drizzling . <p> I decided not to take the same path I ride every day to the office , and headed to the completely opposite direction " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock in the morning , so I only met a couple of people jogging there . I pulled off the main road and took the narrow path straight into the woods . <p> This was such a nice and fun half an hour run ! I drove through unseen places , jumped from every road bump on the way and got dirty head to toes ! It was incredibly fun and refreshing . <p> Back home I took a quick shower , changed and got all ready for a new day ahead . And you know what ? On my way to the office I was in a whole different mindset . I made myself a cup of hot coffee and started working on a bike icon set right away . I felt so inspired after the morning ride that I just had to express these feelings through icons . No creative block , no excuses . <p> This story was a nice lead to my first tip on how to overcome creative block : <h> 1 . Shake up your world and daily routine . <p> Do something different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do something you would n't usually do . Having a certain strict routine is a great way to accomplish massive amounts of work . But as productive as it is , routine drains your creative energy . You should shake things up once in a while and do something unexpected.2 . Experience what you 're designing in real life . <h> 2 . Experience what you 're designing in real life . <p> When creating my free space icon set I traveled to the Astronomical Observatory and Planetarium to watch a night sky and explore different planets . This brought my inspiration and excitement for this project to another level . If you have an opportunity , always experience what you 're designing . This will push your work forward , and plus it can be so much fun ! 3 . Always carry your sketchbook with you . <h> 3 . Always carry your sketchbook with you . <p> You never know when the creativity will strike you . You may be sitting in a park or your local coffee shop . And there is hardly anything worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to write them down . To make sure this will not happen to you , always carry your sketchbook wherever you go and feel free to doodle when inspiration comes . <p> Flipping through your old sketches is an amazing way to break through the creative block . You do n't sketch at all ? Well , you should definitely start ! I 've written about the importance of sketching before . Check it out if you still have second thoughts . <h> 4 . Take a break . <p> Making and posting icons every day is quite challenging , as you have to boost your creativity and come up with brand new things day by day . To avoid the creative block , make sure you have regular breaks . Keep in mind that it should be planned in advance ! Yes , even breaks have to be planned . If you get up one morning not in the mood to create anything and simply decide to call it a break , you will only dive deeper into the creative block . Do n't fool yourself ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even weeks ( if you need ) to relax , sort things out in your head and try out something different . <h> 5 . Explore other creative fields . <p> Never lock yourself into one specific field of interest . And when to explore something different if not while on a break from your usual activity ! Use this time to learn how to play an instrument , study photography or do whatever interests you the most . Just do n't sit on the couch watching TV , because lazy breaks like these are a straight path to the creative block . <h> 6 . Develop a habit of daily publishing . <p> It 's simple " you ca n't have a creative block if you have to publish your works daily . When you have made this commitment to yourself , you should stick to it . Everybody expects you to show up . Will you disappoint them ? Hell , no ! You 're gon na present amazing work everyday ! <h> 7 . Set boundaries . <p> As crazy and uncreative as it may sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up really strict constraints and deadlines for the project you 're working on , and you 'll be surprised how this will ignite your creative juices <h> 8 . Have a good night sleep . <p> Productive and creative day starts the day after . Try going to bed early and getting up early . At first , it might be difficult , but you 'll see benefits of it sooner than you expect . If you 're well rested , everything is easier ! Life seems more colourful , problems are less stressful , and creative block is gone ! These are just a few tips that help me overcome the creative block and keep creating and publishing icons every single day . Do you have something to add ? What prevents you from getting into creative block ? How do you overcome and deal with it ?

@@12738315 @1338315/ <h> What is Information Architecture ? <p> Information Architecture ( IA ) is the practice of organizing , structuring and labeling information in a way that makes it easy to find and understand , both in the real world and online . IA encompasses sitemaps , navigation , categorizations , hierarchies , and content types . It directly impacts user experience and on-site conversion rate . <h> Information Architecture of eCommerce stores <p> As leading information architect Jakob Nielsen put it : " If the customer ca n't find the product , the customer ca n't buy it " . Simple as that . Good information architecture can be a central factor in determining your online store 's success . You want your customer to intuitively find what they 're after from the moment they land on the homepage of your site to when they complete the purchase . Excellent user experience , clean design , and organized navigation are the non-negotiable elements for profitable online shops . <p> When you 're planning your store 's navigation , think of it as a bunch of neatly organized folders and subfolders with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main navigation .

Make sure your online store is organized in a logical , top-down structure that has the main categories crumble down into narrower subcategories and ultimately lead the customer to a product page . <p> It 's important to consolidate your main categories as much as possible , but you must make space for your bestselling products . If a particular type of product is bringing you a lot of money , ensure that that category is given a premium spot in your navigation . <p> To help your customers quickly find where they are on the site , employ the breadcrumbs navigation system .

The easiest way to measure the effectiveness of IA is by monitoring user experience . A site that is intuitive and easy to navigate will delight visitors , make their search a breeze and entice them to come back for more . Besides the obvious methods of evaluating the user-friendliness of your site , such as usability testing , you can look at the following metrics as accurate indicators of the UX performance : <p> Bounce rate . The attention span of online shoppers is notoriously short . If they ca n't find what they 're looking for in the first 10s , they 'll most likely leave .

Unfortunately every time this happens is severely delays my shipping times as I have to reorder all the products . I 've tried speaking with Aliexpress and they assure me that it wo n't happen again but I have a feeling since I 'm putting through a lot of orders their system sees it as suspicious and closes all my orders . <p> I 'm US based if that helps . Does anyone run into this problem ? I 'm processing about 60-100 orders a day individually . Any help would be much appreciated this has been a huge roadblock to scaling . @qwx196606 <p> My assumption is that you 're a ' victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We 're currently trying to figure out either the main cause of orders getting canceled or means of preventing this from happening again - our support team is looking into this right now , and we will do our best to tackle this issue . <p> I can only recommend you this Hot Fix : You should contact your suppliers privately and ask whether it is possible to make orders just by sending orders in Excel file and pay for them via Paypal . Alternatively , you can try to use VPN or a bunch of different bank cards ( which you 've tried already but this might be read by others who have n't ) . <p> I 'm assuming that orders are flagged as fraud , and eventually canceled if the system thinks that someone has a stolen American credit card and places an order to be shipped to their home address ( American credit card - delivery to France ) . But orders should n't be blocked if someone is placing an order with their home credit card and ship order to the US ( French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is just an assumption and provided information might not cover all of the reasons why this might be happening .

Shipping options of 40-60+ days ( free ) makes us non competitive ( time + risk ) . Shipping $20-$30 with delivery at 10-20+ days means we can only sell high end items with a minimum cost price of $80 -$120 ( max 20% shipping cost ) .

@@12738336 @1338336/ <p> Some of the examples I 've included in this email are not of eCommerce stores . That 's because it 's rare to see online retailers to do some of these emails like an editorial . I think it 's a missed opportunity . If it works for software companies or services , there is no reason it wo n't work for eCommerce too . Let us learn from other types of business to make our own better . <h> Email marketing templates ideas <p> There are a variety of different ideas on what to send in your emails . Let 's start with 10 different ones to get a feeling of what is possible with email marketing . <h> 1 . Email marketing templates for E-course , training or DIY <p> When you 're selling apparel , the easiest thing you can do is send fashion advice to your customer . The idea here is to help them dress better . You 're showing and teaching them how to look good or find their own style . You can promote how-to videos on pairing colours , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can make it elegant like Trunk Club . They are not dumbing it down for their customers . They trust they have a good sense of style . That 's why they are sending them a style guide instead . With a style guide , Trunk Club is letting their customers browse the latest pieces on the best office wear the company has to offer . <h> 2 . Email marketing templates for customer celebration <p> There is nothing like appreciating your customers . Say thank you . You ca n't be a successful company without them . Facebook sends a small and humble email on the customers birthday . <p> Trello sent out a big thank you email for having 10 million users . The milestone is irrelevant . The idea- is to be humble and appreciate the people who give you their money ( and time ) . <h> 3 . Email marketing templates for product reviews <p> A little while after each purchase send an email to your customers asking for reviews . This has many benefits . First , it let 's your customers know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself , you can use the responses for marketing later . Like I said , email engagement is high so you will be able to gather your customers ' thoughts easily . <p> Take this email from Casper . It 's very quick and to the point . No gimmicks . No jargon . No beating around the bush . It does help that Casper is a very respected company selling quality mattresses . I 'm sure the reviews they receive is a good way for them to keep improving their services . <h> 4 . Email marketing templates for testimonials <p> If you have some serious analytics on your site , you can track what your customers were looking at . You can send them an email about the products in their last abandoned cart , for example . Or , if you 're looking to push sales for a specific product you have in mind , focus on that instead . <p> Above is an example from Revolution , a tea selling company . In their email , they used results of a customer survey to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four different customer testimonies read well . It 's a nice touch that they also gave away a 10% coupon with the email . <h> 5. - Email marketing templates for industry news <p> This email is essentially going to include the latest hot topics from your industry . Did someone debut a new line of sneakers ? What are the fashion icons up to now ? Industry news is a great way to keep your customers informed about what 's been happening and trending recently . <p> Sidebar does this really well . For web design and web development news , they email you once a week with a few highlighted links that are the most interesting from the last week . <h> 6. - Email marketing templates for bBlog excerpts <p> If you have free content on your website , like a blog , send your customers the latest updates . Share your most popular post of the week or a quick snippet about all the posts you published in the last 10 days . If you have a blog you will need to keep driving traffic towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Our community sends a weekly newsletter with all sort of updates . One portion of their email is an update on the blog posts they have published the previous week . It 's a nice way for people to get a quick preview of newly available content to them . They can pick and choose what they find interesting . <h> 7. - Email marketing templates for editorials <p> Consider an editorial when you want to publish a think piece . Of course , you should publish it on your website but also send it in the email too . If you have a strong opinion on what 's been happening in your industry , write about it and send it forward . <p> Crew knows how to do content marketing very well . Although they sell web design services , there is a lot to be learned from them for eCommerce retailers too . They have a blog filled with fantastic web design advice , for free . The blog helped them become well-known . Naturally , they send a quick email once a week with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a quick snippet . The email is focused on just a single post . <p> Just about every business does a promotional email every now and then . You should too ! <p> Brooklinen 's promotional email is there to encourage a first time customer . First , they show off a few of their different items which are followed by the promotion . I like this email format because it allows customers to see the product without throwing the promotion in their face first . <h> 9. - Email marketing templates for new product/service announcements <p> If you are adding a new line of products , tell your customers . It 's going to be hard for them to keep buying from you if they are not kept in the loop on the products you are selling . Again , this is a pretty common practice for all types of business , including eCommerce stores . <p> Uniqlo recently sent out a good email about their fall items . The email is nice to look at , well organized and to the point . A good product announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a quick preview of new and great items . If they are intrigued , they will click through . Pretty straight forward . <h> 10. - Email marketing templates for photos <p> People love photos . It 's not an exaggeration . See if you can come up with something clever and visual with your products . Can you get artistic with them ? How about funny ? Warby Parker did . They did a cute spoof about dogs being cool in the summer by showing a few cute and funny photos of hip looking dogs wearing sunglasses . I 'm sure that email got a lot of engagement ! <h> What to use for email marketing services ? <p> Now that you have some ideas for an email marketing template , where do you find one ? If you 're just starting out with email marketing I suggest using one of the following services . MailChimp has a fantastic interface that is very easy to use , especially for a beginner . All of the services I 'm recommending have ready made templates . This includes MailChimp too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting out I highly recommend using one of their ready-made email marketing templates . MailChimp focuses a lot on newsletter and email marketing . <p> Next , there is SendGrid . SendGrip 's focus is mainly on automated transaction emails . Use them for welcome emails , thank you emails for purchases and review emails . They too come with pre-made templates . <p> Another option is Campaign Monitor . They are a great service if you 're looking to have custom made email marketing templates . One of their key differentiating features is the ability to send multiple email campaigns in segments . <h> What are you going to try ? <p> I 'm excited for you to try some of the ideas mentioned in this post . Whatever you choose , do n't forget that email marketing is a worth file venture with amazing returns . 
@@12738337 @1338337/ <h> sell sets instead of individual items <h> SueWise <p> I am wondering if it possible to sell a product which has several variants as a set . Instead of letting a customer purchase just one , I want them to purchase the set . Then I would like Oberlo to know that this order has variants that need to be fulfilled . <p> If that is not possible , is there a Shopify app that will enable me to control that customers need to choose at least a certain amount of variants . 
@@12738338 @1338338/ <h> Please Help ! <h> johnsonshyne <p> Hi , i 'm new to Oberlo and i have discovered a major issue with my plans to dropship . What i discovered is that once you find a product on Aliexpress and you import the product using the Oberlo app , you can then find that product under the " import list " and you can edit the variants etc before you push that product to your store on Shopify . Here 's where it get tricky , the pricing rules i assumed could be set for each individual product and it 's variants . <p> ( See example below ) Product ( XYZ ) is a ( Ladies Hand-bag ) and has 4 sizes ( S , M , L , XL ) let 's say for this example that product XYZ costs $20.00 ( postage included ) and i want to to set a " profit " margin of 50% so i set my multiplier to 1.5 and so i do this before pushing my product to my store . However , I still want the price to be tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of product XYZ from $20.00 to $30.00 the multiplier will remain at 1.5 and thus the price on my store will change accordingly to $45.00 . I will receive an email and if i feel that the price change has eaten too much into my profit margin and the realistic cost of what any customer is willing to pay for a hand-bag then I can leave the price as it is , or adjust my multiplier or remove the product completely . <p> Now i do n't want a global pricing rule for all product prices to be affected by the same multiplier of 1.5 because other wise it wo n't make any sense ! The cost and value of each product can differ by a great margin . Let 's say I have now seen a new product ( ABC ) this product a mobile phone case that on Aliexpress costs $2 ( Shipping is free ) and i know that i could sell it for an easy $6 bucks .

@@12738346 @1338346/ <h> Domestic vs Overseas <p> The first question everyone needs to answer is whether you want your suppliers to be domestic or from overseas . Of course , both have their advantages and disadvantages . It will boil down to your personal preference , the products you 're selling or your own values . <h> Advantages and disadvantages of domestic wholesale clothing suppliers <p> Let 's start with the advantages of using a domestic wholesale clothing supplier . Because they are located domestically , the shipping time will significantly shorter . Communication will be easier because there will be no language barrier between you and the supplier . This could yield to fewer errors and mistakes . Additionally , the quality of manufacturing should be higher . The two biggest disadvantages include the limited amount of products to choose from and their higher costs . There are fewer products being made in America than overseas in places like China or India . And , due to the higher quality of products and better labor laws here , the price of goods will be much higher . <h> Advantages and disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you is overseas manufacturing . This one too comes with a few advantages of its own such as lower manufacturing costs . This is especially true if you compare it to manufacturers in America . That 's unfortunately due to lower labor standards and lower quality products . On the plus side , there are a lot of wholesale supplier to choose from , especially clothing suppliers . Because of services like Aliexpress , it 's easy to get started working with overseas suppliers . <p> Some of other disadvantages include longer shipping time . Most of these manufacturers are in China . It 's going to take longer to deliver the product to your customer in North America . You might occasionally run into issues with customs too . You wo n't be able to visit the manufacturers in person , at least not cheaply . Verifying products could be a big hassle if not a big problem . Cultural differences and language barriers could cause more errors , mistakes and headaches for you . <p> Where to search for a supplier ? <p> The best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directories . This is true for both domestic and overseas supplier . As far as domestic directories I recommend getting started with- Maker 's Row , - ThomasNet , - let 's make it here , or- Sqetch . If you 're interested in overseas supplier you could start with- Alibaba- and- IndiaMart . However , I highly recommend using- AliExpress- for a drop shipping businesses . They have a very good list of wholesale clothing suppliers . You can read more about how to find the best possible supplier for your here . They have over 700,000 suppliers from Asia and millions of products to choose from . <p> Another thing you can try is just using Google . Most of the suppliers ' websites are old and outdated. - Google rewards websites that are constantly updated so the manufacturers will be buried . That 's why they wo n't rank high on a search . You will have to dig deep into page 5 or 6 of your search to find anything useful . I do n't recommend doing this unless you have plenty of time and patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a supplier try relying on referrals and the word of mouth . If you know people in the business ask them for recommendations . Contact people who might be able to help you , even if you do n't know them personally . People are always willing to help- if you know how to ask them . If- you're- sill uncomfortable in reaching out you can try online forms . Also , do some research on social media as well . There is already plenty of information out there for you to read . <p> If you 've got the time and the money you might consider going to trade shows . Its just one more option for you to look into. - 10times- and- Trade Show News Network- will help locate a trade show in your area . You can go and check out the individual wholesalers in person .

Who knows who you might meet at such events ? <p> How do you request a quote ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out if they can in fact deliver . Your first communication with the supplier is likely going to be a request for quotation . Request for quotation , RFQ , is the name of the game with wholesale suppliers of any kind . It 's the only way to find out the prices from a supplier ; you 'll get the hang of it very quickly because you will be doing it often . Basically , you 're sending an email asking how much something is based on the quantity you want to buy . However , nothing is this simple . You should treat it as a serious business inquiry instead of an IM between you and the supplier . You should plan your email to get the best possible response . - Do n't  waste your- time by going back and forth on missing pieces of information . <p> You want to be informed on a few things starting with the supplier 's minimum order quantity , MOQ . This differs from supplier to supplier . You need to know if you can afford and handle the minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to ask : how much their products will cost you . Most suppliers do high discount pricing for higher quantity orders . Ask for the price of various quantities to get a feel for their production pricing . <p> Next , you need to find out the turnaround time and shipping terms . Timing is everything in a drop shipping business . How long does it take them to ship the item to your customer is important . You need to know if an item will take a long time to ship , or not . Additionally , you 'll also need to ask about their payment terms to make sure you 're okay with how they charge for their products. - As with everything , it varies from supplier to supplier . You do n't want to be surprised about how they expect you to pay for the inventory . <p> The very last thing you want to ask is about their samples . Some suppliers provide discounted rates for them , some do n't . It 's important to ask and to order some if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feel for the products you will be selling to your own customer . This last step of contacting the supplier for an RFQ will ultimately let you judge them to be a good fit for you . If they are not , move on to the next one , there are plenty to choose from . <h> Now you know how to find wholesale clothing supplier ! <p> Getting started with a wholesale clothing supplier will need to happen sooner than later . Its a matter of doing your due diligence and researching the suppliers on various platforms . After all , you need to find the perfect one . The one that will supply you the products you want for the right price . Its a lot of screening , but its all worth it in the end when you 'll have happy paying customers . <p> Well , your advices is really useful . But I really doubt that the best place for wholesale purchasing is Alibaba . Yes , you can find there a lot of examples and deals , but most of them are China based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of business culture and international experience .

A few reliable tactics you can try are : <p> Skip the mandatory registration : more and more users expect to have the guest checkout option when they proceed to the payment page .

Referral sources can further help you determine where to spend valuable marketing dollars and what efforts result in the biggest rewards . <h> Add-to-cart events <p> What happens when a user adds something to the shopping cart ? eCommerce statistics can tell you if a sale was processed ( or not ) . <p> When it comes to analyzing cart events , it is important to look at three actions : <p> Additions to the cart and actual sales . <p> Errors in the cart . <p> Number of carts abandoned before the sale is processed . <p> Errors and abandoned carts are key add-to-cart statistics to keep an eye on . If these numbers seem high or jump unexpectedly , it could indicate a website problem . <h> Proceed to checkout <p> It is common for customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually get to the checkout phase . Collect checkout traffic information to know how many users are converting to sales . This is a little different than just looking at add-to-cart events , because you are taking the next step from adding to cart to initiating the checkout process . <p> Here 's why this matters : The customer has indicated by going to the checkout page that a sale is wanted . When conversions fail at this stage you need to know why and remedy the process . Common problems include shipping prices ( customers often balk at shipping costs ) , difficult user interface , security concerns or payment options and the lack of a mobile option , according to HubSpot . <h> Transactions <p> How do sales look ? Daily transaction tracking should be at the top of your eCommerce statistics checklist . Compare transaction numbers by day , week , month and year to get a firm grasp on how your business is doing . Is it growing or slowing ? This metric can tell you at a glance . <p> Transaction details can also help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand . It 's a great overview barometer . You can glance at these numbers to start your day and chart a path forward . <h> Errors of any kind <p> Tracking errors might seem like no fun , but errors can be a major cause of lost customers . It 's your job to figure out where things might be going wrong in the shopping experience . <h> Search results <p> Find out what users type into the search bar and you have instant access to what they want from your eCommerce website . This is one of the most overlooked elements in a website design . <p> Take the search information and push popular items in marketing campaigns , on the homepage or develop new products . Remember to track search events that provide results as well as those that do not . Why ? If users are consistently searching for a product you do n't have , you might want to consider stocking it . <h> Payment type <p> Security and payment processing is a major concern for most online shoppers . Are you providing the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eCommerce statistic to track is the type of payment method used . <p> What are the most popular payment methods ? Type of credit card , Paypal or other processor . <p> Do certain payment types have higher cart abandonment rates ? <h> Promotions and codes <p> Promo codes and sales are a stellar way to drive traffic . But do they work ? And which ones are the most successful ? Track each of the special codes you put out there for customers and see which codes translate to more sales . <p> Is it free shipping or a percent-off discount ? <p> Is it a code from a web-based ad , Facebook promotion or postcard ? <p> Are the codes redeemed by new or returning users ? <h> Social media shares <p> Track whenever a shopper shares an item ( before or after a sale ) , promotion or content on social networks . This information can help you analyze user desires and popularity of items , promotions or viral nature of a product . If a certain product gets a lot of attention on social media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales . <h> Form field success <p> Your eCommerce website is packed with forms . From signing up for an email list to entering payment information , form field statistics can show where stumbling blocks exist and what information users do and do not want to share . <p> There 's a delicate balance to form field tracking though . Some fields are important for data collection , such as email address or postal code , but other information should not be kept ( such as credit card data ) . The part that is important is to know which fields users are leaving blank and how to streamline form fields for easier input and particularly checkout . <p> There 's growing momentum for a less-is-more strategy when it comes to eCommerce checkout fields , and customers seem to really appreciate it . <h> Repeat customers <p> Your most important customer is a loyal customer . While most analytics tools wo n't give you all the data you need about this eCommerce statistic , there are ways to pull this information together . Use a combination of analytics " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as surveys to get a good idea of who is shopping over and over again . <p> If you want to try a survey to collect this data , entice customers with a coupon code . It can be equally as important to know why customers do n't come back , so try asking that in a simple one-question survey as well . <h> Conversion rates <p> Every button and promotion leading to and on your website should end with a customer action . Are you converting casual visitors into sales ? <p> Do customers click calls-to-action and fill out forms ? <p> Do they click internal links ? <p> What is the funnel from social media to product listing ? <p> Do shoppers actually make purchases ? <p> The conversion rates for different actions will vary , and that 's okay . Here 's what to pay particular attention to : Which pages or calls-to-action lead to the highest conversion rates ? Replicate these in as many places as you can . <h> Revenue <p> The top eCommerce statistic you need to track is revenue . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this number daily/weekly/monthly . The tools might be built into your eCommerce website platform , through Google Analytics or through accounting software . But if you are n't tracking revenue , what in the world are you doing ? <p> Consider tracking revenue in several different ways , such as the following : <p> Total sales in relationship to campaigns . <p> By product to identify popular items . <p> To keep track of inventory . <p> To determine how price changes impact sales . <p> At the end of the day , the final goal of all eCommerce statistics is to give you the tools to grow a successful business . It may seem like a lot of data analysis , but with proper setup and automation the benefits far outweigh costs . Good luck and happy selling !

You 'll want to incorporate graphics , images , and video to add more color and personality into your page . Having a long blog of text does n't usually compel customers to want to read on . By adding visual components , you help bring the story you 're telling to life . Disney is a great example of about us page design . They use a unique color-combination of gold and green throughout their page.Instead of a plain white background they use a soft yellow to give that extra pop of color . They transition between yellow and blue to keep the layout of the page interesting . All leadership photographs were taken in an outdoor setting to maintain the fresh green in their color scheme . They layout their images in a zigzag format to move a person 's eyes across the screen . They also use gifs in their history slider .

If you 've won awards or accomplished goals you can include those into your timelines as well . Adding pictures of your company 's big wins helps make the page pop . Burberry has one of the most unique timeline 's in their about us page . Their brand starts at 1856 and goes through historical fashion moments . From military photos of their trench coats to a blue flying suit . The imagery within their timeline looks historic giving the brand more credibility . <h> Include a Mission or Vision Statement <p> Mission and vision statements belong on about us pages .

You 've just hyped up your company to a potential customer , why would n't they want to work for you ?

Many spend their time perfecting the appearance of their store and fail to do what really matters : marketing . Some of the tactics in this article will require a lot of experimentation while others while require a time commitment . However , if you 're serious about the future and growth of your business it 's essential that you drive traffic to your online store no matter how much work it is . Here are 7 ways to drive traffic to your ecommerce store : <h> 1 . Drive traffic to your ecommerce store with Facebook Ads <p> Facebook Ads are one of the best ways to drive traffic to your ecommerce store . It is n't easy and it requires a bit of experimentation . However , once you find your winning ad , things get a whole lot easier . <p> You 'll need to test several things when creating an ad . You 'll need to test various products , copy and images to find one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different types of Facebook ads . For example , I find boosting posts brings in more traffic and generates more sales for one of my stores than a Facebook ad for conversions . <p> Making sure you have a vibrant or attention-grabbing , high res picture that stands out against Facebook 's platform is essential . The purpose of the image in the ad is to appeal to someone to make an emotional impulse buy . <p> Look at the picture below , an adorable baby wearing a headband would be a great impulse buy purchase from pregnant woman who 's purchasing things for her future baby . Since she 's still pregnant , when she sees another baby she becomes emotional making her perfect for an impulse buy . Ads featuring impulse buy products help drive traffic to your online store . You 'd want to photoshop the brand name out of the image before creating the ad though . <p> When creating the ad , you 'll want to include the price in the post to ensure your leads are qualified . If they 're unaware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right off the page . <p> A tool I regularly use is fb-search.com . It allows you to see boosted post ads of your competitors and posts related to your niche . This will allow you to see what type of ad or post gets the most engagement . Also , you can search for posts of for specific brands or keywords . For example , if you search Walmart , you 'll find posts from Walmart . However , you 'll also find posts of people talking about Walmart so you can find out what people are saying about the brand . Also , feel free to look up your own brand on it to see what people are publicly saying about you on their personal Facebook pages . <p> Make sure when creating Facebook ads that you set up a pixel and retarget your visitors . Some may be more likely to buy from your brand the second or third time around . <h> 2 . Drive traffic to your online store by writing blog content <p> It may take a few months of consistent effort to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your online store . It can take at least 4-6 months for articles to start ranking in the search engines . This is especially useful if you 're on a tight budget . However , blogging requires patience and commitment for a long time to drive traffic to your ecommerce store . <p> You 'll need to make sure you have an SEO plug-in on your store to ensure that your blog posts are highly optimized . Your blog posts need to be at least 1500 words . You 'll also want to make sure that you post videos , images and links to other blog posts . The more content in your blog posts the more likely you are to rank in the search engines . <p> A trick I do to drive traffic on my ecommerce store is that I mention public figures in my niche in my blog posts . Then , I contact them to let them know I featured them . I 'll casually mention in the email that they can share the article with their audience if they want but no pressure . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . If you have a retargeting ad going , converting the one time traffic is even easier ( and cheaper ) . <p> A tool I use to help me figure out popular topics , within my niche , to write about is Buzzsumo . First , enter your niche into the search bar . Then , look at the social shares and engagement to determine which topics you can write about on your blog . <p> You 'll need to share your blog post on social media to get more reach out of your audience . In the beginning , posting content on social media wo n't get much engagement . However , keep doing it so people know your store is still active . Use hashtags to give your blog posts a better chance of driving traffic to your online store . <h> 3 . Include a CTA in all social media posts to drive traffic to your ecommerce store <p> Every post on social media should direct people to a blog or product page . Even if you 're posting a picture that has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check out your website . <p> There have been times when I posted something just for fun and did n't tell people to check out our website . When your post gets 50,000 views and there 's no link to your website , you 're going to regret it . I know I have . <p> You never know what type of post will go viral . Sometimes , you try really hard to create a viral post and it gets no engagement . Other times , you do n't try at all and your account explodes . Always direct people to your website to drive traffic traffic to your ecommerce store . <p> Customer reviews have two purposes : help convert buyer and improve your search ranking . The reason why product reviews are great for driving traffic is because Google will keep crawling your product page to see if there 's new content . Most do n't regularly update product pages . Yet , with product reviews customers are adding content to your page for you keeping it fresh . Thus , the more reviews your product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it shows that your page is still active . It 's a long-term SEO play but worthwhile in the end . <p> In addition , customers who leave positive reviews are more likely to let their friends know about their purchase . The Product Reviews Addon app , in the Shopify app store , allows customers who leave a positive review to share their review on their social media . If their network sees the post , they may be more likely to buy the reviewed product from your store . <p> Building out your referral traffic is a must when starting out . Magazines , bloggers and influencers have large audiences who may be interested in buying your product . Sending free samples is the easiest way to convince big publications to consider your brand . <p> When emailing the magazine , keep in mind that they get countless product pitches every day . You 'll need to be to the point and personal . Here 's a sample email you can send : <p> Hey Name , <p> I loved your recent post about post topic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Publication Name for years . I recently launched a new product on my store Store Name . The product name is currently our best-selling product . Add compelling selling feature or quick description . People ca n't get enough of it . I think Publication Name 's audience would love it too . If you 're interested , I 'll send you a free sample so you can check it out for yourself . Here 's the product page : add link <p> Hope you have a fantastic day ! <p> Your Name <p> You can also attach a press release with the email if you send to a publication . The press release details more information about the product and company . It is n't usually necessary if you email a blogger or an influencer . <p> If the person does n't get back to you within three days , send a follow-up email . Most usually respond the second time around if they 're interested . After samples have been received , follow up again to ask if they have any questions or need any other information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your website in the post to drive traffic to your ecommerce store . <h> 6 . Master email marketing to drive traffic to your ecommerce store <p> Email marketing can easily drive traffic to your online store . If you 've had a few customers but do n't have n't actually tried building a list , you can contact former customers who ticked off that they 're interested in marketing . <p> Most neglect their own customers . Instead , they focus on getting new customers . This is a huge mistake . Customers have already purchased from you . They know your product quality . They know your brand . They 're more likely to buy from you again . Getting them to buy from you is much easier ( and cheaper ) than trying to get new customers . Retention is just as important as lead generation . <p> To build out your email list , encourage your potential customers to opt in for a free digital product . For example , if you sell arts and crafts products offering them a free printable or ebook via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once you 've built out your email list , you 'll need to contact your customers regularly , such as once a week . You might share blog posts , new product additions and special sales via email . This will help drive traffic back to your ecommerce store . <p> Writing guests posts on niche blogs can help drive traffic to your ecommerce store . However , to get your content featured on a guest blog it needs to provide value to the blog 's audience . Some blogs will set really strict rules . Do n't be intimidated by it . It usually means they have a big audience and do n't want to risk losing them . <p> You 're going to have to ensure you do n't add product photos or make a sales pitch as your guest blog . If you focus on providing content people love , it 's more likely to get shares and click throughs to your website . A person who checks out your website from another blog may not be ready to buy .

You can also talk to MBA students or undergraduates who 've started their own businesses and ask for their advice when you hit roadblocks . <h> You Have Nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have nothing to lose . Money ? You 're probably already used to bootstrapping and low pay jobs . Failure ? You 're so young that you 're still in school . This is your time to make mistakes and try new things . Bills ? You likely do n't own a mortgage , have kids or any major bills to pay . Student loans do n't need to be paid for until after graduation and if you play your cards right you can pay them off quickly . Social approval ? Your parents probably are n't around you often enough to steer you from starting a business in college . Your friends will likely support you and if they do n't hang with the business students and they will . <h> Looks Great on a Resume When You Graduate <p> Good grades are n't enough to land you your dream job after graduation .

You can be asked to be paired up with a fellow entrepreneur who can guide you in your college business . <p> Depending on your government , students may be able to access grants for starting college businesses in the summer . You 'll receive a grant to cover some of your business costs during the summer so that you can start-up a business . Some programs also include a mentorship aspect to it to help ensure your summer business succeeds .

If you provide a reference letter and provide your volunteers with growth opportunities , it can be easy to recruit people to help . You can have marketing students volunteer to create Facebook Ads , write blog content or market on social media . You can ask accounting students to volunteer to help create a budget and determine how to manage finances effectively . <h> You Also Have Access to Computers , Internet , and a Library <p> While most people own computers and have access to an internet connection , your school does have resources that you can use for your college business .

This type of business is typically good for side income . It 's also typically a short-term business . <p> Ecommerce Ecommerce businesses are great college businesses . Students can make products from their dorm room such as jewelry , beauty products , or beard oils . Then , they can sell the products online . Students can also create print on demand businesses where they can design their own t-shirts and sell them for a profit .

Do AliExpress products in the category get thousands of orders or none ? <p> Create your Store for Free Most ecommerce entrepreneurs use Shopify as their platform to host their store . While Shopify does have a monthly fee , they do have a free 30-day trial which allows you to test it out for yourself . Shopify is the WordPress for ecommerce stores . <p> Get your Vanity URLs <p> You 'll want to purchase a domain name for your store . Shopify has free domain names with . myshopify.com included .

Product images have a zoom picture which allows customer to have a better look at your image . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who shop on their phones . This could come in handy if your business caters to people who are in college , like you . It 's also the highest rated free theme in the store so it 's worth checking out . <p> Make the Website Look Active <p> You 'll want to start building out your store to make it look like an active and professional website . You should write a couple of blog posts to show that your store is producing content . Add banner images to your homepage . Add social media buttons and make sure you 've added a few posts on your pages . Add an About Us page and talk about your brand who you are , what you do and why you do it . You should also include a Contact Us page so that customers can easily contact you with their questions . It also builds trust . <p> Start Marketing Your Store <p> Depending on your niche , you may want to choose to target different audiences . Many niches generate revenue through Facebook Ads . Others grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with influence at your college to post your products on their Instagram or Snapchat . If you decide to buy a couple of items , you can have your friends model your products such as phone cases , clothing or other product .

Will I have lots of complaints ? <p> Finally do you insert shipping times on your product page ( however this will reduce conversion ) or thank you e-mails ? <p> I noted expedited shipping rates for most of my products usually cost more than the product themselves so this is not feasible at all using AliExpress . <p> I maybe a bit of a perfectionist , so let me know if this is a valid concern and how have you dealt with it ? <h> Paulius <p> Hi there ! <p> It seems obvious that long shipping times might seem as a drawback to your business . However , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their item 's whereabouts , they are unlikely to pose significant problems to you . <p> It is important that you set your customer expectations before they make a purchase on your Store .

Create a designated page " Shipping FAQ " or simply " FAQ " where you would answer most common questions . <p> Also , you can mention shipping times on your product page , but it is not necessary .

@@12738372 @1338372/ <h> Aliexpress obstacles , need real-life experiences please , thanks . <h> johnsonshyne <p> Hi , so i came across the drop-shipping idea like a month or just over a month ago . At first my mind exploded into a billion pieces just thinking of all the possibilities but of course the reality is always a bit different . I guess what i would really like to know as i 'm yet to sell or even purchase one product myself , from Aliexpress . Here it comes ... What are people doing about selling branded items , there are brands and some of which i can not make out if it 's the suppliers own brand name of if it 's an actual brand with a legal entity in the EU or US . I do n't want to be served court papers and i 'm just wondering what are the legal boundaries here ? If there are any lawyers on here by chance lol . Also drop-shipping returns , you sell on your site and the customer says , item is damaged and it 's not but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged , what are the chances of actually getting your money back ? ... Is it more headache that is worth getting reimbursed by supplier or Aliexpress ? <p> I have been back any for this these issues and only reason i 'm even still considering posting this is cause there are other wholesalers in the UK which i can get good from but stock management and uploading products manuall/ content posting , without the help of tools like Oberlo just makes it seem like nothing good can come out of it . <p> is Aliexpress worth it , is there any real money to be made ? <h> aster <p> You ca n't sell branded items . Only chinese brands from authorized sellers . Anyway , aliexpress do not allow brands on their web-site ( copies , replicas ) . So if you found a product on aliexpress - you can sell it . About returns : if a cusomer want a refund they must prove that the item is damaged or not working ( photos , videos ) and there are 2 types of refunds : full refund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is damaged ) and partial refund ( when the item is not as described or have a minor damage ) . You can contact your supplier in both of cases and to ask for a refund from him . But my recommandation is to refund you client without asking your supplier for a refund too . If you supplier have a lot of complains and a lot of damaged items - just find another one . If my clients want a refund , I will give them a partial refund ( my profit ) and I allow them to keep the item . This is the perfect way to deal with returns/refunds. <h> johnsonshyne <p> aster Wow thanks ! That was insightful , i do like the idea of a partial refund if the client is happy with this offer . However i leave in the UK and well the law is a bit less different when it comes to " Distant selling regulations " . <p> The Distance Selling Regulations ( DSRs ) are the rules that apply if you are selling products or services to consumers without face-to-face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to examine the goods before buying or discuss the service in person . Examples of distance selling include selling via : the internet , text message , phone call , fax and interactive TV or mail order . <p> I have to give the client a full refund within 7 working days if the request it regardless of if the item came as described and in the right amount of time and i must send them an email to inform them that they have 7 working days to cancel the order from the day they receive the item . I will also have to refund the total cost of the item including the postage cost within this period . I can however stipulate that they have to pay for the return shipping cost if they wish to cancel for reasons other than ( The item being damaged , or not as described ) . So i 'm not sure where that partial refund will stand legally unless i suppose i can get written confirmation via email from the client confirming that they are happy for this to happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refund them the full amount ? <h> RiaSmiya <p> aster Actually not true about the replica and copies , we are building an ecommerce on clothing and I can tell you that there are tones of copies of renown brands as Gucci , Prada , Fear of God and also smaller designers etc .. even on product like bags and jewelry 70% are replica or copies of Western Brands . The suppliers often display pictures of the real product to attract more customers . <h> aster <p> Sure , if the client does not agree with partial refund + keeping the item I can give a full refund , but here is the funny part : they will pay return shipping and will wait 30 days the item to arrive to the supplier , after that another 2 weeks for checking and after that time he will receive the full refund . It is way more convenable for them to accept instant partial refund and to keep the item . <h> tmf2004 <p> Of course you can do everything yourself if you want .. If you have suppliers and want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .. Oberlo and shopify just make it easier no inventory to haggle with .. This right here is a great platform to start .. No one says you need Oberlo and Aliexpress .. If you can create something and brand something yourself you can do that as well .. Shopify gives you the advantage to send invoices and pay right in front of you with Shop POS . If you find the right niche and product anything is possible . Those success stories that you read about are true .. Right product and right marketing tactics .. <h> aster <p> RiaSmiya I was referred to copies and replicas that use original logos.

@@12738374 @1338374/ <p> Instagram is one of my favourite social medias . It is filled with high-quality content . This post will walk you through how to use Instagram for you dropshipping business , as the name suggests . We also wrote a post about Instagram marketing tips for when you 're done with this post . Like I said , Instagram is a great platform and it should be part of everyone 's social media marketing plan . With all that said , let 's dive in . <h> Why is Instagram an important platform ? <p> Oh my , where do I even start ? 70% of Instagram users report they have looked up a company on the platform . 62% of Instagram users follow a company on Instagram . There are more companies using Twitter and Facebook than they are using Instagram . This is a great advantage of an unsaturated market . The integration of hashtags and the explore section in the app make finding new users to follow a lot easier than either Facebook or Twitter . So , it 's going to be much easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The one very interesting thing about Instagram is the amount of posting one should do . On both , Facebook and Twitter , posting often is not the best idea . But posting often on Instagram leads to higher engagement . Posting once a day is sometimes not even that good enough . There are numerous companies on Instagram who post multiple times a day to maximize their engagement . <p> The demographics of Instagram are interesting too . As much as 29% online females use Instagram vs 22% males . Whereas 53% of 18-29 years olds use Instagram . That 's every other person in that age group . If you 're looking for more information on the statistics- Buffer has a great report . <h> Setting up your profile <p> There are three key things you should know about your Instagram profile . Its essential that you follow these tips if you want to understand how to use Instagram for your dropshipping business . If you want to know how to use Instagram , a profile is going to be a practical first step . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo ; it should be of your company 's logo . Anything else is not going to be recognizable . The second thing to get right is your description or bio . It 's a little bit of text that let 's you share and explain who is behind the account and what the photos are about . A good start is to include a quick outline of who you are and what you do . That 's it really . <p> The third thing to know about is your link . Unlike any other social media really , Instagram does not allow many links . Frankly , they only allow one in your bio . You ca n't have links from individual photos . You can update your bio link as much as you want . Of course , the link should go to your website . But , if you 're currently running a sale , link to that instead . Post a photo related to the sale and update your bio link . It 's a pretty common practice since there is n't much else one should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media or marketing efforts , you should have a strategy . There are already plenty of detailed articles about content strategies on Oberlo . But I will give you the gist of it . A good content strategy let 's you measure how successful your campaigns are . You are going to set goals and track them . You would observe how the thing you post are doing and learn from them . Over time , you 'd learn quite a lot , especially how to use Instagram to your advantage . This would not only give you more confidence and knowledge but strategically drive more followers , engagement , traffic and even sales your way . Here is a link to a post all about creating a content strategy for your drop shipping business . <h> Elements of a highly performing account <p> One key thing about using Instagram is the style your profile will develop . In order to learn how to use Instagram , you will have to feel artistic and creative at least a little . Because the platform is photo based , it will require good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to go over with you how to create a visual style guide that will help to create and posting photos much easier . A style guide is a set of rules or guidelines that you 're going to have to follow for each post you make . A style guide is great in keeping things consistent . They are present in all sorts of jobs like web design , blogging and , yes , social media . Let 's dive into what your Instagram style guide should consist of . <p> Composition <p> Composition means the content of the photo . How will it look ? What will it show ? You can specify that you will only post photos of shirts against a solid background . Some accounts post- pretty busy photos but they are consistent in their composition . It will depend on your style and photography skills . The composition should also define what should and should n't be a subject in photos . For instance , if you are only selling t-shirts , it 's going to be inconsistent for you to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also specifically exclude items that you know do n't make sense for your account . <p> Colors and fonts <p> Having a colour palette means that your photos will look a certain way . This should n't limit you to posting photos that are only recolored to be fully yellow . Right now the fall is upon us in the US so it 's natural for many companies posting fall themed images . They are usually orange , green and brown in nature . That 's one way to define colour . The second way is a lot more creative . What if you only posted yellow photos ? What if you only posted images of solid coloured items ? That is all up to you to define . <p> You should also pick a font to use for your images . Every now and again you will post a photo with text in it . Do n't forget to specify the style of the font too . It 's most likely going to be the same font used on your website . Or not . <p> Filters <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filters are a big part of it . A filter could mean posting only black and white photos . It can also mean a very complicated set of settings . With filters , you should specify and show the end product you 're going for too . Filters pertain to a verity of characteristics of a photo . But , lighting , contrast , and brightness are easily the- three most common ones . Are you going to post bright photos- or dark ones ? Define it in your style guide . <p> Captions <p> Now we are moving away from the photo itself but to the caption . A consistency in captions is also a good thing . Do you captions say something witty ? Do they share a little tidbit of information about the item you 're showing off ? Whatever the caption may be , define it . If you want to go a little further and define the tone of voice , that will also improve the quality of your posts . <p> The last thing on the list is hashtags . Are there any specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again ? Are there hashtags that you do n't want to be used at all ? For instance , it could be a competitor 's hashtag or something irrelevant and saturated like #l4l . <h> Final thoughts on how to use Instagram <p> Alright , now that you got through it all you should be all set to start using Instagram . Learning anything new can be intimidating . But , also like with learning about anything , it 's a matter of trying . These five points went over the basics that will set you up well to use Instagram . <p> I currently use Instagram marketing and I have n't been as effective doing it .

@@12738378 @1338378/ <p> While many ecommerce entrepreneurs dream of creating a mega brand store like Walmart , Amazon or QVC , starting out as a niche store can sometimes be the most-effective path to get you there . In this article , you 'll learn eight reasons to start a niche store . <p> Start Focused , Expand Later <p> According to Entrepreneur , when Jeff Bezos first launched Amazon , he only sold books . He recognized that while bookstores could only hold a few hundred books due to their small retail space , with a virtual store the possibilities were endless . He dreamed of selling millions of books online . Keep in mind this was back in 1995 before most people even had internet . <p> Bezos ' eventually expanded into other categories like CD 's . However , during a holiday promotion he decided to temporarily sell toys and games . It 's clear that Bezos ' was actually testing the market to determine whether or not Amazon should expand into even more categories . Eventually , Amazon became the biggest marketplace where consumers can buy virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not stuck to the niche you start in . You can always expand into other categories . The benefit of this strategy is that it allows you to have tunnel vision on your store rather than bouncing from one idea to the next . Many business ' fail because their focus is n't clear . When building your first store , avoid having a brand name that 'll limit you . For example , Amazon despite starting out as a bookstore , did n't have books ' or bookstore ' in its domain . This allowed Amazon to expand into other categories easily . <p> Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos .

' Specific niches typically have less competition than general ones . According to his bio , Sam Walton created Walmart because he saw the need for a discount retail store for rural areas . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Many think that a niche is a product category . However , in the case of Walmart , their niche is focused on providing the best price to everyone even those in rural areas . While it can be risky to be in a less competitive niche , if success is achieved , you can potentially achieve greater rewards . <p> Also , it 's a lot less competitive to have a store with crossfit products than trying to cater to everyone with a general fitness store . It 's better to be number one in crossfit than number 100,000 in fitness . <p> Photo : Daniel Acker/Bloomberg <h> More Likely to Succeed <p> Billionaire Sara Blakely , founder of Spanx , once said , I was trying to convince all these men to try to make a product that they did n't  even wear !

Today , Spanx 's niche focus is on figure-flattering undergarments such as maternity hosiery , leggings and bras . <p> It 's a lot easier to start up a niche store rather than trying to build a mega-empire your first try . With a niche store , you have a stronger understanding of what type of products your target audience would be interested because you can clearly define your target audience . Sometimes , when entrepreneurs try to create a store with a wide range of products from varying categories like dog products and makeup , it falls flat . You can always expand into other categories in the future . However , starting your store with a niche focus can give you better chances of success . <p> Photo : Rob Brinson <h> Gain a Reputation <p> In 1969 , Sephora founder Dominique Mandonnaud found his niche by reinventing the way perfume and beauty products are sold . At the time , shoppers had to buy products without knowing how it would look or smell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to smell different perfumes which helped grow Sephora into a popular store .

The try before you buy model in the beauty niche differentiated Sephora from other brands . <p> Having a reputation or being known for ' a particular niche can greatly benefit your store . For example , if someone asked for a recommendation on where to buy a certain foundation , someone might recommend Sephora because it allows customers to try on beauty products . <p> Also , you improve your odds of getting return customers . When a customer understands what type of products or experience you sell , they 'll be more likely to keep returning for it . <p> Photo : Dexigner <h> Marketing Becomes Simplified <p> When Steve Jobs was working at Apple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were selling computers and laptops . However , Apple 's products were more visually appealing . It was a simple but effective way to stand out .

It 's easier to create a marketing campaign when you know your unique selling proposition . It 's easier to market to your customers when you understand how you bring them value . When you understand your niche , building out a content strategy , social media following or creating an ad becomes easier . <p> Photo : The Film Stage <h> Easier to Attract an Audience <p> It 's easier to attract an audience when running a niche store than trying to cater to everyone . You 'll be able to create highly targeted ads because you 'll easily understand the demographics . You 'll know what age group , gender or interests to target . When you position your brand , create a mission statement or write your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it clearly in one sentence . <p> Also , you 'll attract an audience because you know how to create content specifically for them . It 'll be easy to provide value because of your singular focus . When creating content , you 'll write content with a specific type of person in mind . Often times , top brands write customer profiles describing and personifying who their audience is . For example , Amanda , 35 , stay-at-home mom , likes playing tennis and cooking . <p> The combination of your niche products with unique content catered to your store visitors will help increase the odds of your customer returning . Customers will keep coming back to your store because they love the style of your products , your product pricing , or that they can find products related to their passion all in one place . <p> Photo : Walmart <h> Niche Offers Flexibility <p> Like mentioned earlier in this article , you 're not limited to a product category .

Your niche might be the style of your clothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way your clothing fits or if your store targets a certain demographic , that could be your niche . <h> Easier to Rank in Search Engines <p> Ranking in search engines for niche keywords is much easier than ranking for general keywords . You 're more likely to rank for the keyword running ' than fitness . ' <p> Furthermore , it 's also easier to rank for niche stores than if you 're trying to build a marketplace . With a niche store , you can use related keywords to rank organically for your niche . However , if you sell a wide assortment of products , you 'd need to rank for a wider range of keywords which likely wo n't be as specific as a niche store . <p> In addition , when creating a niche store , you also have a strong understanding of what type of content your audience would find valuable . For example , if you run an online ballet store , you might build out content related to ballet exercises , preparing for ballet recitals , and ballet costume ideas .

@@12738388 @1338388/ <p> There are many different marketing tactics available to small businesses . You can try content marketing or social media marketing . We 've got your covered on those two topics . You can try traditional advertising as well . However , there is another marketing technique called guerrilla marketing available to you . What is guerrilla marketing ? Well , it 's a budget-friendly option to generate a lot of buzz around your company . Let me tell you a little bit more about it . <h> What is guerrilla marketing ? <p> Guerrilla marketing is a strategy to promote products or services in an unconventional way with a limited budget . The term was coined by Jay Conard Levinson in 1984 . Guerrilla marketing is grabbing the publics attention in a memorable way . Its often very creative . More often than not , its simple . It works best that way . Overthinking does not make for a better guerrilla marketing campaign . Guerrilla marketing is usually an offline method as well . Youd be targeting a specific location that gets a lot of foot traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word about what is happening . This will generate the buzz and get people to talk about you . <h> Pros of guerrilla marketing <p> There are plenty of good reason to use this type of- marketing for small businesses . Its cheap . You can get away with a significantly low budget to conventional marketing and advertising methods . Being cheap to execute is a big part of why so many companies love guerrilla marketing . It also allows for creative expression . Being creative is important in order to make the campaign memorable . Again , you do n't  need to be overly complicated , just impressive enough to grab the attention of the passersby . <p> Guerrilla marketing relies heavily on word of mouth . Word of mouth is one of the most powerful awareness methods . People trust other people albeit it a friend or an influencer . Successful guerrilla marketing gets people to talk about you all on their own . Lastly , a big appeal of guerrilla marketing is its spread . Although not all guerrilla marketing campaigns become news overnight many do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media . Often times , campaigns get talked about on blogs and social media as well . <h> Cons of guerrilla marketing <p> Misunderstood messages . Sometimes guerrilla marketing can backfire . If your message is n't clear enough it might get interpreted as something else . It can not be recognized as yours . And , if people do n't  get it , it will go unnoticed . That 's why its good to keep the campaign creative but simple . Do n't  overcomplicate things . Do n't try to be mysterious or overly clever either . It backfires almost always . <p> Make sure your campaigns are in check with the law . Illegal graffiti or littering will cause you trouble . In 2007 , a guerrilla marketing campaign for Aqua Teen Hunger Force installed LED circuit board around Boston . Many people thought they were bombs and the bomb squad got involved . <p> Small things like bad weather or poor timing can also lead a campaign to fail . <h> Creating a successful guerrilla marketing campaign <p> There are a few thing that will help ensure your campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . Like with most marketing campaigns , start with a goal . What do you want to achieve ? Next , make sure the campaign is easy to understand . If people do n't  get it they wo n't indulge . The campaign also should be social . That 's the big part of getting people to engage or participate after all . And , at last , the campaign needs to be entertaining . People will spread the word like wildfire if they see something fun . <h> Three ideas to get you started <p> Open a popup store . We 've all seen them and some of us even bought products from them . They are these tiny little shops that are easy to set up and take down . The idea here is to bring a point of sale to your potential customers . Accept all sorts of payments . Again , make the purchase easier for your customer . Pay close attention to the way your popup store looks . The presentation is everything . You want to be noticed , not ignored . This is where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store anywhere like a street corner or even inside another store . Often time you can negotiate to set it up for free . Especially if you 're also driving traffic to another business . <p> Use stickers to do your marketing . This is such a common practice in the tech world including software . There are some tech companies who sell products that have stickers too , like Ugmonk . It can work well for an apparel retailer as well . If you have a great logo , flaunt it ! Stickers are cheap . And people love them . You can give them away on the street or industry events . You can make some type of temporary artwork with them too . Use your stickers to spread your message at a specific location . Just make sure you wo n't be violating any laws . Stickers are really easy to remove at the end of the day , though . <p> Use graffiti or posters . Again , I 'm going to caution you about breaking laws . You do n't need to rent space in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these . You could , but it will be expensive . If you have your own office , use that . That 's free . Ask to rent some property for a little bit of time . You can place posters in public board spaces . Doing so in a heavy traffic area could do wonders if your poster is clever and attention-grabbing . <h> Conclusion <p> What is guerrilla marketing ? It 's an easy way to get noticed . Be creative and bold . Guerrilla marketing can be a fantastic tool to generate word of mouth spread of your business . It should be inexpensive too . When done well , people will flock to your business . When done well , people will know your business and want to buy your products .

The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some studies indicate that emails sent within the first 20 minutes of cart abandonment , on average , enjoy a 5.2% conversation rate , whereas emails sent within the first hour achieve a 4.5% conversion rate . We recommend running a few A/B tests to determine the most effective timings for your particular products and customers . <p> It is advisable to send the second email 1-3 days after a cart has been abandoned , and the third email 4-7 days after the cart has been abandoned . The main focus of the third email should be on reminding the customer that their cart wo n't be saved and that it 's likely you 'll run out of stock . Coupon codes is one of the most popular incentives used in the final abandoned cart email as the last attempt to make the customer take action immediately .

Should n't there be an agreement between the two of them ? In my opinion , if these problems regarding closing orders are true , than I do not think that there are people making from 1-25k a day . If they really do , than how do they get pass this issue ? " @qwx196606 <p> That 's why we are introducing our own supplier 's system . We want to offer a more reliable drop shipping business solution and eliminate those additional issues imposed by AliExpress ( issues with products quality + unreliability and closed orders ) . <h> Flavius <p> MantasBeloglavka thank you for your reply , but can you give me more information ?

So that means that i can do , what could have been done with AliExpress . Copying photos of the product and other details . But that also means that I do not have to go , like it was in the case of AliExpress , to the supplier and order that product , waiting for oberlo to complete the process of filling the customer information . <p> I think that you will or already have integrated a system of selecting multiple orders , and just click on " Order " and that will be that .

@@12738392 @1338392/ <h> How can I set up pricing rules ? <p> All products imported to your store from AliExpress imports in their original prices . To make your business profitable , you have to determine and set markups/margins in Oberlo &gt; Settings &gt; Global pricing rules , which will apply to all imported products after clicking Apply pricing rules to existing products . <h> In this article : <h> How do I set my markup/margin price ? <p> Your markups/margins are determined by the Price Multiplier which can be found in your Oberlo &gt; Settings &gt; Global pricing rules page <p> Global Pricing Rules Tab Features <p> Oberlo can either multiply or add a fixed markup to the original AliExpress.com price by the number you set in the Price Multiplier field . <p> Price Multiplier - multiplies the original AliExpress.com price by the number you set in the Price Multiplier field . <p> Fixed Markup - allows you to set a fixed amount that is added on top of your original product price . <p> For example : <p> If you set the price multiplier to 5 , and import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set your retail price at $50.00 . Also , if you set a fixed markup to 5 , then same product 's retail price will be set at $15 . <p> Save to apply pricing rules <p> After you set new pricing rules do n't forget to click the Save Settings button . Your determined pricing rules will be applied to all products which you are going to import . <p> Note , that the Price Multiplier does not update the prices of previously imported products . <p> To update and apply the pricing rules to already existing products , click the Apply pricing rules to existing products option . <p> On a new tab , you can update the type and scope . <p> When ready , click the ' Apply ' button and your product prices will start updating . <p> The number of products left to update does not change automatically . To follow up on how many products are still remaining , just refresh your Global Pricing Rules page and the number will update . <h> How do I set my advanced pricing rules ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markup depending on different cost ranges . <p> For example , if you import four products to Oberlo that cost : a ) $5 b ) $15 c ) $25 d ) $35 . <p> Then the product retail prices in your store would be set as follows : <p> $25 ( $5 multiplied by 5 ) <p> $60 ( $15 multiplied by 4 ) <p> $75 ( $25 multiplied by 3 ) <p> $70 ( $35 multiplied by 2 ) <p> You can also enable a ' Compared at price ' markup in your settings and apply it to different product cost ranges . <h> What are the ' Compared at price ' and ' Assign cents ' features ? <p> Compared at price <p> The product cost determines how much you will charge for products ( and It determines your margins ) . Whereas the compared at price is an advanced pricing technique which when employed creates a strikeout sale price . <p> Note : the compared at price multiplier should always be of greater value than product cost multiplier <p> For example , if you set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , and then import a product that costs $10.00 on AliExpress.com , Oberlo will set your retail price at $20.00 and old retail price/compared price at $30.00 . <p> Assign cents <p> You can set a specific cent value for your retail price . The assign cents menu is located in Oberlo Settings &gt; ' Global pricing rules ' tab . We will use this value when forming the final price for your items . <p> For example , if you want the cost of your product to be XX.99 then add 99 to the fields below :

I was thinking of sending the items to me , inspecting them once arrived , then re shipping them to my customer with my company packaging . I know this will create a longer shipping time . I was going to create a longer processing time , then send a tracking number once I ship it . What do you all think of this process ? <h> Audriusp <p> Regarding custom labeling , you can only try contacting the supplier and ask for a possibility for that . Though , it 's rare and usually happens with big , daily buyers from the same supplier . The only workaround to this would be to send the orders to yourself before sending them to your customer as you mentioned yourself . <p> To save time delivery-wise , you would need to order those products prior to someone ordering from you , though .

All of these 7 tips are geared towards small dropshipping companies . So do n't worry you do n't need to be a marketing wizard or have a huge following . These tips and ideas are here to help you improve your Instagram engagement to grow your company 's visibility and therefore sales . <h> 1 . Host a giveaway <p> The first mention from our top Instagram marketing tips and a great way to increase sales is to give something away . It does n't have to be huge or expensive either . There are a variety of ways you can allow people to enter . They can like your photo , post their own photo and tag you or use a hashtag . They can comment on your photo and tag a friend . Most importantly , ask them to follow your account too in order to be eligible . If you can team up with an influencer that will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip is full of different ideas . <p> That 's what Liquido Active did . They partnered up with Carmen Morgan . Liquido Active sells active yoga clothing . Carmen has a great following on Instagram based on her yoga photos and videos . <p> The giveaway is only for 24 hours . To be eligible , you have to like her photo announcing the giveaway , follow Liquido Active on Instagram and tag a friend in the comment . That 's it . The photo generated over 1,200 comments and over 2,700 in the first two hours of her posting it . <h> 2 . Feature your customers and fans <p> If you have a little bit of a following and a few customers you should start featuring them . Ask your customers in their order confirmation to tag your Instagram account with photos they take with your product . And this can be of anything you 're selling from t-shirts to keychains to socks . You can post photos , or videos , or people using your product in a few different ways . You can run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicate a single day and call it #showoffsunday . You can run a campaign with a specific product and ask for photos of just that one article . <p> You can use this Instagram marketing tip however you 'd like . There are many benefits of featuring photos of your customers . First of all , it will let them know they are cared for . No one wants to feel like they are just an order number . It shows them you respect and appreciate them for having purchased your products . Secondly , it 's social reinforcement for those who have n't bought anything from you yet . It let 's potential customers know that you are selling good products that others enjoy . <p> GoPro 's Instagram is made up mostly of other people 's content . They feature many cute , funny and inspiring shots and video clips . The above is a video of a pirate bungee jumping , aka Collin Harrington . Loyalty towards your customers will go very far . <h> 3 . Get yourself a hashtag <p> Any list of Instagram marketing tips will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instagram go round . You should create one for your brand . It can be a short lived one like for a specific campaign . That 's okay . But you need something that will tie it back to you . Not only that , but your followers will be able to use it too . When they do , it will tie them back to your account . <p> Additionally , do n't forget to use hashtags in your own posts . There is an actual limit of hashtags you can post yourself . It 's 30 . But , that does n't mean you should underutilize them . Use tags that are trending in relation to the products you 're selling . That 's my only word of caution . You should n't be using hashtags for dog accessories if you 're selling shoes . Your content wo n't be noticed because it 's irrelevant . When you 're growing your Instagram account , there is no such thing as too many hashtags . Use them to your advantage . <p> LORNA JANE is currently running two campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two different hashtags : #movenourishbelieve and #activeliving . Both of the hashtags have been tagged in hundreds of thousands posts each . <h> 4 . Find your photography style <p> Instagram is all about aesthetically pleasing photos . Thus one of the most important Instagram marketing tips one could receive is this . Experiment with your style and find what works for your niche . My two favourite examples are Ben &amp; Jerry 's and Chobani . They may be successful companies with a big marketing budget . Do n't let that scare you . There are plenty of people and companies taking great shots with just their phones . <p> Now , Chobani is doing something similar . Right now , it 's fall season and Thanksgiving is approaching in the US . A lot of their photos have to do with Thanksgiving , fall and Halloween theme . The photos are really pretty because they have composure . They are n't filled with all sorts of junk , just a nice photo of a pumpkin and a pumpkin flavored yogurt. <h> 5 . Use Instagram to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less about what to post and more on how to go about your Instagram account to make the best of it . Companies on Instagram see a significantly higher engagement than on either Twitter or Facebook . Your Instagram should have a thoughtful story of your company . Stories compel people to listen and pay attention . When people are listening , it is significantly easier to convert them into paying customers . Stories are an authentic way to set your company apart from others . Through well-defined- content management , your Instagram will keep developing a great story over time . With beautiful- photos of your products , of your company or employees , and of your customers , your story will start to develop . But that 's okay if you keep the content relevant . Your posts need to be cohesive with what your target audience is expecting . This brings me to my next Instagram marketing tip . <h> 6 . Always be testing <p> It 's not easy finding your own style or developing a relevant story but it 's going to be worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something that represents your company and your products well . Second , it should resonate well with your audience . - Which brings me to the 6th Instagram marketing tip : always be testing . You 'll have to run numerous campaigns and post numerous photos in order to get better and better at it . There is no way to know what people end up liking . So , instead of forcing the content on to them , test the waters first . The only way to master something is keep trying . <h> 7 . Use your marketing plan <p> With a marketing plan , you will know how Instagram specifically can help you drive traffic , engagement or sales . But it will also let you see where it falls short too . Instagram is not the answer to all marketing questions . It 's just one of many outlets . And , it works really well for dropshipping companies too . <p> At Oberlo , we have written a bunch of articles explaining how to create marketing plans and content plans . Please read up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be much more successful . A plan will make you set a goal and make sure you post regularly- to achieve it . And of course , goals can be measured .

In this post , we 'll go over some things that make- for a trusted supplier and a few thing that should set off red flags . A lot of our readers and customers choose overseas suppliers . We 'll cover the- use of a directory like AliExpress- in this post too. - By the end , you will have an understanding of what makes for an amazing wholesale supplier and what does n't  . You will feel confident in choosing a wholesale supplier for your business . <h> What are the attributes of legitimate wholesale drop shippers ? <p> There are a lot of attributes associated with legitimate wholesale suppliers . If they are a great and respectful business they will have a reliable customer service team . That 's the most important feature of a great company . A respectable company will have respectable customer service because it 's the face of the company after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get started working together , for instance , because you 're brand new to this . <p> Second , they will be organized and efficient . You do n't want to do business with anyone who is messy and disorganized , who would ? A good supplier knows to deliver any information you requested quickly . They will ship samples to you quickly and include tracking information . The items will be well packaged . The wholesale supplier 's reps will email you back swiftly with all the right pieces of information too . <p> Third , they are the expert in this niche . You can ask them anything and they will provide you with a proper answer without hesitation . They should know the ins and outs of the wholesale business as well as the industry of the products they are selling . You should be able to ask their amazing customer representatives anything about the products they- sell . For example , you can ask how the product compares to another , and receive an answer . If they do n't know the ins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fourth , the supplier should provide you with a data feed . This is important once you start working with them . A data feed will update any- details for the different products and their variations . This way , you do n't have to waste time updating this yourself on regular basis . It will be done automatically . You do n't want to work with a company that does not provide this . <p> The last thing any good wholesale supplier will have is an application . In order to set up an account with the supplier , they will ask you for two main things : your EIN# and reseller certificate . This pertains to US based companies . They will not open an account for you without this information . <h> How to spot a fake wholesale supplier ? <p> Getting scammed is no one 's idea of fun . You do n't know what to look for to spot an illegitimate supplier when you 've never done anything like this . So , I will tell you about three dead giveaways that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across any of these do not contemplate the supplier . Just walk away . It 's tough luck but it 's better than being taken advantage of or stolen from . <p> First , wholesale suppliers never sell to the public directly . That 's the whole idea behind wholesale , after all , B2B . If a potential supplier is selling both wholesale and directly to the public , walk away . <p> Second , they will never have fees to do business with them . This may be in the form of monthly fees or pre-order fees . You will have to walk away from any supplier that wants to charge you for doing any business with them . Their way of making money is to sell you wholesale goods , not through fees . There are plenty of suppliers that do not take advantage of their customers this way . It 's not something you should ever put up with . Period . <p> Third , a legitimate supplier does not publish their prices publically- . Nor will they sell anything to the general public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain prices , you will have to inquire about a quote for whatever items you want to buy from them . They should never have a pricing page or a menu of any kind . Shopify does a great job of explaining what makes for a great RFQ . <h> How to select trustworthy wholesale supplier on AliExpress ? <p> If you 're in the drop shipping business , you will sooner or later end up on AliExpress . It 's an amazing resource to consider when looking for a supplier . While shopping for a supplier on AliExpress , keep in mind how you 'd buy any other product . You want to make sure they have an overall positive rating . It 's easy to trust any supplier with a great rating of 95% or higher . That 's going to be the biggest deciding factor . The more positive reviews the wholesale supplier has , the better they are . That 's kind of a simple but still great starting point . <p> Another thing to watch out for is their shipping turnaround . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's true on AliExpress too . You want the items to be shipped to your customers in a short time frame . That 's why you look for suppliers with ePacket or AliExpress Premium Shipping . It will come with a tracking number for your customer and will take less than 14 days to be delivered to your customers front door . The last thing you want is an angry customer because their item has n't come yet . That 's the worst . <h> Conclusion <p> These are the few things you should be aware of before looking for the right wholesale supplier . There are ups and downs with working with them but if you 're smart and watch out for the things mentioned in this post , you 'll be off to a good start . Nothing beats your own experience , so it 's best just to start and keep learning as you go . You 'll get the hang of it sooner than you think .

Repurposing these well-converting images and learning how to advertise on Instagram on a photo sharing platform feels like a no-brainer move . <p> Experience shows that the success of any online advertising campaign balances on a few factors : how well targeted it is , how naturally it sits with the rest of the content , and how click-enticing it proves to be . <p> One of the most prominent advantages of advertising on Instagram is the opportunity to reach thousands of engaged users without interrupting their browsing experience . Instagram ads appear almost identical to regular posts shared by the platform 's users .

The first step is to simply create a new ad campaign . <h> Choosing your objective <p> When you click to- create a new ad , you should land on this page . <p> As with any other advertising campaign , determining what you want to achieve is crucial . If you 're trying Instagram ads for the first time , my advice would be to keep the objective simple and go with " Send people to your website " . Although you may be tempted to jump straight to lead generation , bear in mind that the process of setting such ads is a bit longer and more complicated . <p> Not all the objectives on the list work with Instagram ads . If your campaign- runs on both Facebook and Instagram , you can choose any of the proposed objectives . If , however , it only targets Instagram users , then you must choose from the following list : <p> Boost your posts <p> Send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Get installs of your app <p> Increase engagement in your app <p> Get video views <p> I 'm going to stick to my own advice and select " Send people to your website " . <p> After selecting the objective , you should be automatically prompted to give your campaign a name . Be sure to include such attributes as date , offer and content to make it easier to identify the campaigns in the future . <h> Choosing your audience <p> If- you 're just starting to learn how to advertise on Instagram , choosing the right audience might be complicated . Practice is the best teacher , so do n't  worry about this too much right now . The most important thing you should keep in mind is what kind of audience would be most in sync with the objective you have selected in the previous step . <p> If you went with " clicks to website " , use your standard buyer- personas to define the audience . Who could be keen on learning more about your products or services ? Alternatively , you can create a Custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . <p> Alternatively , you can create a Custom Audience to show the ad to a particular group of people . <p> As the screenshot suggests , you have four different ways of defining a custom audience . <p> You can upload a file with customer data ( name , surname , email , phone number , zip/postcode , country , year of birth , gender , age , etc ) and create a Custom Audience on Facebook that matches the same criteria . <p> By inserting a piece of JavaScript for your website , you can create a list of people who have already visited your site or specific pages and have taken some kind of action in the past and target them on Instagram . <p> If you have an app , you can create a Custom Audience to reach people who take specific actions in your app , such as reach a certain game level , add items to their cart or rate your app . <p> You can use the data you have on your Facebook followers to create a Custom Audience for Instagram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your videos , b ) opened or completed a lead form in your Lead adverts on Facebook , c ) opened your Canvas on Facebook . <p> Detailed Targeting is a great option too if you know your ideal customers demographics , interests or behaviours . <p> When you complete this step , be sure to save the Audience so you do n't  have to go through the same process next time and can monitor how different audiences respond to your ads . <p> Scroll down to- continue . <h> Selecting the placement <p> The next step is where you get to choose the place where your ads will be shown .

It 's not indexing most of my products and it has been fluctuating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who love SEO and natural organic traffic , submitting a well-structured SITEMAP is really important because over time your sites will rank on google naturally especially your product pages , posts and etc and in turn , you 'll receive organic traffic and sales . I do n't like to heavily rely on Advertising to earn money . I also implement SEO . I have enough patience ! I prefer to do things long term . <p> Shopify 's sitemap is nothing like WordPress . I 've never had issues with my WordPress 's sitemaps and I 've built at least 4 different sites using WordPress/woocommerce and it only takes 2-4 days to start indexing and then 2-3 weeks for all our product pages to get indexed and start ranking on google . Basically , within 2-3 weeks you 'll even see some search queries and you 'll notice your product pages and all other content start to rank on google with a wordpress sitemap <p> I am unfortunately closing the shop from Shopify because they 're not very helpful about the issues with my sitemap . I followed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . <p> It 's a shame because I really love Oberlo . Thomas , please , release the Oberlo woocommerce plugin ASAP so I can continue my dropshipping journey with woocommerce . <p> Thank you ! ! <h> Paulius <p> Hi , Bella ! <p> Thank you so much for such honest feedback about Shopify platform ! <p> We plan to introduce WooCommerce integration , however , I can not give you a clear timeframe when we will release this feature . <h> Bella <p> Paulius Thank you for your reply . How much is the woocommerce version ? Do you think , the woocommerce version will be released this month ? <h> Audriusp <p> Our guys are currently working on the integration and it will be their main focus for the upcoming months . These are two different platforms so it will take more than a couple of months . <p> But we 'll definitely inform everyone once there is more news ! <h> Bella <p> Audriusp Yes , I understand that these are two different platforms ! That 's why we all want to know an expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> aster <p> Bella Hi Bella ! I totally agree with you about WooCommerce vs Shopify . There is a lot of more advantages for WooCommerce than just sitemap . So I do have a woocommerce web-site and I do dropshipping without oberlo there . It is a little bit more work there but it is not so difficult ( it depends on how many products do you plan to have ) . There I have around 20 products so I added them manualy ... <p> But the most interesting part about Oberlo is their new Supply platform . And without shopify it ca n't work unfortunately . When the WooCommerce version of oberlo will be released I will move all my web-site on WP immediately <h> Bella <p> aster Hi aster , thank you for your reply . I 'm in love with Oberlo 's plugin but not with Shopify 's implementation . Never again , I 'll create another store with shopify . Their basic SEO and sitemaps are really frustrating . You 'll never gain lots of organic traffic if you use Shopify longterm . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic traffic with their shopify store . <p> Anyway , how are you going with your dropshipping with woocommerce ? And how are you dealing with manual fulfillment ? <p> Thanks @qwx196606 <p> The main reason why we ca n't give an ETA is because we are currently going through the planning phase for the WooCommerce implementation . <p> There are a lot of things WooCommerce does differently from Shopify ( i.e. orders fulfillment ) . We have to figure everything out first in order to give you a proper ETA rather than throwing out presumption based deadline which may create false expectations and promises upon which we ca n't deliver . <p> I do understand the urgency , and I wish myself to get it implemented faster . The only thing I can promise is to get you all notified as soon as we get concrete information from our product managers . <h> aster <p> Bella I just manually fulfill all my orders ... as I said , I have only 20 products and it is not so complicated to add each product manually on my web-site and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ... Traffic comes from advertising on instagram and facebook. i have n't done SEO because the products that I sell is something that a user will never search on google . They will buy only if they see an ad somewhere .

BUT i am also experiencing all the negatives that comes with it .. my recent issue is my worst fear from the start and it has to do with PAYPAL ... as over 80% of my customers choose paypal express to pay instead of using a credit/debit card . Ita great and convinient but i fear the worst sometime . So i wonder how the guys with big successful store have handled the paypal situation with dropshipping customers . <p> a few weeks ago they put a 21 day hold on any funds i receive ( I had this account since 2005 and no problems at all when i was selling on ebay ) . <p> - with the increase in orders , came an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagged . <p> the past two days i had a message from a customer saying they tried to pay with paypal but he received a message that " there is no shipping methods available for your cart or destination " which is complete bullshit because i ship to every country on my store except south america and africa .. and never had a problem sending to that region before . <p> today i got a message from a customer saying they just realized that a payment they made with paypal wasnt accepted by paypal . <p> I should let you know that i have had 6 disputes from customers because they claim to not receiv their items . I just took another loss yesterday giving a refund to another customer . So it is starting to be a problem for me <p> i am wondering now if paypal will deny transactions and block shipping to certain regions without notifying the account holder ? <p> I heard the horror stories of people getting their accounts frozen with hundreds of thousands of dollars in it . Which means that you are pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dead account ... this is my biggest fear when i start scaling up . <p> - how do you manage to keep your account good with multiple customer disputes ? <h> ASP <p> is the buyer from a country paypal operates in i know some countries are off limits with paypal <p> also with paypal express i was getting lots and lots of problems because the express button is on the first page of checkout which is before shipping details so i removed it and now abandonment and problems have dropped a bit <p> and yes the more you sell the more hassle paypal becomes i sold $2k once to a customer all legit and they almost closed me down lol

We recommend using a dedicated ecommerce platform to create your store . <p> The two most popular ecommerce platforms which are used to create and manage stores are Shopify and WooCommerce .

You can also customize these themes to fit your ecommerce store 's style , which is great for making your online store stand out from the crowd . <p> WooCommerce does n't yet have a theme store incorporated into their WordPress plug-in .

@@12738446 @1338446/ <h> What is B2B eCommerce ? <p> Business to business eCommerce , or B2B eCommerce , is an online business model that refers to business transactions between two businesses , rather than transactions between a company and individual consumers .

@@12738453 @1338453/ <p> As dropshippers , your business is dependent on Chinese dropshipping suppliers . There have been many rumors swirling around about how Chinese New Year will affect your store . Some claim that you wo n't be able to sell products for three months . The good news is that most of the rumors you 've read are n't even close to true . We 've contacted suppliers on AliExpress to find out the truth about the new year shutdown . <p> Chinese New Year 2017 will take place on Saturday , January 28 this year . On average , suppliers take a week off to spend time with their family and friends . This is comparable to people taking extra time off during the holiday season ( Christmas and New Years ) in North America . <p> Just as you might have a couple of weeks off work during the holidays , some suppliers might choose to extend their holiday a week earlier or later . They 'll likely start slowing down production before their weeklong holiday . Thus , it 's important to contact each supplier you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shutting down and starting up again . Also , it 's good to know dates so that you can slow down your ads during the period . <h> How Long Does It Take for Products to Ship during Chinese New Year ? <p> Prior to Chinese New Year , some suppliers might slow down production a week or two in advance . Thus , orders received a week or two before the actual date might be delayed . In addition , orders received during the week of Chinese New Year will experience delays too . <p> There are a few factors that influence the ship time for the products . You 'll need to contact the suppliers you work with the most to get specific information . Ask each supplier when they 'll stop processing orders and when they 'll start again . Also , if you 're using ePacket ship times will be faster than if you use standard shipping . <p> Importantly , some suppliers might not even be based in China . As non-Chinese suppliers would n't celebrate the holiday , there might not be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Should I Close My Store for Chinese New Year ? <p> No . There 's no need to close your store during Chinese New Year . Some blogs and Facebook groups will dramatize delays during Chinese New Year . <p> On average , suppliers take a week or two off . Will Chinese New Year affect your store ? Yes , but only for a couple of weeks at most . <p> What are the best selling products on your store ? Contact the suppliers that make your best selling products to find out exactly how long they 'll be off for . Once you have this information , you can decide how to proceed with your store . <p> For example , if a supplier for a popular necklace is going to take a month off , you might want to hide that product on your store temporarily . If a supplier for a popular shirt is taking a week off , you might choose to spend less on ads temporarily . <p> In general , if a supplier plans on taking more than a couple of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two before the dates they 'll be closed to prevent delays . <p> Another important reason why you should n't close your store during Chinese New Year is you 're going to scare your customers . Imagine ordering from a store and a week later the store closes . Customers who have n't received their order yet will freak out . <p> It 's important to stay active on social media , answer emails and keep your store up . <h> Which Niches Will be Most Affected by Chinese New Year ? <p> When it come to which niches Chinese New Year affects the most it 's typically those in late January or early February . For example , if you sell lingerie , orders might not arrive in time for Valentine 's Day . If you sell masks , you might miss out on Mardi Gras sales depending on the year . <p> Some customers may be concerned when their package is delayed . However , there are a few extra steps that your business can take to maintain the customer 's peace of mind . <p> First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur during Chinese New Year . If you do n't want your customers to know that your products are from China you can list dates instead . For example , There may be shipping delays between date-date . ' You might want to have a sticky bar banner on your website that states this . You might also want to place it on product pages that you send your ad traffic to . <p> Second , remind your customers via email of delays as soon as they place their orders . Having automated emails sent out informing them of delays ensures that they get the message in case they missed it on your website . Also , it 's great for reassurance when they realize the order has n't arrived yet a couple weeks later . <p> Third , respond to all customer inquiries . You might have a few upset customers if their package is delayed . However , be kind and patient when responding to them . Aim to respond to all messages within 24 hours so customers can be reassured that their package will be arriving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every package that 's being shipped during that period . If you notice a couple items have n't been shipped around that time , be aware that certain customers may contact you . You can even take the initiative to let them know of any delays . Sometimes it 's better to be proactive than reactive . <p> Lastly , place your orders on time . By placing AliExpress orders within the same day and having cut off deadlines for certain products for Chinese New Year you help prevent any upcoming issues . Follow your suppliers ' timeframes to ensure your customers receive their products on time . <h> How to Keep Your Store Afloat During Chinese New Year <p> As a store owner , you 'll experience a slight hiccup for a couple of weeks during Chinese New Year . To keep your business profitable during that period , you 'll need to make some slight adjustments . <p> First , spend less on ads . Now is not the time to scale . As soon as your suppliers come back from their holiday , you can scale your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure , you 'll have fewer orders but at least you 'll have fewer refunds to worry about . Also , focus your ads on products from suppliers who will only be off for a week . If a supplier will be off for a month , avoid promoting their products temporarily . You can also focus on sending traffic to non-Chinese suppliers who do n't celebrate the holiday . <p> Second , if your store also sells print on demand products , you should focus on those products temporarily . This will allow you to keep making money on your store during the Chinese New Year holiday . <p> Third , continue your marketing efforts . While you might spend less on advertising , you should still continue posting on social media multiple times a day , blogging regularly and other activities to keep your brand at the top of mind . This helps reassure customers who 've already ordered while also building relationships with potential customers . <p> Lastly , keep money in your store 's bank account . You should always have money in your bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week or two , you should still be able to pay all of your monthly expenses with savings in your account . Do n't spend every dollar you make . <h> When does business go back to normal after Chinese New Year ? <p> Business will go back to normal about a week or two after Chinese New Year for most suppliers . Some suppliers might be off a bit longer but it depends on each one . You 'll need to contact your suppliers directly to find out more information . <p> Keep in mind , since Chinese suppliers were off for at least a week , they 'll have a backlog of orders they need to get to first which delays things a bit for them . You 'll want to keep an eye on orders and keep customers informed throughout the process . <p> Have any other questions about how Chinese New Year will affect your store ?

Hope things are going smoothly with your store ! <p> jfreemom <p> Great article Nicole . I was worried being a new dropshipper about the Chinese New Year because of the horror stories I heard about them being off for at least a month , etc .. Glad to know that this is not true for most suppliers from China ! <p> Nicole <p> Thanks ! I was worried too when I first heard about it . Then , I contacted my main suppliers and they all said the complete opposite of what everyone else was saying online . There 's a lot of misinformation around . There may be the odd supplier who is off a bit longer than expected but its not the case for the majority . Contact your suppliers to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically and make adjustments accordingly . Hope things run smoothly for your store during that period ! <p> Alex <p> Hi Nicole , I have a store that made sales using google adwords but not are consistent a keyword can have a conversion of 3 % , and others pass 2 days and ni one sale . <p> I have tested fb ads too , I can get cheap clicks around 0.15 0.2 usd but I do n't  have much lucky i had 1 abandonment cart . <p> The problem is that my sales and conversion rate is very low yesterday I had 124 visit and only 1 sale . ( profit is only 20 USD , . and with upsell i can made 50 usd ) <p> The time per sesion of each user is around 1 minute 30 s and some people spend around 7 -8 minutes watching my video testimonials <p> What can be my mistake ? I understand that fb ads can be a little more difficult but in adwords is people that search my product <p> Dennis <p> Now that I know when my suppliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is delayed also . Are packages still accepted and shipped to the US , or is that delayed also because those shipping employees are on Holiday also ? <p> Nicole <p> How much do you spend on ads per day ? How many different products have you run ads to ? What type of Facebook ads are you using ? Are you retargeting customers ? <p> Nicole <p> Hey Dennis , looking into this for you . I 'll get back to you as soon as I hear back . <p> Alex <p> I spend around 15 USD per day ( CPC average of 0.2 0.3 ) in total around 300 USD . I use WC view content with a video ads . Yep I use retargeting in FB and Adwords <p> Dennis <p> Awesome , thank you ! <p> Nicole <p> Hey Alex , on average if I 've been running an ad and its hit $100 or has been running for 5 days without a sale , I usually try a different product . With my store , I 'm constantly testing different products in my ads . I normally do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant give advice about that . However , if you 've spent $300 and only got one sale , its time to test another product . If your budget is about $15 a day , I 'd split that into three different ads for three different products to see which one gets traction . Once you get an ad that converts well with the small budget you can start increasing it . Sometimes the successful ad , on FB , breaks as it needs to reoptimize so I 'd recommend running the ad for 3-5 days to let it readjust with the new settings . <p> Alex <p> Thanks for your reply Nicole , that mean that is a bad product ? In Amazon for example is a product with high sales around 2k-4k units per month so i do n't  understand what can be the problem . <p> Adwords is making some sales and fb 0 . <p> What is the conversion rate " standard " in your experience using retargeting ? <p> How many times a user must visit your website " using retargeting " to convert them in buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I learned a lot . Should you also ask suppliers when the last day to put a order through is , so that the product ships before cny shuts things down ? <p> Alberto Guidotti <p> Nice article , Thanks ! <p> Nicole <p> Hey Dennis , theyll be closed for a week . However , there will be delays for a couple weeks after that as there will be a backlog . <p> Nicole <p> Hey Shaker , you can contact them for when to put your last order in . However , I feel like you might get vague answers because they likely wont want you to stop putting orders in . For the most part a week or two before the holiday they start slowing down . Yet , you can ask to double check <p> Nicole <p> It does n't  mean its not a bad product . It might mean its not an impulse buy product . For example , if you got an ad on FB for bandaids would you feel compelled to buy it right now ? Probably not . Some products get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their credit card to make a purchase right away . Its about finding those products and putting them in front of people . People do n't  usually go on FB to buy products so you have to have something that would convince people to buy then . <p> If Adwords is working for you , then you should keep playing with and testing your ads on it to keep growing it . <p> We have multiple retargeting ads . Our most successful retargeting ad retargets our blog traffic . It only converts at 1.53% however , its highly profitable bringing in more than 3x the revenue . <p> The last question is kind of tricky . I might write a retargeting article and explore it further for you by testing some more variables . <p> Nicole <p> Thanks Alberto ! Hope everythings going well with your store ! <p> Alex <p> Thanks Nicole to reply all my questions . Today I have 100 visitors again but not much luck only 1 person with interest in a coupon . Do you know someone that have experience and can checking my campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can pay for the help <p> Shaker <p> Thanks . Makes sense . So how are you going to be handling your store for that time frame ? Are you just going to slow down ads and put up a notice saying shipping is going to be slow from this date to this date ? <p> Thomas Straetmans <p> Hey Nicole , I 'm new to dropshipping and was just wondering . Is there a way to find suppliers outside of China specifically on Aliexpress ? I cant seem to filter on the suppliers location like you can on Alibaba . Thanks ! <p> Nicole <p> Hey Shaker , <p> Ill be slowing down ads during this time . Ill also be setting auto responder emails saying there will be delays . Our website will also mention this . <p> Lydia Pflieger <p> This is great information ! I was concerned about how CNY would affect my fledgling store . Thanks for the info ! <p> Sorry for the delay . Ive been asking around for this as I thought there was a way to do this easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though I know you can choose where it ships from as some ship from the US . <p> Alex <p> Thanks for the page . But Is the same that you can find in youtube videos or others . I need can know exactly what can be my fail . Because honestly is a little frustrating be stuck and know what is wrong <p> Do you drive your traffic to <p> -Product page ? -Collection ? -Blog Article ? <p> That are the 3 strategy that i have see in others persons . and 90 % talking about benefits of her product ( in a article or in a video ) <p> For my store , I drive traffic to specific product pages and blog posts . I 'm going to write an article about retargeting and answer everything you need to know about it . If you have more questions about retargeting let me know and I 'll include it in the article . Ill share everything I do on my store in it too so you can see what works and what does n't  . <p> Justin Wong <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicole <p> It depends . One of my suppliers is n't taking the holiday off so well still be ordering through them . Another one of our suppliers is taking 3 weeks off . Focus on directing traffic to the products thatll be available . You still want to mention that there will be delays as China Post will still take the week off . 
@@12738457 @1338457/ <h> How long before opening an Aliexpress Dispute ? <h> Lorenzo <p> Hey all , <p> I had a customer place an order on 7th December , I placed the order via ePacket on the same day for delivery to the US . Tracking has n't updated since 9th December and tracking does n't say its reached the US at all . <p> I messaged the supplier to ask what 's up , and their response blamed it on snow delays in the US , working through a large backlog . Understandable , but I find it a little hard to believe it would be that long . <p> I have since pressed again , asking for a refund or replacement but they keep using the same excuse . <p> Since the on-time delivery promise was 45 days , does anyone have any information about what Aliexpress disputes consist of ? They are one of my top suppliers so I 'd rather keep things civil . <h> Vince <p> Lorenzo ePacket should only be about 30 days max . I know they usually claim 12-20 days but in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of purchase , so I just round it up to 30 days when I tell the customers . When sending out tracking numbers ( with tracking link ) , I just indicate 15-30 days on average as it is FREE STANDARD SHIPPING , this way the customers have an idea of how long it 's going to be . It helps cut down on future inquiries , and in most cases with the products I 'm selling , it hardly ever goes beyond the 30 day time frame for ePacket ( US/UK/AU ) . <p> Now , on the suppliers ' side of things , if it has passed the date it was supposed to arrive and they did n't extend buyer protection , you should file the dispute . If they offer the extension days prior to the original expiration , give them that time frame before filing your dispute . <p> Disputes are fairly easy . You just enter the reason and choose either refund ( partial or full ) or replacement . If it 's shipping matters , choose that option and explain that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to respond and AliExpress will arrive at their decision within a week or so . If it 's a dispute for a defective product , make sure you ask for several photos of the item from your customer first and use these photos as your own proof in your dispute with your supplier . <p> For the most part , AliExpress has been reasonably fair with their decisions with my disputes . I try not to file too much though as they may notice a pattern and that could mean a shut down of my AliExpress account . If it 's a cheap item but you 're selling a lot of it , I think you 're just going to have to take a loss once in a while for it . I think it 's all part of this business . It sucks , but you learn to work through these things individually as time goes on . <h> Thimxo <p> Same issue here .

@@12738461 @1338461/ <p> I always see new entrepreneurs on forums asking others the same question . Hey , can you please give me feedback on my store ? ' They ask not realizing that their competitors are in the same group . Getting online store feedback is important as you 'll need to ensure that your website is presentable for potential customers . However , who you ask for the feedback is crucial in the success of your business . Here 's a general overview of who to contact and what I look for to provide myself feedback on my store : <p> Before asking for feedback on my store , the first thing I do is ensure that my website is complete . I ensure that shipping information is available for customers to read . Since shipping times tend to be longer than expected , it 's important to have that information easily accessible in the footer of the website . <p> Next , I look over my Returns and Refunds page and double check the content of the information . Afterwards , I 'll look over my About Us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images to better create a human connection . Then , I ensure that the Contact Us page has several ways for a customer to contact me . I add a live chat app . I double check to ensure that the email address is working . <p> Lastly , I do one final proofread of the website . I ensure there are n't any spelling or grammatical mistakes . <h> 2 . Feedback On My Store How to have a perfect product page <p> Your product pages have to be perfect . Why ? Your product pages will likely be the landing pages for your ads . They need to be optimized to help convert the sale . <p> When importing products to your store , ensure that the product images are high quality . If the store number or brand name is written on top of the model , do n't import the product . Find another supplier or another image instead . If the logo is on the top corner and does n't interfere with the product image , remove it in Photoshop , Canva or Paint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up the brand and realize that they can buy it more affordably on AliExpress . <p> A big mistake many make with their copy is that they import the bullet points provided from AliExpress without making adjustments . Many of the bullet points can be removed . Also , you might want to stick with a consistent format . For example , you might want fabric information listed first for all product pages . Next , having a couple of sentences describing the product will also help convert the sale . Oberlo does n't import product descriptions so you 'll need to write your own . Keep the copy consistent with your brand . For example , if you sell funny t-shirts you might have funny copy to go with it . <p> On your product page , having a countdown timer will help encourage conversions . On one of my stores , we temporarily removed the timer and our sales drastically decreased . Personally , I use Hurrify Countdown Timer on my store , but you can choose the one that works best for you . <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or money back guarantee . What does your store offer customers that you want to highlight ? Create a badge for it and add it to your product page . <h> 3 . Online Store Feedback Does Your Product Selection Make Sense ? <p> When I first started creating stores in 2013 , I made an epic product selection mistake . I did n't focus on one niche . When I asked people for feedback on my store , they told me to start with one focus and grow into categories that make sense . For example , if you sell women 's apparel , selling furniture or electronics on your store does n't make sense . However , if you sell women 's apparel , you can eventually expand into jewelry , shoes , and handbags . <p> When it comes to product organization , there most common mistake I see from people asking for online store feedback is that the product categories are n't specific . For example , they 'll have categories called women 's or men 's . In the women 's category , all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to browse through an unorganized women 's category can be overwhelming . Thus , having specific categories like dresses , blouses , skirts , etc , under a women 's category tend to be easier to browse through . <p> A great benefit to Oberlo is that you can view the order volume and product reviews for each AliExpress product . Thus , if you choose products with high order volume and positive reviews then your product selection will be validated . When starting out , stick to the best sellers . <h> 4 . Feedback On My Store Are you marketing your store ? <p> Typically people ask for a new store critique when they launch their store and do n't get sales right away . As an experienced marketer , I tend to get sales from day one . However , if you do n't have a background in marketing , you might need to sign up for an online course to learn how to market your store . <p> You 'll need to experiment with Facebook ads . Most people do n't create their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different copy . They test different audiences . To succeed with Facebook ads , you need to create several ads before you start creating a sustainable business . You can start by creating several $5 ads to determine your best products . Then , once you 've narrowed down your best-sellers , you can start tweaking the demographics to maximize your ad spend . Do n't give up on a niche after one failed ad . <p> If you struggle to get any sales with Facebook Ads , then you should try Instagram influencer marketing . You can also check out Snapchat or YouTube . However , even with influencer marketing , you 'll need to experiment . There are some influencers who are n't good at converting customers . For example , if an influencer is posting products too often their audience may become exhausted . It takes time finding influencers that convert well . <p> In addition , you should also be focused on building a social following . If your website links to a social media , and you have no posts or followers , potential customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two options . First , you can grow your social media following with Facebook and Instagram Ads to grow your number of followers . Second , you can only put the link to your social media after you 've grown a small following such as 500+ followers . <h> 5 . Online Store Feedback Other ecommerce store feedback ideas <p> Before I get feedback on my store , I check both desktop and mobile versions of my website . Sometimes , a popup looks great on desktop but is annoying on mobile . Other times , a banner looks great on mobile but looks bad on desktop . Checking both will give you insight on what needs to be fixed . <p> Next , a big mistake inexperienced store owners do is pick a bad store name . I often see new store owners naming their store after popular brands . For example , naming your store after another brand but tacking on store , shop , fashion or other word is going to get you in trouble . If the name is trademarked , you 'll get sued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's bad for branding and SEO . Take the time to come up with a unique brand name . <p> Also , limit the pop-ups on your homepage . Most find pop-ups annoying . Having one pop-up can be effective for collecting email addresses or calling attention to a sale . However , having multiple popups all at once will likely result in potential customers bouncing off your website , especially on mobile . For example , if you use the FOMO Shopify app , do n't use an email pop-up . You should also avoid themes with too much movement where the text and images popup as you scroll . <h> 6 . Where to get feedback on my store <p> One of my favorite website 's to get feedback on my store is Peek User Testing . They offer a free five minute video review of your online store .

The review will be an hour long so you 'll definitely get a lot of tactical information you can apply right away . Here 's a sample website feedback review video : <p> Another option is to ask other entrepreneurs in Facebook groups for feedback on your store .

In short : online marketing for small business is something you should master before you launch your small eCommerce store ! <p> Online marketing has repeatedly been proven to be the most cost-effective and far-reaching type of advertising in the 21st century . As such , it 's a no-brainer for your eCommerce store . Small online businesses do n't have the resources or endless manpower to engage in lengthy and complicated marketing campaigns .

For instance , you can install the good , old Hello Bar right on your site , so that this bar drops down across the entire length of your homepage , always reminding your visitors to sign up to your newsletters ! <p> Similarly , you can use an opt-in form popup like Optin Monster to capture the email addresses of your visitors . <h> Generate more product reviews for your online store <p> At the end of the day , social proof is still a very powerful form of psychological persuasion to help convert your visitors .

If using the oberlo app you can add your own personal debit or credit card and it will automatically order the item from the Aliexpress supplier on your behalf . I have heard of people using a credit card with a huge balance and using that as the main card you buy the items from the suppliers with and also heard of people waiting for payment from shopify before ordering the item from the Aliexpress supplier . I originally had paypal as my payment gateway until i remembered how shitty they are in terms of holding onto money for stupid amounts of time . I then decided to use shopify 's payment gateway " Stripe " in the hope that i would receive the cash from them sooner than paypal . How are other people handling this issue ? are you guys using a credit card to buy items from aliexpress individually/manually or letting oberlo do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see arising is me getting a credit card slapping it on oberlo and as if by luck i get a sequence of orders and boom the card has reached its limit and i 'm still waiting for the payment gateway to give me my cash which would leave in a catch 22 with no cash to buy more products and no ability to apply for yet another credit card . Now i know that getting and influx of orders to the point your credit card reaches its limit is very rare but can happen . <h> Vince <p> Hi JeffroBenBulman I 'm not sure if I understood your question correctly but it sounds like you 're thinking that Oberlo requires you to give them your credit/debit card in order for them ( Oberlo ) to buy your items for you on AliExpress ? <p> To my knowledge , Oberlo does not directly buy your item for you , and Oberlo does n't require that you provide the card you 're using as your working capital within their application , rather they simply automate your payments WITHIN AliExpress after you place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your purchase credit card inside AliExpress and you 're triggering the payments through Oberlo . <p> Stripe/Shopify/PayPal payment gateways are " separate " in a sense . You 're receiving payments from customers through Shopify/Stripe/PayPal . That money can then be transferred to your bank account . You can use that same money to make your purchases on AliExpress , or you can use an entirely different card that you 'd have to enter into AliExpress to make your buys . <p> Hopefully that clears it up a bit .

@@12738480 @1338480/ <h> How do you handle AliExpress dropshipping returns and refunds ? <h> Steve921 @qwx196609 <p> An easy refunds and returns policy is one of the competitive advantages you can offer . But be aware , this part is the most tricky one . <p> Returns : <p> AliExpress suppliers rarely agree to accept returns and even if they do accept them , you do n't usually get notified when they receive it and the refund is down to you . From my experience , I suggest you accept the returns to your office and if the product is not spoiled or used , reship it later from your own destination . <p> It will be simpler for your customers and you 'll offer better customer support . <p> If your store communicates the relevant information about product features and delivery terms , your returns rate should average to 6-8% . <p> Refunds : <p> The two most frequent scenarios : <p> the order is not shipped or is extremely late ; <p> the customer picked the wrong product or is not happy with the product quality . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accept it to your office/warehouse , and if it was a quality issue , cover the return costs and issue a refund . If your customer picked the wrong product/does n't want the product anymore , covering the returns costs is optional ; just issue the refund . <p> In the first scenario , it 's unlikely to get a refund from the AliExpress seller and then issue the refund from your balance to your customer . You 'll cover the refund yourself . <p> AliExpress sellers are opposed to issuing a refund . They will keep claiming that the order is shipped or eventually offer a reshipment . <p> The risks increase when you 're doing more sales . Try to arrange a refund agreement with your supplier in the beginning because blind dropshipping can cause serious problems . <p> How to avoid ? Try to be strict and persistent , if the supplier refuses to refund you even if there 's an acceptable reason for return ( the package was never delivered or the orders tracking status is pending for 30 days ) , apply for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Bombard him/her with the bad reviews . <p> Changing an AliExpress supplier 's account is n't easy , and they value their source of revenue a lot . <p> Try not to get to the point when you order is n't delivered , the tracking code is inactive , 50 days has passed , and your customer is now angry . <p> Fun fact : I made one supplier send a photo of every package they shipped for me . They literally took pictures of every single order they shipped , for months ! <h> rjlarge <p> Bummer , I knew it would happen sooner or later : - ( I went 89 orders before I had any trouble or requests for a refund ........ Lady ordered 3 items . 2 Items were poorly made and the other was just the wrong item . Needless to say she was pissed and demanded a full refund right way , which I did .

@@12738489 @1338489/ <p> When you 're starting an eCommerce business , you also need to determine how to acquire the products you want to sell . Two common methods of acquiring product inventory are dropshipping and wholesaling . But the question arises , dropshipping vs wholesale ? Which is better ? <p> Once you start your own business , the myriad of decisions you have to make to get off the ground can feel daunting . What web hosting provider will you use ? What will your first blog post be about ? How will you reach your customers by optimizing your site ? <p> It 's important to understand differences between these methods in order to make the right choice for your business , so we 'll break it down for you here . <h> Dropshipping vs wholesale : what 's the difference ? <p> Dropshipping and wholesaling are two different supply chain management methods that help eCommerce businesses fulfill orders and get products to their customers . They 're both options for businesses that do n't want to manufacture their own product , but they 're different in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of buying product inventory at a discounted rate from the manufacturer and selling it at a higher price to customers . Wholesaling is a good option for new eCommerce business owners because it 's easy : the products are already being manufactured and sold , so business owners can buy quantities of what they 're selling in their eCommerce stores and manage order fulfillment and shipping to customers directly . <p> Pros <p> When business owners buy products wholesale , they 're purchasing an inventory that is already manufactured and sold successfully ( otherwise , the wholesaler would n't make the product ) . This minimizes risk associated with purchasing quantities of the product for the eCommerce business owner 's inventory if customers already purchase it from other sellers , they 're likely to purchase it from another eCommerce store as well . <p> The business owner can control product inventory by purchasing product from a wholesaler to keep up with customer demand . Having the product in stock and under the store 's control means they can better communicate quantities and fulfill orders faster for customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their product it 's determined by the manufacturer or wholesaler . <p> If an eCommerce store owner sells a variety of different products , they will have to work with multiple wholesale partners to fulfill customer orders , which can be hard to manage and keep organized . <p> When purchasing inventory wholesale , business owners must typically purchase large quantities of product and store it until it 's sold to customers . This requires a business premises that 's large enough to and capabilities to ship orders , which can be costly and require up-front investment when you first launch your business . <p> Margins and risks <p> According to Shopify , it 's possible to see up to a 50% margin on wholesale products sold by retailers , and they might be slightly higher than dropshipping but lower than manufacturing . <p> The biggest risk of purchasing products wholesale is the lack of guarantee : There 's a risk that the business owner might not be able to sell the entire inventory , and there 's a risk that the seller wo n't be able to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Examples of wholesalers <p> The Lodge is an example of an eCommerce store that purchases men 's clothing and accessories from wholesalers and sells items at retail prices to customers . Costco Wholesale 's online store is another example of an eCommerce store that sells a variety of wholesale goods at lower prices for their customers . <h> Dropshipping <p> Dropshipping is the process of selling products to customers without having an inventory . The dropshipping supplier fulfills customer orders and sends product to them , and the eCommerce store owner profits by charging customers at a higher rate than the dropshipper charges them for their service . <p> Pros <p> With dropshipping , business owners do n't have to purchase large inventories of product . Instead , they 're only buying the product that their customers have ordered . This minimizes risk of losing money on unsold inventory for the business owner . <p> When you compare dropshipping vs wholesale , dropshipping looks like- a great choice for first-time entrepreneurs because startup costs are low : eCommerce store owners only purchase the product their customers have purchased versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnaround for return on investment and profit generation . <p> Business owners do n't have to manage the processing and shipping of orders that is handled by the dropshipping company , which further cuts down on costs and requires less work for the eCommerce store owner . <p> Cons <p> When business owners purchase product from dropshipping companies , they achieve smaller profit margins than with purchasing product wholesale because the dropshipping partner assumes order processing and shipping costs . <p> Margins and risks <p> Profit margins are the difference between what business owners charge customers and what they pay their dropshipper . The low upfront costs of using a dropshipping supplier eats into the profit margins , which typically hover around 20% . <p> The risk of choosing dropshipping vs wholesale is that store owners wo n't sell enough product to generate enough profit to compensate for the lower margins , but with a diverse database of products to choose from and commitment to marketing , business owners can generate buzz and engagement . <p> Examples of dropshippers <p> One of the most well-known examples of a business that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship many orders from their warehouses , products sold by third-party vendors are processed and shipped by external dropshippers . Another example is Zappos , who sells shoes to customers once they 're purchased from a dropshipping partner . <p> Once you 've decided which method is right for you and your business , you 're ready to select reliable company you could trust .

One feature that 's distinctive compared to other dropshipping database competitors are their Market Research Labs , which allows users to find potentially lucrative customer niches they can market and sell to . <p> Pros <p> SaleHoo is somewhat affordable , with subscriptions ranging between $27 and$97 per month in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by SaleHoo analysts , and with their 60-day money back guarantee , business owners can be confident in the product they 're purchasing from the database . <p> Cons <p> SaleHoo has limited resources for customer education : Their content marketing strategy is n't as built out as their competitors , and their site offers customers fewer free tools to educate themselves . <p> The affordable price reflects that the database is n't as large as other dropshipping databases , such as AliExpress , the world 's largest online B2B marketplace with over 200 million items businesses can dropship . This size limits eCommerce store owners in terms of variety and pricing of products they can offer customers . <p> Some product prices are high and potentially unable to compete against other prices on major reselling sites , such as Amazon or eBay . <h> Dropshipping vs wholesale : Worldwide Brands review <p> Worldwide Brands was founded in 1999 and offers a similar service to its competitors above : it 's a directory of products eCommerce store owners can purchase from wholesalers and manufacturers . Worldwide Brands is geared toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with that comes higher membership and product prices . It 's a worthwhile investment for customers looking for a wide variety of options and helpful support for the lifetime of their business . <p> Pros <p> Worldwide Brands has a large directory on the market , and the sellers and distributors are all certified by the company to ensure a quality experience for their customers . <p> Although the membership fee is steep ( $299 as of October 2016 ) , it 's a lifetime membership , so it can repay itself depending on the level of success an eCommerce store experiences . <p> Cons <p> The up-front cost of Worldwide Brands is higher than its competitors , and if customers are n't working to access customers and fulfill orders efficiently , they may not see a rapid return on investment . <p> There are extra Worldwide Brands services that are sold to users and billed separately from the membership fee , which are additional high costs . <p> Membership is n't the perfect fit for first-time eCommerce business owners who may need additional time , resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and running . <h> Dropshipping vs wholesale : why Oberlo ? <p> Import hundreds of products to your store in minutes . <p> The most important thing when starting a new business is to secure a supplier so you can start connecting with your customers and meeting their needs .

It 's essential that you come up with a memorable name for your online store something which is going to catch the eyes of your audience and leave a lasting impression . Make sure that the name is related to your niche , and something which you 'll be able to build a marketing strategy around . <p> Coming up with an idea for the name of your ecommerce business which will stand the test of time can be tricky . Check out some of your competitors and analyze the types of names which they use . Make a note of the ecommerce business names which you like and then think about how your idea compares with it . Does your idea stand out from the crowd ? If not , what can you do to make it unique ? Registering a Business Name <p> Once you 've come up with an amazing name for your ecommerce business you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business . It 's critical to make sure that your business name is n't already registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) . The USPTO will automatically reject any registration for a business name that 's already registered in their system . You 'll also lose any processing fees from the application . <p> To avoid any of these problems , research your local business directories to verify if the business name you 'd like to use is available . You can also use USPTO 's free tool to check if your business name is available . <p> Future-Proofing Your Business Name <p> When you 've found a memorable business name that is available , take some time to think about the long-term goals of your business . Do you think that the name of your business is future-proof ? Will it stand the test of time ? <p> Try to avoid choosing a business name which stems from a current trend . If you were to name your ecommerce business Selfie Stick Corporation ' you may see success initially , but how popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's important to consider the staying-power of a name before you register your business , as it 'll be inconvenient to change your name later on . Changing your name once you 've created an established ecommerce business is a hassle legally , and can also lead to confusion for your existing customers . <h> Picking Your Business Entity <p> After you 've decided on a name for your ecommerce business , you 'll need to choose the type of business entity which best fits your online store . There are two main options ; registering your business as an LLC , or incorporation . There are distinct differences between these two options , so we 've broken down the key points which you 'll need to know so you can make the best decision for your ecommerce business . <p> LLC <p> Registering your ecommerce business as an LLC , or a Limited Liability Company , is often less expensive than incorporating the business . Setting up your business as an LLC will require less paperwork than it would if you were to incorporate , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store off the ground . <p> When you 've registered your ecommerce business as an LLC you wo n't be personally liable for any debts which your company accumulates . This means that your personal assets like your savings , car , and house will be completely safe if anything were to happen to your ecommerce business . <p> Another benefit of choosing to register as an LLC is that you 'll be able to rent your personal assets to your ecommerce business . For example , if you run your ecommerce business from a home office , you 're able to claim that space as a business expense . You 'll save some extra money by doing this which you 'll be able to put into other aspects of your business . <p> You 'll also be able to decide how your company is taxed . You 'll have the option to choose corporation tax for your ecommerce business , which means that you 'll be taxed at a much lower rate for the first $75,000 that you earn . You can apply for this taxation scheme by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When most think of corporations they think of multi-million dollar companies with hundreds of employees , but incorporation merely means that you 'll develop from a sole proprietorship into a company which is formally recognised as a legal business entity . <p> There are two main options which businesses can choose when they are incorporating ; registering as an S ' corporation , or a C ' corporation . There are no prerequisites to registering as either , it 's all down to which option is better for your ecommerce business . <p> Registering your ecommerce business as an S ' corporation will give you the option of pass-through taxation ' , which means that your ecommerce business will not be taxed on a business level . Instead , you 'll pay income tax on the revenue that your ecommerce business generates , but not the actual business itself . <p> On the other hand , C ' corporations are considered as a separate entity when it comes to taxation . This means that your ecommerce business will be subject to double-taxation ' , which means that you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taxed on your personal income . <p> Whichever structure you choose for your business entity , bare in mind that it is n't set in stone . As your business matures you 'll be able to move from one structure to another depending on the needs of your ecommerce business . <p> Choosing the State You 'll Register In <p> Take some time to consider in which state you 'll register your ecommerce business . The tax rates vary from state to state . However , you are n't required to register in the state where you operate your ecommerce business . Incorporating in a state which has low , or non-existent sales tax rates makes a lot of sense as it 'll save your ecommerce business money . Amazon , one of the biggest online retailers in the world , take advantage of this option . <p> Have a look through each state 's tax rates and decide which state is best to register in for your ecommerce business ' goals and immediate needs . <h> Obtaining Your Business ' Federal Tax Number <p> You also need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , you 'll need to obtain a federal tax number for your ecommerce business . Your federal tax number is also known as an employer identification number ( EIN ) , and it 's the equivalent of a social security number for your business . <p> As you 'll be filing tax returns and submitting reports on your business activity , it 's essential that you get a EIN number for your business . Without this number , you wo n't be able to submit your tax forms to either the federal or the state government . <p> If you decide to change the way that your business entity is taxed , like mentioned above by applying for corporation tax with the IRS form 8832 , then you wo n't need to get an EIN number right away . <p> You can apply online for your ecommerce business ' EIN number . It 's a simple application form and you 'll be able to get your EIN number on the same day that you submit the online form . <h> Opening a Business Bank Account <p> Banks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been registered as a legal entity before they will allow you to open up a business bank account . It 's essential that ecommerce entrepreneurs know how to register a business if they are looking to open a business bank account . <p> As an entrepreneur , you 'll find that opening a business account is a great way to separate your personal finances from those which you 'll be using to fund your ecommerce business . Having a business account is also clever for tax reasons you 'll be able to invoice certain payments and claim them as business expenses . <p> Opening a business account will give you a clear idea of the amount of money which your business is costing each month , and you 'll know the exact amount of money which your ecommerce business is making . <p> It 'll also give your ecommerce business more professional credibility . Customers will make payments for orders to your business account , instead of your name . This distinction instills confidence in your customer that your business is legitimate . <h> Register Your Ecommerce Business <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USA , you can go ahead and get started on running a legitimate ecommerce business . Once you 've completed the registration process we 've detailed in this article , your ecommerce business will be considered as a legal entity . And you 'll officially be the owner of a professional business . <p> If you have any further questions regarding the legalities of registering a business in the USA , just drop us a line in the comments section .

@@12738494 @1338494/ <p> Content marketing is the best gateway to market your business . The term refers to creating and sharing free content to convert visitors into customers . There are other things you should do like Facebook marketing or email marketing . But content marketing is where it all starts . And , to get started you 'll need a content marketing plan template . That 's what this post will talk you through . To get your first visitors you need to provide them with great content for them to learn about who you are . Content marketing is a good start in gaining traction . It 's also a great way to earn SEO among search results and trust among potential customers . <p> A good content marketing plan template will be divided into easy to digest section . We 'll go over each section one at a time and tell you what its best used for . <h> Set up goals <p> In order to gauge the success of your campaign , you need to set yourself some goal . Make sure it can be easily measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , it 's also clear when you 've reached them ! The other thing to note is to be realistic , otherwise , you 'll set yourself up for failure . <p> The strongest content marketing strategy has both short and long term goals . Long term goals can relate- to traffic , i.e. 10% month over month , or to increase visitors to 500 a month . Another good long-term goal is to improve your SEO . Short term goals should relate to leads or email subscribers . Do you want to reach 100 email subscribers in the next 4 weeks ? Do you want to get 100 leads in a week ? Whatever your goals may be , just be realistic . Do n't  forget that they need to be easy to track . <h> Target audience <p> Developing a successful content marketing plan requires an understanding of your target audience . It 's generally going to be the target audience of your business . You do have some wiggle room , though . It can be a campaign geared towards a specific subset of your audience like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a demographics within your business ' target audience that does n't make as many sales as you 'd like , you can target them with your campaign too . Knowing your target audience is important to create relevant content to them . If you need help there is a free template from HubSpot on identifying your buyer personas . <h> Social media <p> Now that you know who your audience is , you 'll need to figure out on which social medias they hang out . If your audience hangs out on Instagram , gear your content marketing towards Instagram . Otherwise , you wont be as successful . <h> Content types and ideas <p> Oh , where do I start with this one ? The most basic content type is a blog post . This post that you 're reading is part of Oberlo 's content marketing . The only thing that the content needs to be is useful and relevant . ( Okay , it should also be free . ) The type of content is up to you . It can be a video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo essay , a how-to , a listicle , an interview , an eBook , a book , a case study or even your own research . Convince &amp; Convert has a list of 105 content type ideas for you to choose from . Additionally , think about the types of topics that are relevant to your target audience . Choosing a topic might help you settle on the type of content you should be producing . <h> Audit your past campaigns <p> If you have previously done content marketing you should take inventory to learn from your past efforts . There are a few steps you 'll need to make in order to audit your inventory . The goal here is to measure what worked in the past and what did n't . This way you can strengthen your next campaign . <p> Figure out what works . Take a look at your past campaign and see what worked well . Which posts received the most traffic or the most subscribers ? If you can identify the type of visitor it resonated the most , do so . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Figure out what could be improved . Here you want to list things that were semi-effective but not a total failure . Make a note of things that could have been done better . This- can mean- making sure your campaign is more relevant to your target audience , to adjusting the timing or types of posts you make . Be constructive . This will help make your next campaign stronger . <p> Acknowledge what did n't work . Some things are just a miss . You do n't want to waste your efforts again . The best way to do so is to avoid things that did n't work . Here is your chance to list them out . Again , this can vary . For example , if some posts saw no traffic , why was it so ? Were the posts not shared ? Where they shared at a time where your target audience was n't online ? Or , was the topic completely irrelevant to your audience ? <p> The reason you want to do take inventory is to gauge your past social engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of your content marketing . If you have n't done an official campaign but have created content , that 's still useful . Just because it was n't part of an official marketing campaign does n't  mean you ca n't learn from it either . See how well the content is doing with traffic , social media or overall engagement . <h> Mapping your calendar <p> When planning your content make note of upcoming events . It can be big national events like Halloween or Fourth of July . Or it could be little silly things that your target audience might appreciate like National Siblings Day . Either way , use this to your advantage when planning your content ! It 's a great way to be relevant . <p> With all this in mind , it 's time to start mapping your editorial calendar . Once you settle on the type of content you want to produce , you 'll have to figure out who will produce it and when . As well as when the content will be published and where and when it will be shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that . <h> Content management <p> You 'll need to select a tool to help you with scheduling and publishing your content . A pen and calendar can do the trick if you 're really tight on budget . And , only if you 're organized . For the not so organized , there are tools like CoSchedule , Trello or even WordPress . There are lots of social media-specific tools as well , such as Later for Instagram . Although Later only helps with scheduling to Instagram . <p> You want three things out of a content management tool : who is creating what content , its status and when will it be published . If the tool can help you schedule the social media posting that is a big , big bonus . <h> Content marketing plan template <p> Now that you 've made it all the way through , here is a Google Sheet for your content marketing plan template .

Ok to be exact do you ask about the sudden not available situation from a technical wise or from a business prospective ? because i had an Online Comic Store once selling directly from facebook and i sold a lot of products that you are putting on your store and what i found is that the product can be found listed several times from several sellers and sometimes oddly cheaper . Also i contacted one seller selling GOT shirts for a large order ( 10 items ) he was listing it for $8 at that times and he reduced the price for my order to $4 a shirt ! <h> PopCultureTragic <p> In my experience as a customer , the more choice of a product the better ( within reason ) . Say I start a pet goods store . I do n't think 2 collars for dogs , 2 collars for cats , 2 beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dogs ... etc. would make people want to purchase ( you 'd reach 20-50 products very quickly ) . You need to give customers more choices than that , do n't you think ? Hence 350 .

I want to have something for every type of fan . <h> PopCultureTragic <p> Hi Hessein , yeah it 's the technical aspect . The products wo n't be available on my store until I manually switch to a different supplier on aliexpress , and keeping up with it is impossible . I 've stopped trying at the moment until I start getting sales but I was wondering if it 's a problem others encounter as well .

The limitations allow them to close a lot of fraudulent accounts and that cuts their costs significantly , so even if per every fraudulent account they also close 20 innocent ones , they are still fine with it . <p> Generally if you 've never been limited on PayPal before , you should only care about your performance as a seller and avoiding risky behaviour .

You might as well start learning about stealth right now , some would argue that from the beginning it 's good to have more than one PayPal account ( and being those accounts unlinked ) so that if " shit hits the fan " , you can forget about the limited account and use the alternative one , so that your cashflow does n't get interrupted . <p> Hope I have helped a bit <h> Masa <p> Sorry about late reply . <p> Thank you so much for detailed help .

@@12738518 @1338518/ <p> The moment you successfully convert a visitor into a subscribed lead , the conversion funnel begins . Apart from the user experiences you can deliver to customers when they are on your website , what is one of the best methods to keep them in contact and convert them into loyal buyers ? We 're talking about email marketing . Ask yourself : how well am I doing to maximize the conversion from my email campaigns ? Would somebody pin them on their Pinterest board as the best email marketing examples ? <p> Closely tracking email marketing statistics and doing a lot of A/B tests will bring you the best version of email campaign you can execute . How about best practices other businesses have done and seen great results from ? <p> What we know and what we think we have done well may probably not the best practice for our business . Learning from others is a crucial part in the process of improving our own strategies . <p> In today 's post , we put together 6 great email marketing examples , with interesting ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own email marketing strategies . <h> 1 ) Welcome new visitors <p> Just like when starting any relationship , you have to introduce yourself to your partner , to arouse their curiosity for learning more about you . It works the same in business . Especially in eCommerce industry where any shopper has hundreds of website options to choose from , actively reaching out to your visitors to make good impression about your brand can convert a large percentage into potentially paying customers . <p> What we like about Aritzia 's welcome email marketing examples is the aesthetically designed layout and beautifully crafted messages . The 3 best selling points of the brand are delivered clearly and attractively in very inspiring words , illustrated by great images . <p> First-time visitors may just browse a few pages on the store , take a quick look at some products , and then leave . But if they receive such a carefully written email with captivating images and messages , they will probably click the button and come back to the site to discover more . <h> 2 ) Activate new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to your store and have never made an order , some may never have the intention of purchasing . However , some probably found your store interesting but intended to come back later because they did n't really need your items at the time of their visit . Those are the ones who need to be activated to start making purchase with your brand . <p> Thrive Market takes a smart strategy . They activate online shoppers by giving them the exact incentive they want to start making first purchase with a new store a discount offer . For those who are still skeptical of your offerings , an exclusive discount is a great incentive for them to try with the first order . Thrive Market even creates a sense of urgency by limiting the validity of discount to give a little more push . <p> Considering the discount as marketing cost to acquire paying customers , it is worth giving up a portion of profit margin from first orders to have loyal customers and many more orders later on . <h> 3 ) Recover abandoned carts <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online store everyday thanks to your successful Ads campaign on Google and social media . A lot of visitors are raving about your products . So what ? Does that mean you are converting a lot of sales ? <p> Not really . e-Commerce industry sees an average cart abandonment rate of 68% . That means , out of every 10 online shoppers who add items to cart , 6-7 will highly likely drop their orders and leave the site . If you are investing a great amount into gaining traffic , cart abandonment rate this high definitely hurts your profit . <p> How can you fix this hole in your conversion funnel , convince those bouncing customers back and make them finish their purchase with email marketing ? <p> Ralph Lauren 's abandoned-cart recovery email campaign is one of the best email marketing examples to look at and learn from . This kind of email is highly effective as a recovery strategy , since many people drop their cart before checkout because of unintentional reasons such as crashing website , distraction or time-out . Ralph Lauren takes back their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the items they missed and motivate them to head back to the site and check out . <p> What they 've done well is the simplicity of the email layout : clean white background , consistent color blend , an outstanding CTA button , and most importantly personalized recommendation of products customers might want to buy instead , if they do n't like the items left unpurchased in cart . <p> No matter how perfectly the email campaign is executed , it can not promise to persuade 100% of your leaving customers to come back and complete their purchase . However , winning back even 20-30% of lost revenue is absolutely worth your efforts , especially with such a low-cost strategy like email marketing . <h> 4 ) Referral invitation <p> At this age when everything can be found on the Internet , people are perplexed by the diversity of goods and services online . What makes them trust a store is word-of-mouth reference from friends and families . That 's why referral invitation email is a smart and effective strategy to drive traffic from your current customers ' friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the email marketing examples : to motivate customers to introduce their products to other people , the brand offers awesome benefits to both referrers and referees . Why do n't customers click the button , when in just 2 minutes they can both send great deals to their friends and take their own free gifts ? And by citing complementaries from customers who love your products , you even add on more motivation for people to refer they will not be just introducing your products , you will be creating values and happiness , just like what your other brand lovers are enjoying . <h> 5 ) Recommend personalized products <p> Why personalized recommendation is powerful in today 's eCommerce is probably under no doubt . Recent research findings by Barilliance have proved that 12% of total ecommerce revenue is generated from product recommendations , and that people who click on product recommendations are found to have 5.5 times higher conversion rate than that of those who do n't . <p> If personalized product recommendation has been such an effective eCommerce strategy , why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Crate&amp;Barrel applies personalized recommendation into their email marketing : after customers make a purchase , they send an appreciation email to say thanks , combining with suggesting some other items that customers may like , based on their previous purchase . Wan na know why this kind of email is so smart ? <p> It is a nice manner to send thanks to your customers for buying stuff from your store . It makes your customers feel cared about and appreciated . It simply delivers a WOW experience that amazes customers and makes them want to come back for more . <p> The following recommendations based on what customers just bought are highly likely items customers will like . By analyzing what each individual customer browsed , viewed , added to cart and actually purchased on your store , you can make good guess of what they currently need or have preference for and might want to buy . <p> People simply hate advertising/promotion emails . Product recommendation emails are exactly one of the types that people will easily ignore in their inbox . However , they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order . Thus , combining recommendations in this email increases customers ' impressions of your suggested products . <h> 6 ) Request review for purchased items <p> The fact is , 90% of online shoppers read reviews before buying a product . And 88% of consumers trust reviews as much as personal recommendations . <p> No matter how captivating your product description is , online shoppers just consider it as advertisement ( and let 's be honest , what you write about things you want to sell is exactly advertisement , is n't it ? ) . Customers need more than that to pay money online : reviews and testimonials from previous customers who have real experiences with the products . <p> Mountain HardWear takes it into action : after any purchase , they will follow up customers with an email to request reviews for the items bought . How they convince customers to spend time writing the reviews is simple and straightforward : customer reviews give them motivation to improve products for brand lovers , and help other people make the right choice about what to buy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance of getting reviews , but Mountain HardWear has n't done , is to offer direct benefits for review writers . Writing a review is beneficial for both the brand and other fellow shoppers , but how about them , what can they get from spending time doing a favor ? Offer them an extra discount , a free gift , or free shipping on next purchases in return for their favor . Not only can you increase the chance of successfully requesting reviews but you can also get customers make more purchases to redeem the rewards . <h> Learned something from these email marketing examples ? <p> If you 've come to this part , we hope you have seen some great inspiration to innovate your current strategies . However , these email marketing examples are just references . Do n't take it for granted that they will work well for your business . <p> Instead , keep A/B testing your current versions with new versions inspired from these email marketing examples , improve every smallest elements to create the best version for your own store .

Who is your ideal customer ? What kind of life or lifestyle do they lead ? What are their pain points ? What problem is your product solving for them ? <h> Understand your customers purchase journey <p> The goal of a customer journey is to make your content fit well within it . You should n't just add a blog to your website and call it a day . Integrate your content into the purchase process . Most companies link to products on their blogs as needed . That 's important . Yet , more importantly , you can link to your content while selling your products . Show your customers useful information in their journey . Show them you are here to help them make a good purchase . That 's the whole point of content marketing ! <p> Start with a road map your customers ' journey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Yet , some of these should be backed up by doing research and interviewing your customers . Once you have this information it will be easy for your to see where and how your new content fits in . <h> Curate your content <p> I 've mentioned this briefly previously , but create content that is right for your audience . Avoid creating content that 's just another marketing message or worse , click bait . Your content marketing efforts will die a quickly and painfully . Never forget that content marketing is not about your company , it 's about your customers . I 'll say it again , content marketing is about your customers , not about you . Never forget this .

You 'll know which channels , platforms or even devices are used by your customers and audience through your research . Create content that fits well within those . <p> Lastly , do n't just create content , curate it too . You should n't only provide links to your own website . That 's selfish . People see through that . Share relevant , useful and quality content from others as well . It will make you credible . People like that . <h> Content marketing best practices : be organized <p> The short and sweet of it is , be organized . Keep an editorial calendar . Keep a social media calendar .

The key word for this article , for example , is content marketing best practices ' . <p> Include the keyword within your content copy : For the keyword to work for you , you 'll need to include in within your content multiple times .

Additionally , use it in the names of your images used in the content as well . <p> Always use the exact keyword term : Do n't use variations of the keyword . It defeats the purpose .

@@12738522 @1338522/ @qwx196606 <p> Starting a drop shipping business and dealing with returns is similar in any country in the world since you do n't have a warehouse full of physical goods . So I will try to answer your question about returns in a wider context . <p> To begin with , I do n't know whetherr you 're selling already , or just starting , but I 'd say that it is really important to study and prepare yourself for a return process . Especially , running a drops hipping business . <p> Why ? - A big portion of it is being processed by your supplier leaving you without any control on what is being shipped , how items are packed and etc . <p> Main reason why I emphasize on preparation is that when you start selling things moves quickly and returns do happen when you least expect it . Knowing the process helps you to solve each return case in a professional and timely manner . This builds up trust between you , your supplier and your customers . <p> Depending on the case you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Same applies to my decision making on whether to cover return shipping fees or to leave it as a responsibility of a customer . <p> I have discovered 3 most common types of returns and here 's my approach in dealing with them : <p> Customer ordered wrong product <p> An example of this could be wrong size shoes . Since this was not my supplier 's fault , but I decided to accept returns of this kind , I instruct my customers to send it to my personal address . Also , it was not my fault so I do not cover shipping fees . The only downside to this is that you 're stocking-up returned items , but you can always ship them when the next order comes in . <p> Product did not match the description on the web or in catalog <p> This can be really frustrating for both , you and your customer . In this case , your job is to provide great customer support and maintain good relationship with your supplier . Businesses do make mistakes and you can solve it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return I instruct my customer to ship their order back to the supplier and cover the return shipping fees myself . It is a noteworthy fact , sometimes I do make an exception and choose to receive returns at my address . It works as a quality control and helps me out in sourcing great suppliers and saying bye to the ones who fail to deliver great quality products . <p> Damaged items <p> It happens once in a blue moon , but it happens . I always cover the return shipping fees and indicate my supplier as a return address . It is also possible to claim back shipping fees from a courier if you use one of the more popular ones . <p> Note , cheap items might not always need to be returned . Sometimes , it is simply not worth your time . If you 're selling $1 Iphone screen protector your supplier is likely to send another one without getting into too many details . If not , just pay for the mistake this time and reap the profits from more expensive items . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be worried about the return process since successfully solved issue shows customer that you care and strengthens business relationship with your suppliers . <h> JKeitsuSorenson <p> anonymous000000 I accept returns to a P.O. box that I have setup . When a customer wants a return or exchange I have it stated that they are responsible for shipping it back and I simply refund the item amount .

@@12738532 @1338532/ <p> It is a long way from any idea in the basement to a real thriving business on the Internet . But things all start from the basics . So does an online dropshipping business , which starts with the question : " What is dropshipping ? " <p> If you are seeking an online business opportunity , you have got to know about dropshipping a modern online business model that requires very little initial investment . So what is dropshipping and why you should go for this model to realize your eCommerce entrepreneur dream ? <p> Let 's round up all the basics learn the things you must know before getting started . <h> What is dropshipping ? <p> Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store does n't  keep the products it sells in stock . Instead , when a store sells a product , it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer . As a result , the merchant never sees or handles the product . <p> Instead of keeping products in stock , you will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order placed , you will purchase products from the wholesalers and have them ship directly to your customers .

Dropshipping has both advantages and drawbacks that you should take into consideration before getting started . Let 's get down into further details about the pros and cons and basic things about running a dropshipping business . <h> What are the benefits of running a dropshipping business ? <p> Required almost nothing to start off , dropshipping is a highly potential business opportunity with a lot of advantages that attract eCommerce entrepreneurs who want to start out small before going big . <h> Almost no capital investment : <p> Because of the nature of dropshipping as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up-front investment into stocking goods . Instead , you only purchase the products from wholesalers when people place orders and forward you the payment . <h> Free of inventory and supply chain management : <p> Dropshippers never physically see , hold or deliver sold goods to customers . Thus , they do n't have to manage a warehouse and take care of the whole supply chain workflow , including packaging and delivery of items . <p> That being said , dropshipping business owners save a great amount of cost on maintaining a physical location for stocking products and human resource to run the whole supply chain system , compared to conventional e-Commerce businesses . <h> Low risks : <p> Since you do not have to acquire products beforehand , you are free from the risk of excess in inventory . Since no money is required to paid upfront on the stock , the only thing you would lose if your business does not come out as success is what you put into building your website and marketing to get traffic . <h> Wide variety of product offerings <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from as many wholesalers as you can thanks to the freedom from stocking products in inventory . No more worries about analyzing sales history to limit your inventory to best-selling product lines only . Instead , you can list any product lines you want to sell on your website , as long as they are hot items your potential customers want to buy . <h> Is dropshipping easy and simple as it may seem ? <p> Looking solely at the benefits , running a dropshipping business seems to be quite simple and free of headaches . However , like any other business models , dropshipping method has its own downside that you should be aware of before getting started . <h> High competition due to low barriers to entry <p> A wholesaler can partner with a lot of retailers to sell their products . Plus , low capital investment , freedom of risks , high scalability and wide product selection are all the low barriers to opening a dropshipping business . Thus , there are many other dropshippers providing the same products as you , making dropshipping a highly competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be very hard and challenging to stand out as a unique brand . <p> The nature of dropshipping is that you will not sell unique products . A lot of people have asked themselves : " What is dropshipping ? " before you . The high competition in this market drives the price down since the supply side is plenty . Thus , profit margin is usually low . If you can not find product lines or provide outstanding service that differentiates your brand from others , you as a small business in a large market will not able to compete on price . <h> Challenge of logistics when business expands <p> Though dropshippers does not have to directly deal with preparing , packaging and delivering products , they have to make sure the workflow goes smoothly , from sending customers the right tracking number , to ensuring the products are delivered on time . <p> Since they do not have any control over the process and have to fully trust the wholesaler , there could be a big challenge to solve when the business expands . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds , and products are ordered from many different wholesalers , the logistics system must be able to handle all orders without errors . <h> Key elements if you want success in dropshipping business : <p> Do n't be discouraged yet by the downsides of dropshipping . There 's still much you can do to build a highly profitable dropshipping business if you focus on optimizing these key areas that can promise you success in this business model : <h> Partner with the right wholesalers <p> Just as competitive as the retailer market is the wholesale market , where there are tons of wholesalers that you can find in any popular product lines . Researching and finding trustworthy suppliers to partner with is thus of paramount importance even before you set up your business . Make a checklist of criteria to select the best dropshipping suppliers for your business , make sure your partners are professional , reliable , responsive and have standards in their product offerings . - <h> Focus on getting traffic and optimizing conversion <p> While you count on your wholesale- partners to manage and deliver products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your site and optimizing the sales conversion . If you are bootstrapping your business and playing the one-man show , take SEO strategy and social media as prioritized initiatives . Increasing SEO rankings of your website by focusing on keywords that your target customers search for will bring you organic traffic from Google . Social media is becoming more important , as eCommerce-focused platforms ( Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest ) are making it more and more easy to reach users . - It could be very hard to get the first customers when you start off . You need to dedicate most of your time , investment and efforts to testing potential channels of traffic in the first 4-6 months . <p> At the same time , measure and improve the conversion funnel on your website , from increasing - add-to-cart rate , checkout rate to minimizing cart abandonment rate . Map out the sales conversion funnel from the moment customers land on your site to the moment they leave , analyze and fix the steps at which your customers drop . Step by step , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offer selling points that add values <p> In eCommerce , brands that merely sell physical products can not go big and compete . Successful businesses offer much more than that : they sell added value like top-notch services , information , emotional values , and solutions to customers ' pains .

I doubt anyone would like to import that many products and controlling the inventory levels would be a mess . <p> If you 're using our Chrome Extension , I 'm sure you 've noticed the once click import from the category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 20 products a minute ( if speed is a priority ) . <p> Here 's a GIF : <h> IgorAleksic <p> Hi Nazar , <p> actually this would be a GREAT feature because my team first reviews the products and then sends me an excel with the urls . <p> So it would be easier if we had in the oberlo management the ability to just paste all the url 's we want ( not one by one but in bulk ) . <p> Also i have noticed when viewing a " store " on Aliexpress the chrome extension does not work : / <h> simbabox <p> The thing that bothers me more is after I import the product into oberlo list ( all products are from the same collection/category ) , then I have to add the " tag word " ( which is empty by default ) and the " type word " ( which is empty by default too ) for each one ( 100+/- products ) then send them to my webstore ! Is there a way to fill in all those fields in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type words once and then send to my webstore ? <h> brokenthumbs <p> What about importing an entire store ? Easier and more efficient to delete products from the import list vs going back and forth importing products one by one . 
@@12738538 @1338538/ <h> How do you avoid paypal account limitations ? <h> JinMa <p> My PayPal account was recently limited and I wonder how to handle this and if there is any workaround to avoid it ? @qwx196609 <p> I think you ca n't avoid that . <p> We have quite a lot of experience with Paypal , their blocks , and request . If you have a new PP account , the limitations is the thing to expect . The annoying part is that you ca n't prepare for this . You ca n't submit your business documents or provide the description of your business model before they actually block you . <p> The first time they blocked us was when we received our first 15K in sales . They asked us to provide all the standard business information ( Company Registration Documents , Address Proof , etc . ) We did that and they informed us that the funds will be released only after all our products are delivered . And to prove it , we had to submit thousands of tracking numbers to PayPal and assign them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never took a look at them , but after a month or so we received a call that we can use half of the incoming money and the other half will be put in the rolling balance . <p> During that period , they probably tried to monitor the refunds rate and see if this is some kind of fraud or just a regular dropshipping business . We started rolling again , we even received a better Paypal fee and after some time a Paypal manager . They did know that we were doing dropshipping business , they did know that we had quite a few claims for refunds , but that was n't a problem . <p> The second account we opened for our other company went through a very similar , but slightly different scenario . We got a better offer in the beginning . We were already dropshipping for like 12 months and they allowed us to use 70% of all incoming transactions but we had to put 10K in a fixed reserve which we have n't withdrawn till now . <p> I think that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't really avoid it . Depending on your refunds rate , your country , your sales volumes , the person investigating your case the limitations might be different , but if you do everything according to the rules , there 's nothing they can do . <p> However , if you try to look for workarounds and try to avoid it by opening new accounts , using different names or something like that , you 'll definitely have problems . They 've invented fraud protection software that has been later used by the US government . They are not the people you can trick that easily : ) <p> So again , I suggest you just try to go through all the standard procedures , build trust , and grow your businesses more modestly but thinking long term . <p> P.S. One trick : Always contact PayPal by phone after you submit any documents . They 'll review them more quickly . <h> RiaSmiya <p> TomasSlimas hey , we 've just started an e-commerce , it 's not launched yet , but we are a little worry with PayPal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bank from our money to pay the orders and after the orders are delivered to the clients , our money will be deblocked ? Please let me know , it will be a big help . <p> Can we arrange something with the suppliers , so they can send the orders , if we do n't have enough money to pay in advance all ? <p> We do n't really know the procedure ... <p> Thanks a lot ! <h> Ruza <p> Thanks for that answer Tomas . I have probably put through 4-5k in Paypal so far and was wondering when they would be putting up a limit . So they do n't have an issue with you dropshipping at all ? What sort of shipping times do you have for most of your products ? <p> Thanks so much for your indepth response here . <p> Ryan @qwx196609 <p> Ruza Not sure . I believe you should have already received the request for more information on your business . Have n't you ? We had standard AliExpress shipping times : up to 15 days to the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> paulpl <p> How did you stay cash flow positive with the PayPal limitation ? If you set the price multiplier at x 2.0 and PayPal let you use only half of the incoming money then you would only make enough money to pay the supplier in China . Did you use funds from other business activity for marketing and end-of-month taxes ? @qwx196609 <p> paulpl You should operate in cycles . Once your funds are released , you run marketing campaigns up until you are out of cash ( because all of them are limited ) and then do a break . There are other specific workarounds ( like connecting your suppliers PP account to your store and getting your part in form of commissions ) but they are hard to arrange and takes a lot of time . <h> Urban <p> If they withheld 50% of our revenue and we only have a 50% margin ( 100% Markup/2 x Mutiplier ) we would n't have the ability to pay taxes and running costs of the business as 50% would go straight to the supplier straight away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store yet ... I might call Paypal and pre-empt them of what I 'm doing and get all info to them straight away and begin to build some trust there ... maybe this could help rather than us waiting for issues to arise ... certainly do n't want the business crippled from the get go ... need that cashflow . Tomas , when you said about operating in cycles , do you mean with the Credit Card cycles given we would n't need to pay that straight away giving us up to 50 odd days to pay without interest ? @qwx196609 <p> No , we meant that you work until you have cash and then make a break . Once more funds are released you repeat it . Increasing your markups should make things easier too . <p> We had negotiated better PayPal limitations the second time - but as I 've said , we were already in business . Besides , we were very careful . We submitted each tracking code to PayPal + when somebody made a claim , we sent them their packaged order photo ( we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack ) . <h> OHov @qwx196609 <p> OHov We had tracking codes for all our packages . We did n't work with the suppliers who do n't provide tracking codes . <h> MinhLe <p> Hello TomasSlimas . <p> I am quite new here . Of course , I did not have big avenue yet . But if I only work personally without any registered company , what will happen ? Thank you @qwx196609 <p> MinhLe Most likely you will be asked to provide company registration and other relevant documents when you hit some X amount of sales . That X varies from country to country , but at least in EU countries ( e.g. Lithuania ) , it 's around $2,000 . That 's what I experienced with multiple PayPal accounts myself . <h> tangomanthe2nd <p> TomasSlimas hi Thomas , I 'm setting up a store and shopify is suggesting accepting the quickbooks option for accepting credit cards .

I live in Brazil and I do n't  found today a way to make Paypal let me work in peace . It is very hard you know that a service that should be simple hinders your life . My problem is not making sales , my problem is to use the money to pay the tax and suppliers . All players in the market undergo similar situations to continue . I know Travis Patelle , talked to him and it seems to me that PayPal has more than $ 100,000 locked him it and all the money he gets Paypal puts 10% on booking and looks that he lives in the United States where the headquarters of Paypal .

I just hope the paypal do not block my account permanently because of this process . I solicited the judge account protection . This was the only solution I found , for me there is no other so far . If anyone has a solution or want to respond to this post is welcome . <h> Rina <p> So is it necessary to register a DBA then or is it ok to just go with just your legal name to do business and accepting Paypal payments under your individual account ?

Most of the packages are of low value and are often marked as gifts . <p> However , you ca n't be sure that will not happen .

@@12738549 @1338549/ <p> As entrepreneurs it 's always a good idea to determine which service is most profitable and will grow your business best . Recently , I 've been asked to investigate Salehoo to determine whether or not dropshippers should use their service . This Salehoo review will detail Salehoo pros and cons and whether or not it 's good for dropshipping . <p> Salehoo Review What is Salehoo ? <p> Salehoo is a wholesale supplier directory service that connects dropshippers to suppliers . The New Zealand company has suppliers from countries from the United States , UK and Australia on their platform . <p> Dropshippers use their sourcing tool to connect with suppliers , manufacturers and liquidators to get access to products at wholesale prices that they can sell to consumers . Many of Salehoo 's customers then sell the dropshipped goods via eBay , Amazon or Etsy to turn a profit . <p> Salehoo also offers website templates so dropshippers can start their own online store via their platform . While their backend is n't as powerful as Shopify 's it 's a fair starting point for inexperienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member to have access to this feature . <p> Salehoo Review Is Salehoo Legit ? While there is a high number of affiliate reviews online , the general consensus is that Salehoo is a legitimate company . Whether or not dropshippers are running highly profitable businesses via the platform can be debated . However , Salehoo does n't appear to be a scam , or a poorly developed solution . <h> Salehoo Review Is It Profitable ? <p> Take a look at the images below . In the first image , you see the Potential Profit a dropshipper can make on a Panda Onesie for kids according to Salehoo . However , on Amazon , the most popular seller of the product charges between $14.99 and $16.99 . In general , Amazon is an indicator for what market value really is for a product . A person selling it on eBay would be outpriced by the several variations of the same product available on Amazon for much cheaper . If a dropshipper were to follow the recommended $36.99 they would likely lose sales to dropshippers who are retailing the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropshipper may be able to make a profit on Salehoo , the amount is likely not as high as they 'd hope . <p> Salehoo Review Pros <p> Great customer service When it comes to customer service , Salehoo delivers it well . It has an A+ rating on Better Business Bureau . It 's obvious that this established brand , since 2005 , knows how to treat its customers . Customers of all price plans have access to phone and email support , though this is standard across most companies . Generally , people who use this service feel that customer service is fair . Customers do n't struggle to cancel subscriptions making this a legit company . <p> Has top brands as products Another great thing about Salehoo is that it has access to over 1.6 brand name products .

Notably , if a customer recognizes a brand , they 'll be more likely to search for a deal than if the product were unbranded . It 's much more difficult to know the source of an unbranded dropshipped product . <p> Harder to create own brand - With branded products , you 're forced to create a marketplace brand like Walmart or use a marketplace like eBay . Unfortunately , new startups lack the volume that mega brands like Walmart have built up over the years . In addition , using a marketplace like eBay is highly competitive which results in price feuds that eat away at your profits . With AliExpress dropshipping , unbranded products allow you to create your own brand where people keep coming back to your store . <p> Price Salehoo 's price is n't competitive within the dropshipping industry .

In addition , compared to the Oberlo Marketplace the number of products on Salehoo pales in comparison . <p> Most sell on eBay or Amazon which is overcrowded The ability to sell products on eBay or Amazon is amazing . However , when you 're a dropshipper , they 're the worst places to sell your products . You 'll be competing on price with other dropshippers and even the manufacturer .

@@12738550 @1338550/ <h> Create social media marketing plan objectives and goals <p> The goals of your social media marketing plan should align with the goals of your general marketing objectives and business goals . The best advice is to use the SMART acronym to establish your goals . SMART stands for specific , measurable , attainable , relevant and time-bound . Your social media marketing plan 's goal should fit these criteria . <p> For example , on Twitter , we want to increase our follower count to 500 users by regularly sharing inspiring fashion ideas over the next 3 months . <p> The above can easily be an example for a drop shipping business with a newly made Twitter account . To make sure your social media marketing plan is successful , create a realistic and measurable goal . <p> Your goals can be something small . For example , seeing a social engagement effect on just Facebook . However , your plan can be made up of various- goals for individual social networks . It will depend on how much manpower you 're capable of dispatching for this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit means to comb- through your current accounts- and identify their key features . What social media does your company use right now ? Who is in charge of each account ? What is the purpose of that social media outlet ? <p> Next , you 'll want to evaluate how effective the social media is with its engagement . Are you getting a lot of links on Facebook ? How many retweets is your Twitter account getting ? Study what your social networks are like now . You ca n't improve them if you do n't know their current state . What kind of posts are getting the most engagement ? Which ones get the least ? Which demographic of your audience does not respond to your posts ? And so on . <h> Analyze your target audience <p> Additionally , you 'll want to figure out where on social media your target audience hangs out . If you 've been putting a lot of effort into Facebook marketing but a large portion of your target audience uses Instagram , it 's time to switch gears . By analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more fruitful . If you 're missing a specific social account , make it . If you 've been underusing one , this is the time to change that . <p> Go further and study what kind of content your target audience engages with . This will make things much easier for you . You wo n't have to guess . You can also get inspired by other leaders in your area . There is nothing wrong with learning from your competitor . Do an audit of their own social media account . Which of their account show the most engagement ? What kind of content and posts receive the most likes or retweets ? <h> Creating an editorial calendar <p> A good content plan is the cream and butter of your social media marketing plan . This is what stuff your audience will consume . To start your editorial calendar you need to answer a few things . Ideally , you 're creating the content you 're sharing . This way it all leads back to you . You can share other people 's content as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back directly to you . However , there is something to be said for following brands that are truly useful and selfless . But , I digress . Your editorial calendar needs to answer the following questions : <p> How often will you create new content ? <p> Who is responsible for producing it ? <p> When will it be published ? <p> When and where will it be promoted on social media ? <p> Additionally , it 's a good idea to have a separate calendar for what your posts will look like on social media itself . For that , you want to look into tools like Buffer for Twitter , Facebook and Google Plus . Or , Later for scheduling posts on Instagram . You should have a calendar for each media that you plan on using . Your goal here is to know exactly where things are being posted . Be strategic and post when your- audience is most active . <p> Do n't limit yourself to just posting new stuff . You can repost or retweet as part of your schedule as well . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can designate a certain percentage of specific types of postings . For instance , 15% of your posts will be linked to other resources while 25% will link back directly to your blog . At the same time , you can allocate a day to something specific . For example , Tuesday you 'll post tips on bargain shopping . The good thing here is to be strategic and creative with planning the actual calendar . <h> Adjust your social media marketing plan to the flow <p> Like with most marketing efforts , test your plan to keep improving it . If you 're noticing that a certain type of post is doing better or worse , act accordingly . If you 're noticing a shift of time in engagement , go with the flow . Your target audience is made up of human beings and no one knows how they will react . Always test variations of posts to see which one works best . It 's the safest way to ensure your social media marketing plan is going to succeed . <p> Whatever you do always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic and traffic flow . It 's important to know what your visitors are doing as a result of your campaign . Use analytics to see how effective your marketing plan is and adjust accordingly .

It 's a competitive playground that challenges even the savviest entrepreneurs , yet the overwhelming consensus is that setting up an online store is a life-changing experience. - <p> One of the most liberating facts is that you can grow your business way beyond the borders of your city or your country without ever leaving your work desk ! Once you 're online , virtually anyone from anywhere in the world can become your customer . <p> But where do you start ? <p> There are simple tactics to figuring out how to sell online and they all stem from the answers to three basic questions why , what and how ? <p> Well , duh , right ? <p> But here 's a neat summary of everything you need to know about how to sell online . Could n't get any easier . <h> Why selling online is the new black ? <p> Can you imagine your life without the Internet ? No emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like the banishment from Heaven all over again ! <p> And that 's precisely why the eCommerce industry is living its golden age . Everyone is connected and cozily nestled in their own little online bubbles with no intention of going back to the old ways . Plugging into this trend is beginning to look like the smartest way to start an online business . <p> Here 's more on why . <h> #1 Your business goes where you go <p> Let 's get this one out of the way first forget about *real* vacations without a laptop , at least for the first year or so . <p> When you run an online business , any place in the world can become your office , and more often than not , you 'll end up working weekends , nights and holidays . The only difference being that you 'll do it with a smile on your face . <p> Work from the beach or your grandma 's garden wherever you go , you 're just a tap ( and a wifi connection ) away from accessing your business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> #2 Zero savings ? Start a business with no money in the bank ! <p> The beauty of the online world is that you can get the business off the ground with very little initial investment . It depends , of course , on what kind of business you 're plotting to start , but for the sake of this article I 'm assuming you have your mind set on running an online shop . And when it comes to selling online , dropshipping seems to be the go-to strategy . <p> With minimum overheads , such as paying for the hosting of your e-shop and running some online ads , you can build a profitable and sustainable business in just a few months . And it 's not some kind of fantasy , there are real success stories to prove it . <h> #3 Making money 24/7 <p> Whereas physical shops are restricted to opening and closing times , online stores run twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week . All the time . It does n't take a genius to see the potential in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to your store and your conversions are optimised to a good standard , you 're basically making money in your sleep. - <p> This touches on another solid benefit of selling online if done right , it can be a sweet source of passive income . It is less time-intensive than , say , running a brick-and-mortar boutique because you do n't need to be present at all times . With automated inventory management and robust online marketing plan , your store can generate a sufficient amount of money with very little extra input from your side . <p> Now , that sounds like a dream come true . <p> Until you hit the next cornerstone of this process . What will I sell ? <h> What you can sell online : sourcing ideas when you 're stuck <p> Let 's leave the question of how to sell online for a moment and focus on WHAT to sell instead . Finding the million dollar idea is not an easy task . But sometimes , the answer might be hiding in plain sight . So if you know where to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piggybacking on trends - <p> Who does n't want to be a trendsetter ? A pioneering genius with a ground-breaking idea ? It 's a blazing dream of many entrepreneurs . Yet , the eCommerce world is n't always kind to unique ideas . To get the sales engine turning , an e-store needs to serve a high demand in a market , tap into a growing niche or trend that will define its profits . - <p> When you 're on the hunt for a money-making idea , it pays off to put your ear to the ground and listen to what the customers want . Yes , I 'm talking about the top selling and bestselling lists , trend reports and product curation lists . <p> Start your initial research by casting a wide net . First , review the new and upcoming trends on online retail giants , such as eBay , Amazon or Etsy . What are the month 's top picks , most favourite- products or bestselling items ? Can you spot any particular trends like colours , shapes , fabrics or patterns ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends right now , but not everyone 's ready to spend a hundred bucks on a fancy rucksack ! Selling a similar-looking product is a smart way to get your cut on this trend . - <p> When you have a rough idea of what you want to sell online , it 's time to find a way to source these products for your online store . And one of the best places to look for dropshipping products is AliExpress . Give its Top products ' and Weekly bestselling ' categories a thorough look and you 're almost guaranteed to find something that meets your needs . <p> Your next logical step is to choose high-margin products . <h> #2 Aim for healthy margins <p> What matters at the end of the day is how much money you get to keep . Healthy margins will determine the future of your eCommerce business , so you should do everything you can to invest your time and effort into products that will yield the best results . The average eCommerce gross margin is approximately 40% . However , every market and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition and the going rate . <p> Some of the easiest tactics you can use to maximise the profits include ensuring prominent website presence for your high-margin winners , putting them at the front of your marketing initiatives and cross-selling campaigns , and adding variations of the bestselling items ( think different colours , sizes and shapes ) . <h> #3 Follow in the footsteps of eCommerce winners <p> Again , sometimes the best ideas hide in the plain sight . Why try to reinvent the bicycle ? Capitalising on useful resources , such as Oberlo 's 100 Things to Sell in 2017 , is the ultimate shortcut to kicking off a successful online store .

Another big plus for eCommerce beginners is the opportunity to test the demand for the products they offer . Once they establish a good sense of what 's popular , it 's time to start building an online store . <p> Why shift the strategy when it starts returning a profit ? Many reasons . The big dogs like Amazon , eBay or Etsy will charge you a commission for every sale . And it 's a painful experience to give your hard-earned money just like that !

@@12738561 @1338561/ <p> According to Lemonstand , there are over 650,000 eCommerce sites worldwide selling more than $1,000 per year . Moreover , many more sites are yet to come , and we see that this number is ever increasing . So if you want to enter this world , too , you can check out different tips for starting an eCommerce business . However , the most important advice for already ongoing businesses in the eCommerce sector is adapting eCommerce personalization tools . Even though it looks like only one tip , eCommerce personalization is a whole topic itself which has many subtopics and hence many different tips and tricks on this topic . Today , after explaining precisely what eCommerce personalization is I will talk about the eCommerce personalization tools through which one can achieve this goal and have higher conversion rates hence get more revenue . <h> Personalization <p> The term personalization itself is a well-known word . In Wikipedia , it says that it is also known as customization and its primary goal is to improve customer satisfaction . You can find examples of personalization almost everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One way or another everybody craves customized experiences and here is why . So you can think of it as a one-to-one marketing . That is why personalization plays a crucial role in customer engagement . Once you play this card wisely and correctly taking the customers ' needs and wishes into account , the customers will get engaged to your business . And this attachment is actually what every business owner is looking for . You as a client would feel satisfied or even happier when Siri says hi to you personally on the phone or when you open up your browser , and it welcomes you calling your name or when you go to your regular barbershop , and the barber already knows what you want . You do n't even bother to explain anything . Or when you go to an eCommerce site , and it gives you product recommendations that exactly match your interests and needs . <h> eCommerce <p> As for the eCommerce sector , according to last year 's data the size of the eCommerce sector is over $1.5 trillion and it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector for every eCommerce business owner . However , one should n't forget that only less than 3% of all eCommerce websites make more than a million and 34% of them make less than $10k yearly . Hence , even though the eCommerce world is huge , it is hard to survive in this ocean and differentiate yourself from your competitors . Right at this point personalization is one of the most important factors of how you can differentiate . eCommerce personalization increases the conversion rate and decreases the bounce rate through which you can make more money . But more importantly , as I said before , personalization is strongly tied with engagement and attachment through the satisfaction of your customers . So once you establish this connection with your visitors , they will become your regular customers , and you will have a much better brand image and higher revenues . <h> eCommerce personalization tools <p> Now , since we know what personalization is and we have a general overview of the eCommerce sector and the importance of personalization in eCommerce , the main question is how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools one can use which we call eCommerce personalization tools . There is n't only one type of tool , but you 'd better use a set of tools which would bring you more committed customers and more revenue . Let 's explore some of these tools and their applications . <h> Analytics tools <p> First of all , one should monitor the visitors ' behavior and understand them to offer them personalized products/services . These analytics tools help you figure out what is going on in your website and see your products and services ' performance . Let me give you an example here . For example , you think that a particular product would become a best seller , so you put it on your homepage . However , when you check the analytics data , you see that you only got a few sales and your expectations did n't come true . Thanks to this analytics tool you see that you could n't forecast it right and you can now take some precautionary actions , such as remove that product widget from your homepage . Another example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools such as Trendify the eCommerce business owner can see if a product is demanded much but ca n't be supplied because there is not enough product in your inventory . This can also be anticipated very easily , and measures can be taken now . <h> Email marketing <p> Email marketing is one of the largest eCommerce personalization tools because it has a very high conversion rate . Especially , if you can target the visitors correctly and remind them that they forgot their carts recommending related products it is very likely that the customer would come again and this time make the purchase . You can refer to this article to see the best examples of email marketing . So personalized content within correctly targeted emails is going to increase your conversion rates for sure . <h> Recommendation <p> This is the best place where you can see a real example of personalization . Recommendation engines , I would say the most important eCommerce personalization tool , work towards your conversion goal by monitoring customer behavior and offering the right products to the right customers at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the most relevant application of big data and machine learning that touches our daily lives . Here is a relevant page explaining recommendation engines . <h> Feedbacks and social media <p> It is always good to be in touch with the customers . Since you do n't have a store and a salesperson directly in contact with the client , you somehow need to listen to their problems and try to find individual solutions to them . For example , Zendesk is a software example that establishes better customer relationships . You can use many more different tools , central idea being listening to the customers and satisfying them with appropriate solutions . As for the social media , it is a very useful tool to listen to the audience and to take actions accordingly . Some of the benefits of social media marketing for your eCommerce business are explained in this blog post . <h> Conclusion <p> Through all these eCommerce personalization tools and preferably many more of them , you will finally have deeper engagement with your customers . They will feel more unique and think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need or want . This personalized experience will , in the end , turn into greater conversion rates and thus more revenue for your eCommerce business .

@@12738571 @1338571/ <h> How to hire , train and manage your virtual assistant <h> randomphantom <p> Hey guys , I have n't seen much discussion on this topic so I thought I 'd start a thread where everyone can share methods , videos , pdfs , and any other resource regarding hiring and training VAs for their Shopify stores . <p> Personally I 'm just starting this process myself as I 've been doing everything myself so far which is starting to drive me crazy . Any tips and advice would be greatly appreciated . Hopefully this also helps everyone else who is in the same boat as me. @qwx196606 <p> Here is my take on having a virtual assistant : <p> So your business is already taking off and there is a bunch of tasks pilling up making you feel like bitting more than you can chew . Meanwhile it is a first sign of a success , as your business grows , the burden of increasing work load can become slightly overwhelming . If you are experiencing a really tight schedule , unbearable workload , and painful repetition - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to hire a virtual assistant . <p> It is important to take it into consideration that hiring your first virtual assistant is a lengthy process , which requires a lot of time and preparation . <p> At first , you should define which tasks will be transferred to your VA . Whilst it is easier said than done , one way to tackle this is to create a system of how certain tasks should be completed , master it yourself , create a training program based on your own experience and hand it off to a person who is about to take over . <p> Secondly , be ready to put aside some quality time in training your virtual assistant . It might take a bit for a person to delve deeper and get to know your business . <p> Finally , hire like your business depends on it . You should treat hiring a virtual assistant the same as bringing another person to your company . I would highly recommend to ask for a resume and arrange an interview . This will help to determine wether VA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . <p> When it comes to training and managing your VA here 's what I discovered : <p> Start with setting foundations first . Your VA should be familiar with processes and procedures . Quantify what it takes to perform the tasks you want your VA to manage . You can either describe them or record how you complete each task and share it via edible Google docs . This is the easiest process to create a content which your VA can follow . <p> I would highly recommend to start using Project Management System ( i.e. Basecamp , Slack , Asana , etc . ) . You can access a list of Project Management Systems here - http : //bit.ly/1mPuCk4 This will allow you to communicate tasks to your VA in a more reliable manner . Otherwise , chances are high that some of the tasks you send via email might get lost in your virtual assistant 's mailbox . <p> Lastly , communication is the key to successful working relationship with your VA . Do n't shy away from over-communicating your needs especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant on what you require . <p> Did you find some great strategies of your own ? What is your take on hiring , training and managing VA ? <p> Looking forward to getting more insights on this topic ! <h> JKeitsuSorenson <p> I thought I 'd chime in onto this since I 'm in the process of hiring a VA to process orders since I ca n't be burdened with this menial task : ) <p> It 's a bit interesting since you ca n't really set permissions for your own aliexpress account ( at least not that I 'm aware of ) Therefore you just have to trust that the VA wo n't bite the hand that feeds . They do n't need card info because you can save that into an Ali Pay account and all the VA has to do is click pay . <p> A few big notes : just make sure you cover the grounds for Shipping Address EXCEPTIONS especially if you 're shipping everywhere in the world like I am and provide clear training on the following : <p> -Most United Kingdom customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VA will need to look up . A very easy task to do just searching the city into google and finding which province they are in . <p> -Of course Aliexpress does n't accept non-English characters so those must be replaced appropriately . <p> -Puerto Rico customers always select the USA as their country , the VA will need to select Puerto Rico as the country instead to work . <p> -Andddddddd ... for those exceptions , you must copy and paste the aliexpress order # into oberlo manually since it will not recognize the order because of the address changes you made in aliexpress . <p> All that being said , the VA will still need to have good attention to detail . I know I 've messed up personally a few times myself ! I hired someone off of Upwork and it does seem like some people are familiar with shopify and a very select few with this oberlo app before I even mentioned it in private discussion ! <h> Sonny <p> JKeitsuSorenson HI ! , I noticed you had some good info on ways and problems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could possibility answer . I 've been getting the same problem with Puerto Rico Orders And they would put united states as country instead of Puerto Rico And PR is State/Province/Region so every time you would need to go in and fix this Issue to Fulfill the Order . Now my questions are Did you find a way around this to be automated And What should I put in the State/Province/Region Form so the orders are FulFilled correctly . If you could answer these questions It would HELP me A LOT ! I 'm also guessing other people are probably having the same questions , Thank you for your time ! <h> JKeitsuSorenson <p> @Sonny yeah at least so far there is no way to automate the changing of Puerto Rico . You just have to select Puerto Rico as a country manually . Sure it takes a few seconds extra but that 's really not too bad ! Still beats inputting ALL of the information manually

Am I able to change them in shopfiy after they 've been imported or do I need to change them in oberlo before they 're pushed to the shop ? Oberlo only allows you to change the variant and not the variant type . I would imagine none of this matters because to me it would make sense for oberlo and aliexpress to go by sku but I 'm not entirely sure . I ask this because I 've been told several different things by different people . <p> I was also wondering if there is any danger in setting my prices manually . I have a store I 'm about to launch that will do much better with hand-picked pricing and I 'm wondering whether or not this will mess anything up from an inventory perspective . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cost increases have the price increase by that exact amount . <p> What happens when I have my auto-update settings as " when cost changes - do nothing " . I would imagine that is referring to only the price ? @qwx196606 <p> You can change variant types and how they are named in Shopify after a product was pushed to your store already . It 's a pity , but it is not possible to do that directly in Oberlo at the moment . When a product is pushed - you can edit its images , description , variant names , options just make sure not to change variant SKUs or remove and then add/duplicate variants - this will cause Oberlo losing the track of such products . <p> It is currently not possible . You can either let Oberlo manage price automatically , or do everything entirely manually . Few stores are managing their prices manually and doing it very successfully - just enable Oberlo to send notifications when prices changes - and you will never loose the track . Note , this can only be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mightt be a bit time consuming . <p> Yes , this is referring only to price . You can still set Oberlo to send you notifications then - as I have mentioned above . <p> Hope this was of any use and let me know if you are still not sure about these things ! <h> KylePuckhaber <p> I thought I had my pricing set before I pushed my items over to my shopify site . Apparently I did n't .

@@12738581 @1338581/ <p> The goal of an ecommerce store is to make money . When you increase average order value , you make more money from each transaction making your store more profitable .

For example , get $10 off when you spend $75 , get $15 off when you spend $100 , get $25 off when you spend $150 or more . <h> Offer bundle deals to increase average order value <p> Providing customers bundle deals can help increase average order value . For example , you can provide a buy 2 and get a free gift or buy 3 and get a 4th free . You can easily do this with the Free Gifts app in the Shopify app store . <p> As products on AliExpress are affordable , you 'll need to ensure you choose free gifts that wo n't impact your product margins too greatly . If you provide a buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure your products are priced in a way that you can afford to cover the costs of the 4th while still making more profit from the bundle deal . <p> According to Inc. , there are numerous benefits of bundling . First , it can increase the customer experience . Second , it can make decision making easier for customers . Third , it can validate a customer 's decision . <h> Offer a gift card to increase average order value <p> Gift cards are a great way to increase average order value , even when giving a small one away for free . For example , if all products in your store are $25 or higher , you can offer a free $5 gift card for a customer to use with their next purchase . Since they have a gift card they 'll be more likely to spend again . <p> However , you need to make sure that your product prices are high enough that your gift card does n't result in a free purchase for your customer as that would cause profit loss . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the gift card on the current purchase or on shipping ( if you offer free + shipping on certain products ) . <p> Lastly , having gift cards offered encourages future purchases which helps reduce future ad spend . It 's a great bonus to give customers when sales are seasonally lower but you should n't offer this deal year round . <p> Keep in mind that even if you do n't give a free small gift card , gift cards still help increase average order value as most do n't spend the full card or end up spending much more than their card provides them . <p> You can offer a gift card to customers directly from Shopify . In your admin , click on Products . ' Then , look down the menu . Gift cards ' will be the last item in the menu . <h> Giving first time offers to increase average order value <p> If you 're a relatively new brand ( under 6 months old ) most of your customers will be first timers . Offering deals to new visitors can help increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with special discounts when they buy multiples of a popular product or exclusive bundle deals just for people who have n't shopped with you before . <p> If your customer orders several items and loves what they receive , it 'll be even easier to entice them to come shop again . They 'll already have experienced your brand first hand . Thus , you have a better chance of turning them into a returning customer . <p> You can offer one time discounts with the One Discount app by Ori Kremer in the Shopify App store . <h> Show cross-sell and upsell items to increase average order value <p> A cross-sell is an item that a customer may like that 's different from the product they 're viewing . For example , if your customer is looking at a dress you might have a recommended product of a pair of earrings that look amazing with it . You can use the Cross-Sell app by Keeping Shop Ltd . <p> A great idea for cross sell is to add the products the model is wearing to the recommended products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank top , you might add the skirt as a cross-sell . Since the customer sees the two together , they 'll be more likely to purchase them in combination . <p> An upsell is when you encourage customers to buy more expensive items or additions to increase average order value or profit . For example , if you sell pillows you might upsell with comforter sets , a duvet or other item . You can use the Free Gifts app by Secomapp . <p> An effective way to upsell products is to sell more of the same product . For example , if you sell essential oils , you would upsell by recommending the same scent and a couple of popular scents to the customer . The reality is people are likely to buy more of what they love , especially if it 's likely to run out at some point . This works well for beauty products as well . <h> Show cross-sell and upsell items to increase average order value <p> Having a loyalty program in place can help increase average order value . Each time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being loyal customers . <p> The benefit of having a loyalty program is that it helps build brand evangelists , customers who keep coming back to your website to shop . According to The ROI from Marketing to Existing Customers- report , 40% of a store 's revenue comes from repeat customers . Only 8% of all store visitors are repeat customers . Repeat customers are also more likely to buy more than people who are unfamiliar with your brand . <p> By encouraging repeat sales , you help create a larger fanbase who will likely order larger quantities of products . They 're also cheaper to advertise to via retargeting , social media or email marketing . Thus , these evangelists help increase average order value . <h> Offer time sensitive deals to increase average order value <p> You can offer a time sensitive deal to help increase average order value . For example , you might have a 48 hour deal where someone gets a free gift or a special discount when they 've ordered a certain quantity of products . <p> While it might not increase average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversions . Time sensitive deals are great for boosting average order value during slower periods . <h> Show savings with bulk orders to increase average order value <p> People love saving money . However , when your customers order large quantities , they sometimes feel guilty about it . If they feel they overspent , they might ask for a partial refund lowering the average order value . <p> However , if you show customers how much money they 're saving per item with each addition , they 'll feel like they 're scoring a deal . Showing people the monetary savings they get from buying multiple items can help increase average order value . <h> Creating a game or a contest to increase average order value <p> The food industry often creates games or contests to increase average order value . For example , McDonalds has the Monopoly Game where customers are incentivized to order more frequently and upgrade their meals to get more game pieces . With the game pieces they have a chance of winning big prizes . Read more about McDonald 's Monopoly Game marketing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run contests where customers have a chance to win prizes when they buy often . You can let customers know that if they 've made a purchase they 'll be entered into the contest where they can win one of several prize packs . Then , you can search the Shopify App store for the contest app that works best for your campaign . <p> Viral Sweep- is a great app that allows you to offer contests and sweepstakes . <p> What have you implemented to help increase average order value ?

Have fun building up your average order value ! <p> Shaker <p> Hi Nicole , <p> Great article as usual = Couple of questions for you : <p> 1 ) What payment provider do you use on your shopify store ? I 'm based in canada so I have a decent variety of payment service providers available to me such as paypal and stripe . I 've heard of alot of horror stories where people are using paypal or stripe or someone else and they got shut down , because the payment providers are n't  okay with dropping shipping ( i think it goes against their terms or something ) . <p> What payment providers do you use and how have you found them to be ? What do you do to stay on their good side ? Are payment providers okay with dropshipping in general ? <p> 2 ) What currency do you use on your store ? My understanding is that only one currency can be used on your store at a time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an app to show the price in local currency , but they pay in your store currency ( ie usd ) ? How do you handle it ? <p> 3 ) You know how alot of aliexpress says on some of the products that the color of the product can vary a little bit because of the variations in the computer screen , would you have a similar dicsclamer in your store if you had products where the color could vary a little because of the computer screen ? <p> Hi Nicole , thanks so much for mentioning our Cross-Sell Shopify app , Im pleased you like it . Any chance you can get in touch via Twitter or provide me with an email address that I contact you on ? Thanks again ! <p> Nicole <p> Hey Steve , no problem . Ive PMd you on Twitter . <p> Nicole <p> Hey Shaker , <p> Thanks for the feedback ! 1 . We use PayPal , Apple Pay , bitcoin and Stripe . Havent had any issues . PayPal is pretty popular for sales so I 'd definitely recommend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of misinformation out there . 2 . USD . We have a currency converter that tells the customer the price in their currency . However , they still get charged in USD and are aware of that . 3 . You can definitely add that disclaimer in . Its not an AliExpress issue though . A lot of websites mention this . You can add it to your terms of service . Does n't  need to be mentioned on every product page . <p> Shaker <p> Hey Nicole , <p> I was not expecting bitcoin ! What was the rationale behind that ? <p> 1 ) How do you think about pricing in usd even through you have a global base of customers ? Ex . If I say a shirt is $30 USD , that 's fine and reasonable . But if a canadian customer sees it its a almost $40 cad , which seems more expensive ( even though it accounts cad $40 is equal to 30 usd ) . How do you balance in pricing in usd , with the fact that the price of the items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem unreasonable ? <p> 2 ) Someone mentioned that they got a test package from AE . They said it had the cost on it ( which was ofc many times lower than what the customers paid on the site , and said it was from china post ) , but did not have the invoices/promotions , etc . <p> Have you found that the packages that your suppliers sent out have the cost on it ? <p> This particular user was freaking out because they thought that the customers would feel ripped off ? How would you handle this ? <p> Nicole <p> Were flexible with how people pay most do n't  pay via bitcoin though ! 1 . On my site , customers do n't  see USD pricing only for their currency 2 . We 've processed a lot of orders on our store but it only happened to us once . If the same product keeps having the issue change suppliers . For the most part , they do n't  send invoices though . <p> Francis Palladino <p> Hey Nicole , how do i handle customers that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And do you recommend to only just selling within the US ? <p> Nicole <p> Hey Francis , First , I 'd check the product tracking to see when the product was shipped . Then check to see how long it takes for that product to ship so you can give a customer a ball park on when it should arrive to ease their nerves . Make sure every product is delivered via ePacket makes a difference . Be friendly with your customer and apologize . Sorry for the delay . You should be receiving your product in days . Ill check back in a few days to make sure you 've received it. For my store , we mix up our countries a bit for ads . We target the US but also other countries as well . Ads for other countries are often cheaper I find and still converts well . Do n't  limit yourself . With ePacket there 's a growing number of countries that can have quick and cheap shipping . Test to see which countries work best for your store .

Security is a major component of all payment gateways , therefore every transaction that occurs between the merchant and the issuing bank is encrypted to protect sensitive financial information . <p> Although the transaction process takes only a few seconds , several steps are accomplished during that brief window of time .

It is well-known among eCommerce merchants that if they are unable to find their preferred method of payment , shoppers tend to cancel their purchase and look for the product elsewhere . It 's not uncommon for country markets to be dominated by local payment solutions . Doing a bit of research into your target market 's shopping habits and preferences , especially if a lot of your customers are based in foreign countries .

Every order I have placed specifying ePacket ( where I am paying a higher purchase price than I would with other vendors to get it shipped this way ) has been shipped by a cheaper method . <p> It is very discouraging because these are " Top-Rated " sellers I am ordering from and not only is e-packet chosen at checkout , I include a note saying please ship ePacket . Also worth noting all of these orders are going to USA . Then I get a SunYou or China Post tracking number . <p> It is too soon to file a dispute with AliExpress , and I 'm left wondering are there any honest suppliers on AliExpress ? I wish I had done some test orders first before getting real orders and now having potentially unhappy customers . <p> Has anyone else had similar experiences ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience that . Tell them if they do not use ePacket you will take your business to another supplier . If they do n't oblige then use a different supplier . <p> Just FYI though , ePacket is only to the US .

Google Analytics Shopify integration comes to the rescue ! <p> Analytics is what separates the amateur e-commerce store owners from the professional ones . <p> Unfortunately , few people truly use the power of data to understand how their business is doing . That 's a fatal mistake . <p> You need to know whether what you are doing is working or not . If you do n't  , you will stay behind your competitors , losing more clients and money each day that goes by . <p> The best way to get started with analytics is by using the quintessential tool : Google Analytics . <p> At first , it may seem a bit daunting , but once you get to understand it , you will see its not that hard to use it and understand the data it shows you . <p> In this article , I will show you how to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Google Analytics Shopify Step #1 : Open your account <p> The first thing you need to do is visit Google Analytics website . Once you are there , click the " Sign up " button that appears to the right of the page . <p> Then , you need to fill out the following form : <p> Put your account and stores name , website address , industry category , and time zone . Below those fields , you have the option to share your data anonymously with Google . <p> I recommend you give your accounts name a clear and concise name . Usually , the name of your company works just fine . <p> Once you fill all this information , click the " Get Tracking I 'd " button . <p> As soon as you do that , you will be shown Googles Analytics Terms of Service Agreement . Read it through ( I know you wo n't ) , and then click " I Accept " . <p> Once you accept Googles ToS , you will have opened your Google Analytics account . Pretty simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code to your Shopify store . <h> Google Analytics Shopify Step #2 : Install tracking code <p> After you accepted the Google Analytics ToS , you will be taken to a page where you can see a " Tracking I 'd " , and a 9-number code that starts with " UA " . <p> Copy that tracking I 'd , and then go to your Shopify store admin page . In there , click Online Store &gt; Preferences . Once you are in there , the second section of the page is called " Google Analytics " . Where it says " Google Analytics account " , paste your tracking I 'd . <p> The former helps you see how many pages Google is indexing , how many search impressions your website is getting , if you have any crawl errors- and more . The latter is meant to help you see the performance of your Adwords campaigns . <p> In order to link your Google Webmaster Tools account with your Google Analytics one , you first need to have an account open with the former . If you have n't , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . <p> Once you have an account open , go to the Google Webmaster Tools website I linked before .

Two of those tasks are creating goals and funnels . <p> Goals basically help you track when a visitor does a " conversion " . That conversion can be almost anything , from email signups , to purchases , there are countless of actions you can track . There are four main types of goals : <p> Destination : These goals happen when a visitor lands on a given page , like a " thank you " page . These are the most commonly used , and the ones we are going to use next . <p> Duration : As the name suggest , these goals trigger when a visitor spends a certain amount of time on a page . <p> Pages/Screens per session : This goal is triggered when a visitor visits a certain number of pages on a session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Events let you track pretty much anything you want- since they are triggered when an action defined as an event happens . For instance , you can define clicking a social media button as an event , which you then can use it as a goal . <p> To create a goal , go to Admin &gt; View &gt; Goals . <p> Then , click the " + New Goal " button . <p> You will see a lot of options , which may confuse you at first . Just scroll down to the part where it says " Custom " , and click it . Then click " Continue " . <p> Now you need to give your goals a name . Choose something simple and easy to understand . In this case , well use " Checkout Complete " . Keep the " Goal slot I 'd " as it is , and then choose the " Destination " type .

@@12738601 @1338601/ <p> Starting an online business is always an exciting time in any entrepreneur 's professional life . Having your own eCommerce store is an amazing opportunity to earn some money and gain financial freedom , but there are a lot of mistakes that you can get into , especially when you 're new to eCommerce and do n't have much experience . <p> While its true that you can always learn from your mistakes , I think you 'll agree that it 's better not to make them in the first place and be well on your way to online business success . Here are the 8 mistakes to steer clear of when starting your online business . <h> Mistake #1 : Having no business plan <p> A business plan empowers you to understand what your online store- is all about . You ca n't please everyone in eCommerce , so it 's best to understand what target audience your products appeal to , and market it to them . <p> Do n't think you need an overly formal plan that 's pages and pages long . Simply determine who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 's willing to pay , what your cash flow is like , and how long it 'll last . <p> When you have these basics well-understood and in place , your chances of succeeding with your eCommerce store greatly increase . <h> Mistake #2 : Having a really bad webhost that you ca n't rely on <p> On the Internet , time is money , and the failure to always have a site that 's online means lost revenue . Your customers will be shopping at any time of the day . If it 's nighttime in one time zone , your customer overseas may well be shopping in the morning or afternoon " and they want a working site . <p> To make sure that your store is served by a reliable webhost , research before committing to one provider , so you understand what hosting is appropriate for an eCommerce store . For instance , if you sell many products or expect high traffic , then you 'll do best with a dedicated server or VPS . The last thing you want is traffic spikes causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern if you 're hosted on one of the eCommerce platforms like Shopify . <h> Mistake #3 : Neglecting good customer service on the site <p> Although you 're selling on the web and do n't see your customers face-to-face , that does n't mean that your customer service does n't have to be top-notch . In fact , customer service should be even better than in a regular store since so much of eCommerce transactions revolve around trust and your store 's reputation . <p> Good customer service means that you have your store 's contact info prominently displayed , so your customers can always reach you with feedback , questions or complaints . Phone number and email are necessary . Businesses lose as much as $41 billion a year from bad customer service : do n't let yours join those notorious ranks . <h> Mistake #4 : Failure to do research to see who else is in your market <p> You ca n't have a successful eCommerce store if you do n't know who your biggest competitors are . This relates to so many issues . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is selling something similar , but selling it a lot cheaper than you . Similarly , what happens if the competition 's products are perceived to be better than yours or they already have a big lead on you in the demographic you want to target ? What then ? <p> Knowing all of this before you open your online store will help you greatly , so you can plan your marketing around what your competition is doing , too . <h> Mistake #5 : Doing every little thing to save money <p> It 's understandable that you 'd want to do everything yourself when you start out with your online business , but that should only be up to a point . If you 're doing everything yourself " like obsessing over your logo design or your business cards " then you 're doing something terribly wrong . <p> When you free yourself up from these menial tasks , you can focus on the really important aspects of running your business ! <h> Mistake #6 : Failure to develop a unique value/selling proposition <p> What 's a unique value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of your product that differentiates it from your competitors ' and persuades people to buy your product instead . It is crucial to define USP before you start your eCommerce store . <p> With so many eCommerce stores in operation , each one claiming to be better than the other , you have to stand out from such a huge marketplace ! You do this by crafting a unique selling proposition . Maybe it 's that you have free returns , no questions asked . Maybe it 's that you give discounts like no other brand . This is vital , so spend a lot of time thinking about this component . <h> Mistake #7 : Hiring the wrong people too quickly <p> You ca n't do everything yourself , so an effective way to delegate the less important parts of your business is by hiring people . For example , you can hire people to be your liaisons with vendors , but problems can arise if those you hire do n't share your vision or understand what your products are all about . <p> Then , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to fire them , which is awkward and a waste of productivity . Instead of wasting the time hiring people who just want jobs but are n't passionate about your brand , do n't hire just anyone . Make sure it 's people who are as passionate about your online operation as you are . <h> Mistake #8 : Taking for granted how much work and effort you have to put in <p> Do n't underestimate how much work and effort you have to invest in your new online business , especially when you 're just trying to get it off the ground . Work-life balance is going to be elusive when you first open your online doors , but that 's alright . <p> To avoid becoming one of those infamous statistics " where the majority of businesses that start end up failing " you 'll have to do a lot to make it work . That means working long days and possibly even into your weekends . If you love your eCommerce dream and want it to succeed , though , you 'll gladly do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online business is hard . Are you ready ? <p> It 's notoriously hard to start a business , as the majority fail in their first few years . But now you know the things to avoid , so your chances are looking a little better . <p> Hopefully , you 've learnt something with our list of the worst mistakes to make . So get out there , and make your online store a smashing success !

@@12738616 @1338616/ <p> Your product page is one of the most important pages on your website . Learning how to create a great product page will help convert browsers into buyers . It 'll also help give your customers the information they need to make an informed purchase . There are many ways to present product information to an audience . In this article , you 'll learn what to include on your product page . You 'll also see examples of different product pages so you can better understand what works well and what does n't . <h> Writing the Perfect Product Description <p> According to Nielsen Norman Group , the most effective product descriptions are scannable , concise , and objective . This type of content was shown to improve usability by 124% . <p> To create scannable content , you should include short bullet points in your product descriptions for easy reading . Concise content is 1-4 sentences describing the product . Objective content describes the product honestly rather than exaggerating benefits . <p> In the first example , there 's too much unnecessary information . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to keep manually changing the product descriptions for all products accordingly . <p> In the second example , there are three sentences . The first sentence describes the product in a neutral way using some of the bullet points supplied by Oberlo . Feminine replaced the Gender : Women ' point . Next , two sentences were written to describe outfit pairings . This allows the potential customer to envision an outfit for the blouse they 're looking at . <p> Like the second example , you can choose to remove several bullet points if they seem redundant . Also , if you want to create a consistent brand you might choose to organize all product page bullet points in the same way . In fashion , you might always have the fabric first and so forth . <h> Choosing Perfect Product Images <p> The great thing about Oberlo is that it imports product photos for you . However , you should always import high quality images to your store . If a picture is low quality or does n't represent the product well , it can negatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported images , remove logos from product images in PhotoShop . If your product was shot on a grey background , remove the background to make it white . Try to have a consistent look of product images on your website . <p> Next , having multiple images showcasing different angles always works great on a product page . Customers enjoy being able to see all angles of a product . For example , knowing what the front and back of a top looks like helps customers see what they 're buying . In addition , it 's always great to allow customers to add their own product pages in the review section . It allows your customers to see what they 'll get without the glitz and glam of professional photography . <p> Also , if you sell fashion items such as dresses or shirts , do n't forget to import a size chart image . This allows customers to see measurements and sizes to help them decide on which is the best fit . <p> In addition , having a product image zoom feature allows customers to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your customers to look at a product 's fine details . <p> Notably , if a product has a low resolution but you think it 'd be a great fit for your store . Feel free to purchase the product and take your own professional product photos . <p> Lastly , having a product video can increase conversion rates according to Kissmetrics . According to the blog , site visitors are 64-85% more likely to buy after watching a video on a website . <h> Create a Sense of Urgency <p> According to Conversion XL , you can increase sales by as much as 332% by creating scarcity and a sense of urgency . You can also increase your conversion rate by doing this . <p> Urgency helps turn the casual browser into the right now buyer . When your customers browse your store , a great product will seduce the browser . However , having a sale countdown timer can help encourage the browser to buy right now . <p> Using countdown timer apps like Hurrify by Yousef Khalidi can help create a sense of urgency . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples . Having text that indicates limited quantities can help create scarcity which may help drive sales . However , you can choose to test various different texts to see which increases conversions the most . <h> Ensure Layout is Intuitive <p> Your customer should be able to know how to use your website even if they do n't understand the language . There 's a general ecommerce store layout that your website should follow . Do n't use funky , impractical layouts as it can confuse customers or frustrate them . Keep it simple . <p> Most of the time , the product image is on the left . The product copy is on the right with the Add to Cart button close by and prominent . Make sure your Add to Cart ' button can be clearly seen . <p> When choosing a theme for your store , you should make sure it looks similar to other popular websites in your niche . While many will say stand out from the competition , ' this is generally bad advice when it comes to product page layouts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good example of a product page layout that 's not only familiar to most customers but also includes others features on this list . <h> Test Social Sharing Buttons <p> Social sharing buttons are great for promoting your product page , especially when you have a popular product . Unfortunately , it can also have a negative effect on your conversions . Doing A/B testing on your store will help you determine whether or not it 'll work for you . <p> According to VWO , an ecommerce business split tested social sharing buttons and found an 11.9% increase in call-to-action clickthroughs when removed . They outlined that the social sharing buttons likely do n't convert well when you have no shares on them . <p> In a test by Kuno Creative , when social sharing had over 500 conversions they had a conversion rate of 9% instead of 2% . <p> Thus , if you 're a new store it might be a good idea to remove social sharing buttons . Consider adding them back to your store once you 've built an audience and send large amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if having the icons without specific numbers mentioned works well for your store . <h> Include Shipping Information <p> Mentioning or having an icon indicating free shipping on orders over $75 ' or free shipping within the US ' helps customers get a snapshot of shipping information . <p> By having this succinct information on the product page it prevents the customer from moving off the page to read your shipping information as the essential point is clarified on the product page . <p> Highlighting the requirements of free shipping allows your customer to add more products to their cart if they choose to . <h> Include Customer Reviews <p> Having customer reviews on your product page is essential . If you 're driving traffic to a product page , the reviews on your store can give your customer the extra push towards closing that sale without you doing much work . <p> You can use an app like Product Reviews Addon to automatically contact customers after their purchase for reviews . This will allow you to grow your reviews quickly and with minimal work . <h> Feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this will help with conversions , having recommended products encourage customers to stay on your site a little longer . <p> Often times , you 'll have models wearing more than just the top you 're selling . If you sell the matching skirt or the earrings the model is wearing , having it in your recommended products will help customers complete their look . <p> When it comes to recommended products , avoid having products that look too identical . This can cause a customer to become confused and may result in fewer sales . This is because more choices requires more thinking . <p> For example , you can still cross-sell an item with a similar type of product such as a blouse . However , the blouses need to look different enough from one another to help encourage the sale . Recommending a skirt as a cross-sell that complements that specific blouse can also work really well . It also simplifies the decision as you 're creating an outfit for your customer . <h> Top Brands ' Product Pages + Why We Love It <h> Aldo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very intuitive and clean .

There are also reviews available on the page . The recommended images would 've worked best if there were n't as many with the similar style photography . However , the one on the far right pops well against the similar styles of the other products . <h> Disney Store <p> Why we love it : The Disney Store 's product page is clean . It features shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the product . There 's a review section . The product copy is short , it also features bullet points below the product image .

Delivery information is also available within the product page . The similar products features a similar style of products but with different characters which would pop to someone familiar with the Disney brand . <h> Guess <p> Why we love it : The product page features a very large zoom feature that allows customers to see the fine details of the product image . There are also several pictures showcasing different angles . The recommended products below feature different styles and colors to avoid confusing the customer with their choice . A size chart is available on the product page . Shipping information is also made clear . The product description is short and features two bullet points . The social sharing icons are small , those not distracting the customer . They also do n't detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' button is small but it 's all black color contrasts well against the white background . <p> Hope you enjoyed learning how to create a great product page ?

What are the top countries where people buy from your site ? <p> 3 ) If your fraud filters get alerted when someone buys at your store , how do you decide if that is actually fraud or just a really weird situation that 's not fraud ? What 's your process to decide to ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Keep it simple . Mention US shipping timelines and then provide International shipping timelines . You do n't  need to list every country . You can include a sentence in an email afterwards to reiterate it but you can keep the main format of US and International 2 . It depends on where were running ads at that time . Sometimes UK , Australia , Canada , US. 3 . I contact the customer to get more information . If a customer orders and suddenly emails you to send to a different address , I immediately refund them because most of the time its fraud . I do n't  mind refunding customers if its a medium risk if it seems like it could be , its a lot easier to deal with a loss of a few bucks than a chargeback.

I really want to be able to use Facebook but their stupid security algorithm keeps deactivating my payment methods , even though I 've sent them all kinds of proof of my identity . Google AdWords is expensive but I 'm learning so much about how everything works . I 'm hoping sales become more consistent in the coming months . <h> sabamm <h> babitasharma <h> donteennis <p> Vince Here is a free &amp; pro tip . The reason you keep getting deactivated is because you are using the store URL that was deactivated from your old account on your new account , which , flags that ad account . Thus , you 'd need to create an entirely new store and do n't run ads for 3 months on a new Facebook account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic shit .

You seem to be very knowledgable ? <h> sabamm @qwx196606 <p> Due to the upcoming Christmas craze now everyone is pushing their budgets on FB adverts . <p> The only way to get some reasonably priced conversions is to run all adverts to your lookalike audiences or utilizing your email list . <p> Since showing ads to by retargeting people who already showed interest is cheaper <h> Vince <p> shopifydude Yeah I wish I could tell you what my Facebook ad strategy is but I 've never ran one single ad campaign through Facebook . I 'm still trying to figure out why they keep deactivating all of my payment methods yet never respond with anything besides a generic automated e-mail that says " suspicious activities . " <p> I 've had to use Google AdWords , Pinterest , Reddit , IG , and a little bit of Twitter ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all though ) . <p> Like you , I also have consecutive days where I wo n't get a sale -- like two or three days at the most . They worry me because of my daily spend ( also $20 a day now ) but for some reason , on the third or fourth day I 'll get multiple orders all of a sudden . Or maybe one or two orders in a day with multiple items . I ca n't explain it but like , it gets me out of that rut . Now , I 'd rather these sales be a daily occurrence though but I 'm trying to be patient as well . This past week has been one of my best weeks though , and I attribute it to getting rid of unnecessary broad keyword matches and really zeroing in on search terms , including/excluding each term , etc . I really love this feature for Google AdWords . <p> I 'm getting less traffic , but the traffic I 've been getting I feel are more " interested ( unique ) clicks " than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on people searching for the products I 'm selling . My bounce rate has decreased as well . Different page views and time spent on my site have also increased a bit . I hope this trend continues . I 'm still trying to improve on this though , as well as other things . <h> Peterg <p> shopifydude you need to try and figure out the possible source of your problem .. are you getting engagements on your ads ? Are people actually visiting your store after engaging ? And are they adding to the cart and so on .. give us some more info .. <h> ASP <p> if your not making money what 's the point ? are you all happy lining shopify and oberlos pockets lol <h> shopifydude <p> Peterg People are engaging with my ads .

I 've only been trying Lookalike . Have n't had a chance to retarget . <p> My clicks and Conversion Events ( Add to Cart ) reduced a little and does n't seem to be high quality leads like they used to . Buyers are n't proceeding any further for the past few days . Is it because my budget is too small to reach Facebook 's audience pool of audiences likely to covert and bigger spenders are getting them ? <p> How long should I wait until costs go down again ? Or should I try targeting cheaper countries like South America . <h> shopifydude <h> Peterg <p> shopifydude your reach will be greatly affected during the holidays , especially if you are in a competitive niche . Increasing your budget is the only way to keep up . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want cheap engagements for social proof . Otherwise i stay away ... especially if you want a facebook to find those most closest to your lookalike audience . . . My strategy when starting out with ads now is to run 2 campaigns .. one for clicks and the other for conversion.i do PPE ads but not as much lately because i already have a good look alike audience set up fom previous PPE campaigns .. i may have 3 or 4 adsets per campaing targeting different but comparable audience . With 3 or 4 ads . Usually start with $10 budget per ad ... then i analyyze and kill bad perfomers really quickly and let the promising ones run ... <p> Soo . For lookalike audience you need to set up multiple audiences . Not just one and expect it to be a winner .. try using different sources for your audience creation ... a good way to start out is to run PPE but the key is to put in the comment or in the ad somewhere " would you wear this ? " " Want one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... you get the idea .. the key is to get data .. crucial data for facebook to create your audience that matters ... <p> Alot of people create look alike audience from just visitors to their websites in the last 30 .. 60 .. 90 days ... watever .. that information can be so irrelivant that you are selling womens clothing but facebook will show your ads to men . Trust me , ive seen it ... <p> If you see your competitors ads on facebook , click on the little drop down arrow then click on " why am i seeing this " . You can get some key information there too <h> Vince <p> shopifydude Yeah man , like Peterg , I 'm running a couple of campaigns and each with several adsets . Right now I 'm running them in 3 different specific locations where my niche is most popular in , and adsets are separated by 2-3 different specific and popular items under the umbrella of my overall niche . This seems to be working out fine for me so far . <h> shopifydude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I have insufficient data for my Lookalike to optimize properly . I 'll try your method and run Website Clicks &amp; Conversion with different targeting solely for data collecting purposes ( should I be expecting any sales during this period or will sales come in later after further optimization ? ) . South America has never given me sales , just lots of engagement and silly questions so I 'll be targeting more developed countries . <p> As for the lookalike audience source , what else would it be if not the data captured from my website visitors pixel actions ? For example , I 've tried launching Website Conversion ads for Lookalike Audiences sourced from View Content and Add To Cart . I 've not used other Pixel events because there is n't much data . <p> You mentioned ' Alot of people create look alike audience from just visitors to their websites in the last 30 .. 60 .. 90 days ' . I do n't understand why is this wrong ? This is exactly what I did , create a Custom Audience based on View Content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookalike using that . I then launch ad sets targeting different countries with that created lookalike audience . <h> shopifydude <p> Hey Vince , are you using standard interest targeting or have you already moved on to lookalike audience ? <p> From the information I gathered from you guys , this is what I 'm going to do after hitting reply - <p> 1 ) Launch Website Clicks &amp; Website Conversion ads with different interest targeting at $10 USD a day for each ad set . 2 ) Run for few days , evaluate and kill non-performers 3 ) Create lookalike audience ? Are interest targeting for data collection and sales will come from lookalike later on ? <p> If your strategy is identical to Peterg , then it should be like how I mentioned above . Can you please tell me if that is correct ? <h> bigggggggggg <p> I expect most are n't making anything or hardly anything but do n't post about it because they feel it is their fault for not succeeding .

Furthermore , I 'm concerned because as soon as a product is brought to my payment page the amount will be listed as $X GBP rather than $X USD .

I 'm very confused and do n't want any mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you are using Shopify Payments ( which I assume you are ) Shopify ties the Currency of your Store to the Address set in Settings &gt; General and to the Bank account you link for your deposits .

I would guess you 're implementing email marketing , social media ads on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram , or even a brand new method such as Gmail ads . Whatever ways you 're trying , you need a huge email list as your audience . <p> Why is a growing email list imperative to the long-term success of an online business ? Reaching out to customers to actively sell is vital , running ads to sell on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram where customers gather for social networking is vital , getting bouncedor unhappy customers back via personalized follow-up emails is vital too . Basically , without catching their contact information , you will lose visitors who enter your site for the first time and leave . <p> Below are ten creative ways to double your email list month over month . Nothing complicated , nothing too costly , these are just successful strategies many online businesses use to grow their email lists . <p> Perhaps the easiest and most widely used in eCommerce is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The color and text font in the heading bar should be well designed so it looks like a natural part of your website . <p> What drives whether customers will sign up via the heading bar is the text copy . Make sure your copy delivers a clear , compelling message with values attractive enough to make customers want to sign up and subscribe . <h> Turn visitors into email subscribers with coupon pop-ups <p> An alternative and even more effective form of action request to website visitors is a coupon pop-up . When visitors first visit your store , you can trigger a beautiful welcome coupon pop-up that offers an exclusive discount coupon if they subscribe . <p> Appearing right in the front of a web-page , pop-ups are better at catching a visitor 's attention than static forms . Plus , while static forms can not be turned off , pop-ups give customers a choice to turn them off if they do n't want to be disrupted while exploring the site . <p> Make sure your coupon pop-ups are responsive on all mobile devices as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from mobile . <h> Ask for email in checkout step <p> You 've probably been advised how making the checkout process as simple as possible and giving customers an option to checkout without registering will boost conversion rates . <p> Although that 's true , you can still collect a lot of emails from people who reach your checkout page by adding a field to ask for their email there . How can you still ask for email in checkout step while keeping it simple ? Make it an optional choice , and offer them a benefit if they submit their email such as receiving an e-receipt , faster shipping , free gift or discount code . <h> Run exit intent pop-ups to capture bouncing away visitors <p> 68% of online shoppers abandon their order from the cart page and never come back . You 're literally losing sales from 68% of potential customers on cart pages . <p> If you already have their emails , you can send cart-recovery follow-up messages to convince them to come back . But what if the leaving customers are brand new visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exit intent pop-ups are a good way to go . When customers are about to leave the site , a pop-up will be triggered to prevent customers from exiting by offering a special deal attractive enough to make customer stay and finish their order . <p> Even if customers do not finish their purchase , they may subscribe to your list or follow you on social media , which means you capture their contact info and can recover their abandoned cart later via email or social marketing . <p> Another great idea to collect email leads and even motivate purchases at the same time is loyalty point-based programs . <p> As a kind of reward to motivate customers to take an action , you give away points according to which actions they take . Submitting emails or creating an account are both easy and quick actions to earn points on the loyalty program . <p> If you are focusing on growing your email list , consider giving away lots of points to encourage your customers to submit their email or create an account with your store . <h> Live-chat box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also collect emails from customers who are interested in your products by implementing a live chat box on your site . <p> Based on specific customer behaviors , you can trigger the chat to pop up in the corner , asking if customers need any help . When the agent is offline , the chat may require customers to email so you can reach out to them later with answers to their questions . <h> Offer valuable content such as free eBooks/tutorials <p> These days , people are increasingly skeptical when being asked for email subscriptions on the Internet , unless you can show how they will be receiving real value from the action . <p> If you 're running an online store that sells kitchen gadgets , why notoffer a free eBook of recipes in exchange for their email ? <p> This is a nice example of asking for customer 's email in exchange for a valuable eBook : <p> Make sure you understand what your potential customers need , and provide real value in the free eBooks or tutorials . <p> Whether you write the eBooks/tutorials yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Amazon , it 's an up-front investment that can be used forever to convert interested visitors into email subscribers for your store . <h> Referral campaign : a smart way to multiple email leads at a time <p> As a good source of traffic , referral marketing multiplies traffic from current visitors . <p> What you can do is design a referral campaign , in which customers can refer your **26;707;TOOLONG to their friends in order to get rewards . <p> Normally , each referrer will have a unique link to share with friends . Once a referral clicks on the link and enters their email to participate , you 've successfully collected an email lead !

The prices change back to what they were when I first imported them to my shop from Oberlo . I will give an example : <p> I import a necklace that costs $9 from AliExpress into Oberlo <p> In the Oberlo app , I have set a pricing rule that products under $20 will have $10 added onto their Aliexpress pricing . SO the default pricing in the Oberlo app will be $19 . <p> I change this to $30 and import it into my Shopify store <p> a day or two later I notice that the price of the product has changed to $19 on my store . <p> This has happened for about 20 products on my store ( but not all of products - only some of them ! ) . No matter how many times I change them , after a few days I notice that bam ! they are back to this other price . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a Shopify issue ?

The problem being that I was ignorant . <h> M4857 <p> Why did the prices change automatically in the first place ? <h> gjsk234 <p> M4857 It is to maintain your margin , I presume . So if your AliExpress supplier increases the product price then your profits wo n't be screwed over . That can be super helpful . <p> It 's not a particularly useful feature for me , because I have I do n't have uniform price margins for my products . A $5 unique niche product can be increased in price a lot more than a $5 generic product . I am happy there is an easy option to disable it .

@@12738635 @1338635/ <h> Blog <p> What are responsive icons ? ! You might wonder . Although the responsive web is an absolute norm right now and the first responsive icons appeared a couple of years ago , not everybody knows what they are . The fact that they are not so widely spread these days raises a few questions . Are they really necessary ? Do they provide good user experience ? In today 's article we will analyze pros and cons of such icons , as well as what you should have in mind when creating them . <h> What are responsive icons ? <p> First things first , responsive icons , just like the responsive web , react and change depending on what screen size you 're using to look at them . To put it simple , it 's a set of usually 2 to 4 different variations of the same icon . Basically , what changes is the amount of details used in the icon . When your screen gets smaller , the icon loses some of its details . <p> But why are responsive icons so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icons in their career knows that if the icon looks good on 128px grid , it wo n't always look as good on 32px . It requires a lot of skill to create an icon that will look equally good in different sizes and will still deliver the message clearly . And this is where the responsive icons step in . You take one icon and create different variations of it to look good in different resolutions . <p> So , implementing responsive icons is a little bit like cheating to make them look good in different resolutions and screen sizes . The best way to understand how they work is to see responsive icons in action yourself . Check out this cool presentation : http : //responsiveicons.co.uk/ ( resize your browser window to see the changes ) <p> There are a lot of different opinions on responsive icons . Sometimes changing icons is really not the best idea for user experience purposes . On the other hand , if the icon gets unrecognisable in the small size it 's even worse ! <p> Considering that the first responsive icon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet that widely used , demonstrates that it 's not that necessary to have them . Or at least , you do n't have to use them the way showed in the presentation above . <p> Nevertheless , I think creating different size variations for the same icon can be a true lifesaver ! I often design multiple-sized icons when I know I 'll be using them in different situations as a representation of the same item . For example : bigger , more detailed icon in for the Features page , and small 16+16 version of the same icon for the Menu . <h> How to create a good responsive set ? <p> There are a few things to keep in mind when designing a responsive icon set . <p> 1 ) Icons must look super consistent in style . There is enough stress for a user to open a mobile version of a webpage they used to scroll on the desktop in the first place . And this leads to a really bad user experience if one of the icons a user was familiar with suddenly changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this transition as smooth and simple as possible . An icon should slightly change maintaining all the colours , style and the feel of its bigger brother . <p> 2 ) Always start working from the smallest icon . The smallest icons are the most difficult to create , that is why you need to start from them . Adding details to the icon is way easier than removing them . It 's especially important if your smallest icons are going to be 16x16px . Designing them is really difficult , so you should definitely do them first . <p> 3 ) It is usually unnecessary to have many different steps . In most cases , 2-3 are just enough . <h> What is the future of responsive icons ? <p> To be honest , when I saw responsive icons for the first time I was amazed . I thought they were the future of icon design . But the more I worked on icons , the more I understood that responsive icons would never take over . Do n't get me wrong , sometimes they are very useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And whatever the case , I think every icon designer should have knowledge and experience of creating responsive icons . However , have in mind that it will probably never become a worldwide established norm for icon design .

@@12738662 @1338662/ <p> I 've asked some for clarification , but have not yet heard back from them about this policy . Has anyone had any experience with this ? Does it mean they will only ship purchases to the address attached to the credit card used to make the purchase ? If this is the case , its going to completely push drop shippers out of the those sellers . There are a number of products within my niche that now contain this making it harder and harder to find products . <h> internetmoneys <p> I have noticed this as well ever since we started in February . I spoke to one supplier about it and they said basically that whatever platform they use syncs their product descriptions to aliexpress and many other channels , more specifically ebay , and ebay or paypal has some kind of policy where they can only ship to the buyers credit card address . <p> Anyway the TL:DR is that you should check with your supplier but I was satisfied with the answer above and it made sense to me so I stopped worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fill or refund/cancel an order based on this . 
@@12738663 @1338663/ <h> Aliexpress Order &amp; Payment Issues <h> chrislewis <p> Over the last few days I 've been having some constant issues with ordering where the " security issues " message shows up asking you to send in an appeal . I 've opened different accounts and used a different card on my latest Aliexpress account but still face the same problem - even now when I try and click on the ' Appeal ' link , the page just shows an error , it say 's " The system is busy . Please try again later " ( I 've tried this in different browsers , devices and cleared my cache , nothing works ) . I feel like all accounts are linked because I 've used 2 of the same cards on them and also perhaps my IP has been blacklisted . I 'm in a predicament as I 've got outstanding orders that need fulfilling . <p> Just to give you a bit of a backstory to this ; i set up an account back in November 2015 processing orders myself and then I hired a VA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year I let her go but she started using the same account with a different client using different cards , this obviously set off some red flags . Now because I 've used my current cards on that account I feel like I 've left a trail of security concerns and now Aliexpress either do n't let me pay for orders ( individually or in bulk ) or they go through the verification process but then get close them due to security issues . <p> What next steps can I take here ? <p> I 'm considering getting a virtual IP address , a new card and new account to see if I can start afresh . Your help and advice would be greatly appreciated . <h> luckysump <p> Based on your story , get a new account and buy AliPocket . Do n't bother trying to do it with your card because you will just get nailed every time with these bogus appeals . Ali has the worst security mechanisms . I have gone through appeal , and then tried to reorder the same item after passing appeal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much useless . I 've even go to the point where I used a person who spoke Mandarin to try and talk with them and they still were clueless. <h> teezecrost <p> My payment was rejected . The email came along with a link to appeal . The appeal link does absolutely nothing but tell me the system is busy ; for several days ! This is even before I even try to submit anything . Customer service gave me the email address " **25;766;TOOLONG " to submit my info to instead . And when I say " info " we 're talking sensitive personal banking info etc . That was early this morning and no word back yet . I 'm not super confident I 'll hear anything . I guess my drop ship customer is SOL . Might as well close down my store if this is how it 's going to be . <h> teezecrost <p> I just got off support again , and now this agent tells me I did n't need to submit an appeal , and that the agent who told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to use a different payment method . So I need to apply for a new credit card to use in place of my perfectly good one ? How do I know this wo n't just happen again ? I do n't expect answers from Oberlo , but I wanted to write of my experience on here so others know they 're not alone . I do not see my store going forward built on a system like this . Regardless , thanks for your response !

@@12738670 @1338670/ <p> If you 're selling clothes online then you 'll need to make sure that your customers understand the sizing of your products this is critical when you 're trying to run a successful ecommerce business . When your customers receive products which are the incorrect size you 'll need to deal with refunds , returns , and customer complaints . This adds more work to running your ecommerce business , so you should try to avoid it as much as possible . Sizing issues generally occur when ecommerce entrepreneurs source clothing from one region , like Asia , and sell said clothing to customers who are familiar with clothing sizes from a different region . If you 're an ecommerce entrepreneur who is running a clothing store then it 's imperative that you know how to convert Asian sizes to US sizes . This may sound like a daunting prospect , but do n't worry we 've created this article to equip ecommerce entrepreneurs with all the knowledge that they need to successfully convert clothing from Asian sizes to US sizes <h> What Is Size Conversion ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's critical that you 're aware of size conversion and the benefits which it will bring to your business . Unfortunately , there are n't universal sizing guidelines in place for clothing , which is why size conversion is essential . As an example , Asian clothing is generally smaller fitting than the clothing which you 'll find from American or European retailers , so you 'll need to bare this in mind when you 're sourcing your products . This means that you may need to convert the sizing of your products into the correct measurements for your audience , especially if you 're sourcing your clothing from Asia . <h> Why Should I Convert the Sizes of My Products ? <p> When a customer purchases a product from your ecommerce store they have certain expectations from you , as the store owner .

You can avoid this confusion by converting the Asian sizes to US sizes on your online store this way your customers will be able to order the correct size products easily . <h> How to Convert Asian Sizes to US Sizes <p> If you 're an ecommerce entrepreneur who is sourcing your store 's products from Asian countries and selling them to American customers then you 'll need to know how to convert Asian sizes to US sizes .

If they can provide you with the sizing chart then you 'll find that converting your products from Asian sizes to US sizes is a simple and easy process . <p> If you 're using AliExpress to source products for your ecommerce store then you 'll find that the majority of sellers will be happy to provide you with a sizing guide for their products .

@@12738677 @1338677/ <p> You know customers love it , but should you offer free shipping ? In this article , I 'll detail when you should offer it and when you should n't . I 'll also provide suggestions on things you should conside <p> r before you offer free shipping , some interesting shipping stats , and more . <h> When should you offer free shipping <p> You 've calculated the costs and can afford to To answer the ultimate question should you offer free shipping , ' you 'll be required to do some math . With AliExpress , you can search products based on whether or not they offer free shipping . However , the standard free shipping often takes months to reach a customer which is bad for customer service . <p> Sometimes , the supplier offers ePacket which may not be free but has a low cost . If the product is affordable , you can tack on the ePacket price and offer free shipping to your customers . In the image below ePacket costs $2.20 and the item costs $2.58/piece . You could charge $24.99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend money on advertising , pay for the cost of goods and make a profit while at an affordable price for the customer . <p> Before using Oberlo , I used another dropshipper where the cost of shipping was higher than the cost of goods but not sustainable . For example , the goods cost roughly $8 and international shipping cost $16 . This brings the total cost of goods to $24 . Then when you add in the cost to acquire a customer via ads the cost is even higher . However , the market value of a standard mug , the product I was trying to sell , is nowhere near that price . Many buy mugs from Walmart or the dollar store for under $5 . It was n't sustainable or profitable to offer free shipping in this situation . <p> When free ePacket shipping is offered by supplier If the supplier offers free ePacket shipping , you should offer free shipping to your customers . It 's unethical to charge for shipping when you 're not paying for shipping costs . If ePacket shipping costs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should offer free shipping to your customers as it would be affordable enough to include shipping in the product cost . <p> Many AliExpress products offer free ePacket . You can choose to only add products to your store with this delivery method . Keep in mind that ePacket is only for a select number of countries . Typically , when ePacket is free it 's for the United States with low shipping costs available for other countries like Canada , Australia , the UK and more . <p> Your competitors offer it If other brands in your niche are offering free shipping , you should offer it to stay competitive . However , even if they do n't offer free shipping , you might be able to have a competitive edge over competitors if you do . <p> According to AdWeek , 81% of shoppers research before buying a product . They 'll also browse three stores before making that purchase . Do n't make the mistake of thinking that you do n't have any competitors , because potential customers can easily find them . Remember : everyone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay more for your product if you offer free shipping and a competitor does n't but has a slightly lower product cost . Surprise fees can also increase abandoned carts . <p> Browse several ecommerce websites in your niche . If most of them offer free shipping , you 're going to have to do it too . <p> Let 's look at these two popular Canadian fashion brands . The two brands share a similar audience and their products are within the same price range . Both offer conditional free shipping . Suzy Shier offers free shipping on orders over $100 but offers a free blanket for online purchases . Dynamite offers free shipping on all orders over $50 . <p> While free gifts are always nice , the offer presented does n't appeal to everyone . Most people shopping for apparel would be interested in buying earrings or shoes but a blanket can be a bit of a stretch . Take into the account that the blanket is worth $25 , the cost of free shipping is still higher at Suzy Shier than at Dynamite . Someone wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dynamite to buy a gift rather than Suzy Shier to avoid the shipping costs . <p> You want to increase your number of orders Offering free shipping betters your odds of building a bigger customer base and having a higher volume of orders . With conditional shipping , you may be more likely to have a higher average order value ( AOV ) . However , you can also increase your AOV with free shipping by having upsells or free gift with purchase of two ' offers . <p> When you offer free shipping , your product and price need to be exactly what the customer is looking for to make the purchase . If your product seems attractive to a customer and it 's at a fair price , you 'll be more likely to get a sale . <p> When dropshipping with AliExpress , you can also benefit from increased profits . Since many of the goods are low cost and shipping is either free or low cost as well , you 're in an advantageous position to generate a higher revenue and profit than if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted product costs to accommodate free shipping If you need to pay for ePacket shipping , you can easily include the shipping cost into your product cost to avoid affecting your margins . By incorporating the shipping cost into your product cost , you 'll still be able to generate a profit , while paying AliExpress ' costs , paying for advertising costs and any other associated fees . <p> With AliExpress , you can easily bundle the prices ( cost of goods + shipping fees ) without giving the customer sticker shock . Sticker shock is essentially when a customer is shocked by a high price or a drastically increased price . <h> When should n't you offer free shipping <p> You 're trying to increase AOV so you need to set a threshold You should n't offer free shipping when your focus is on increasing the average order value ( AOV ) in your ecommerce store . For example , if the products you sell are very affordable for customers , you might want to encourage people to buy more products so you can have a higher profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a catch . The customer must spend a certain amount of money before they can access free shipping . You 'll need to experiment to see what works best for your store . However , common thresholds include $25 , $35 , $50 and $100 . <p> Keep in mind that you should also test to see if you make more profit with one of the conditional free shipping offers or with free shipping on all products . <p> When you have low product margins If you 're dropshipping with AliExpress , you should n't have a problem with low product margins unless you 're charging too little for products . <p> However , if you 're dropshipping with an American dropshipping company , you may run into the issue where your margins are n't sustainable . In this case , offering free shipping to your customers can put your business in debt . Even if you were to increase your product prices to be able to offer free shipping , customers may find your product cost too high and not buy altogether . <p> Many print-on-demand dropshipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free shipping to their customer . Store owners would need to offer a conditional free shipping but the cost of goods may already be too high for a customer . <p> You want to use it as a promotional tool You should n't offer free shipping to your customers if you plan on using it- as a promotional tool . For example , if you offer free shipping year round you ca n't tell customers free shipping this weekend only ' to lure them in . <p> Another case where you might use free shipping as a promotional tool is if you have a loyalty rewards program where only loyal customers get free shipping . Amazon does this with Amazon Prime allowing customers to get free same day shipping if they sign up for their membership . <p> When customers get used to getting free shipping year round they need to be lured in to buy products for another reason such as a buy one get one free sale or a steep discount on a product collection . <p> When the shipping costs are too high Another time when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too high . Fortunately , with AliExpress , the shipping costs are typically only a couple of dollars , if there 's any cost at all . <p> However , outside of AliExpress , many entrepreneurs or dropshippers may have high shipping costs that make it impossible to offer free shipping . Sometimes , even offering conditional free shipping is difficult . For example , if a store offers free shipping on orders over $100 ' often times it 's due to expensive shipping costs . <p> Shipping costs are also typically high when they 're delivered in a short timeframe . For example , when products are delivered within 7 days they 're often express which increases the cost . With AliExpress ' ePacket , it takes up to 30 days for a product to arrive which drastically lowers the shipping cost . <p> If a business were to guarantee shipping within a week , their shipping costs would be too high to sustain the business . <p> You offer free returns instead Some store owners may choose to offer free returns instead of free shipping . Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of returns is always going to be lower than the number of purchases . <p> However , offering free returns is especially appealing to those who buy apparel and other fashion related items . The biggest disadvantage to buying clothes online is you wo n't know how it 'll fit or look on you . <p> According to CNBC , offering customers free returns can help boost sales by 357% . The article continues by mentioning that customers are also more likely to spend on a store that offers free returns . So instead of investing in free shipping , some store owners may choose to offer free returns to their customers . <p> Things to Consider Before You Offer Free Shipping <p> Where are most of your customers located ? For example , if you 're using ePacket and most of your customers are in the United States AliExpress is a good match due to affordable shipping and fast delivery times . If you 're using an American dropshipper and most customers are in Europe or Canada shipping costs may be high and delivery may be long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to run the numbers to ensure your product price is sustainable for your business . If shipping costs are n't free is your business able to afford them with your profit . <p> Will you still be able to make a profit after all costs are considered ? There are several financial factors to take into account when offering free shipping . Does your product price give you the freedom to hire a team , pay business expenses , pay the cost of goods , pay taxes , cover the cost of advertising and free shipping . After all those costs are paid is your business still making money . <p> How will you use free shipping as a marketing tool ? Think of your long-term marketing strategy . Do you want to use free shipping year round or during certain times of the year such as holidays and sales . Determine your goals : increasing average order value , increasing number of orders , increasing number of return customers , increasing profit , etc . <p> Should You Offer Free Shipping Statistics and Resources <p> According toRed Door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as free shipping on orders over $75 ' they were able to increase orders by 90% . <p> According to Marketing Land , they found that 9 out of 10 customers were incentivized to do their shopping online when offered free shipping . They also found that about a third of of online shoppers were making purchases weekly . <p> Thanks to ShivarWeb , you can now use this handy Free Shipping &amp; Profit Calculator to help you determine whether or not your store should offer free shipping . <p> According to David Bell , people find a free shipping offer that saves them $6.99 more appealing to them than a product discount of $10 despite saving more money with the latter option . <h> What do top brands do for shipping ? <p> Now that you have some insight on whether or not you should offer free shipping , let 's take a look at what other brands do when it comes to shipping . Do top brands offer free shipping , conditional shipping or paid shipping ? <p> Walmart offers conditional shipping . Customers only qualify for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this to increase the average order value since many items on Walmart 's online store are very affordable . <p> Best Buy offers free shipping for special events . For the holiday season , they offer free shipping on all orders . Since many of the items on their online store are expensive they likely have high margins and can afford to offer free shipping . They may also do this to boost sales during the holiday season and return to paid shipping the rest of the year , using it as a marketing tool . <p> ASOS offers conditional free shipping . International customers who spend -22.56 or more can enjoy free shipping . This likely helps reduce shipping costs as shipping internationally usually costs more than shipping within your own country when you carry inventory . <p> Ralph Lauren offers free shipping when customers use a discount code . Also , they take it up a notch by offering free gift boxes during the holiday season to customers which is a nice little bonus . <p> Disney offers promotional free shipping to customers . With a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any product . They use it- as a marketing tool . <h> How to know whether you should offer free shipping , a free shipping threshold or paid shipping <p> The best way to answer the question Should you offer free shipping ? ' is to test it on your store . Until you look at data from your store 's customers , you wo n't really know whether or not to offer free shipping . <p> Unfortunately , you ca n't run a multivariate or A/B split test for shipping on Shopify . However , the easiest way to find out if free shipping or conditional free shipping works best on your store is to try one condition for a couple weeks and compare it to another condition shortly after . <p> For example , you offer free shipping on all products and run an experiment until you reach 100 customers . Once you hit 100 customers , you can run a second test where you offer free shipping on orders over $35 ( or whatever number makes the most sense for your store ) and you collect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A/B tests can be easily done in Google Analytics but performing this sort of test on Shopify ca n't be easily done so a manual test would have to be done . <p> Should you offer free shipping on your store ? Let us know what has worked best for you in the comments below ! @qwx196608 @qwx196607 @qwx196611 <p> Marcos Rodriguez <p> Since my products are relatively cheap even after mark up I think i am going to do conditional free shipping as to increase AOV . Great article breaks down everything into simple chunks . <p> Iris Reyes <p> Hi Nicole , my name is Iris and am building my first online store right now . I have a question about pricing items . I am at a loss as to how high I can go and still be fair . Like , I am looking at necklaces/chokers for women . Some are listed as low as .83 cents . It is a beautiful necklace that looks like it should be worth way more . What made me think about that was your example above about the shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could charge somewhere in the 20s , what made you decide on that price ? Help <p> ibraheem khan <p> Epacket <p> So when the customers see that it will take almost a month to get the product will they still buy ? <p> addy80 <p> but facebook started ban if we run add Free+Shipping <p> Nicole <p> Hi Iris , I 'm definitely not an expert at pricing products . I kind of just play it by ear . I often price products based on physical stores that sell similar types of products . Look up other sites in your niche . What do they typically price their products at . You probably cant pull off high end designer prices , especially if you paid .83 cents . However , for chokers you can probably price between 19.99 and 27.99 and still get sales , depending on look/price/quality ( does it have high order volume and high reviews with photos ) . <p> Nicole <p> Thanks Marcos ! I 've actually been thinking about switching over to conditional free shipping for the same reason too . Also , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app . I use free gifts on the Shopify app store . Our AOV increased like crazy because of it . <p> Nicole <p> Yup ! But for the record , it does n't  always take a month to get the product . I 've actually manually checked and some customers get their products within a week and a half depending on supplier . Most people outside the US are not used to same day shipping so waiting a couple of weeks is normal for them . <p> Nicole <p> Sometimes people get banned on Facebook for reasons they do n't  expect . There 's a lot of misinformation for what Facebook bans . You can contact Facebook directly to find out if you can run Free + Shipping ads . If Facebook confirms that they ban these types of ads , you can offer free + shipping as an upsell or have it on your store without running ads directly to those products . <p> I dropshipped a product off Aliexpress and its taking FOREVER to get delivered . I have n't been able to get a tracking update since December 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , and I do n't  blame them . Ive been using Oberlo with AE since I opened my store as its really convenient , but how do you deal with these ridiculous shipping times , plus customer complaints , when dropshipping from China ? <p> Nicole <p> Are you making sure all of your products are being shipped with ePacket ? For my store , I intentionally do n't  add products that do n't  have epacket shipping . Also , make sure that the sellers ship with ePacket after the fact . If you have to find another supplier for the product , then do that . I find for me in general it was a bit rockier in the first couple of months while we were figuring out who was best to work with . However , now we seldomly run into issues and items get delivered pretty quickly . Some of my customers get their products within a week and a half . The good news is that you can always find a better supplier for the exact same product . Make sure the products you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures ) as its already been tested by other dropshippers and customers . Its worked well for me . <p> Shaker <p> Hi Nicole , Great Article . Couple of questions for you : <p> 1 ) How do you deal with shipping when shipping for a product has really cheap rates shipping to the states , but that same product from the same store does n't  have epackets for for another country ( ex. canada ) thus they are charging really high rates for decent shipping time frames ? Do you just not carry the product ? Carry it and if someone from Canada orders it just refund them ? Or something else ? <p> 2 ) How long do you quote shipping times to be ( since different countries have different time frames . And on aliexpress they you have to wait a max of 50-60 days before you can talk about it failing to arrive ) ? Do you say its 15 30 to business days and just leave it at that ? <p> 3 ) Returns : What happens if for example you were selling womens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its great but after a month or so its starts showing tears , not through their fault but the quality is bad . <p> A month after arrival would aliexpress accept returns or not ? How long would you have as a return period in your store from when your customer recieved the product ? <p> Ex . Product can only be returned for a refund in 30 days after the customer has recieved the product , not after that . <p> GSotelo <p> With dropshipping , when the products get delivered to the buyer , do they come with a receipt that shows what was actually paid for the products ? <p> Nicole <p> You can leave a note with the supplier for every order ( I send an automated message ) that says Im dropshipping products and ask the supplier not to leave any flyers or receipts . Its worked well for me . <p> Nicole <p> Hey Shaker , Thanks for the feedback . 1 . If certain products do n't  have ePacket for countries outside the US , do n't  target other countries for ads for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . I usually do check before I import products if ePacket is available for Canada , Australia , UK . However , a couple of our ads , we only target US because ePacket is n't available outside of it . 2 . Since most people target US you can have your website stating Shipping to the US takes X days , international orders may take up to x days. Most people are used to the US being the main country and theyll know every other country is international . 3 . In that specific example , I would probably cover the cost myself , refund the customer if its passed the AliExpress refund deadline . Do it for your customers sake to have a good relationship with them . Also , check the product reviews on AliExpress for that clothing item if there are few or negative reviews it might actually be a bad product . If you get other similar negative reviews , remove the product from your store . Keep in mind this is what I would do , however , its ultimately your decision . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm planning to do free shipping initially to see how well it converts . <p> 1 ) Makes sense . I wo n't target ads to people in countries where that specific product does n't  ship with epackets . <p> But What happens if I target a product at a canadian audience because it has epacket shipping there . They come to my store and love , so they decide to look around . They find a product that does n't  ship epacket and purchase it . What would you do then ? <p> 2 ) Regarding shipping time frames I just followed what it said in the starter ebook. 15-30 busines days . Should I leave it at that or think about breaking it into two categories for usa and international ? <p> 3 ) What countries have you found in your experiance are more likely to have epacket shipping ? <p> Thanks <p> Nicole <p> Hey Shaker , 1 . That 's definitely a possible scenario . In that case I would contact the supplier to see if they can offer ePacket for that order if I pay them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via standard shipping and let the customer know there might be a delay with one of their items . 2 . Its up to you . There are several different ways you can present the information . 3 . The ePacket list keeps growing . Some countries include : USA , Australia , UK , Canada , France , Russia , Israel , Saudi Arabia , Ukraine , Norway , Germany , Brazil , Hong Kong , Korea , Singapore , Malaysia , Austria , Belgium , Switzerland , Denmark , Finland , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , New Zealand , Poland , Portugal , Sweden , Turkey and Mexico . Keep in mind which country has ePacket depends on the individual supplier so youd have to check individually to know if you tend to target certain countries . Hope that helps ! Nicole <p> Shaker <p> Hey Nicole , <p> Thank you for taking the time to answer my question . These questions have been literally keeping me . This information is really helpful . <p> 1 ) In your experience have you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ( if they did n't  originally have an epacket option for that country ) if you paid them a little bit more ? If so how much do they ask for ? Is it a really crazy amount or a more managable amount of money ? <p> 2 ) Before you choose a supplier do you get in touch with them and ask them questions ? If so what type of questions fo you ask to vet them and see if they are good suppliers ? <p> 3 ) Before choosing a supplier do you ever explictly ask them if they do dropshipping or do you just order from them and just tell them you 're " dropshipping and to not include the invoice " ? <p> Thanks , Shaker <p> Nicole <p> Hey Shaker , No problem ! 1 . I 'm not too sure . Youd probably just cover the cost of shipping which should n't be more than a couple of dollars . 2 . I do n't  normally contact suppliers before importing their products . I usually look at order volume , reviews , check photo reviews of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the case that we have an issue with a supplier , I 'll find another supplier who offers the same product . There 's almost always another supplier selling the same product . 3 . They all do dropshipping . However , I leave a note telling them that I 'm dropshipping and not to include marketing materials or invoices for every order . <p> Shaker <p> How do you make sure that sellers shipped with epackets after the fact ? <p> Shaker <p> Hey Nicole , <p> 1 ) Now that you 've been at this for a while do you have any perks that suppliers give you ( ie you get cheaper shipping , prices , priority when they get an order from you , etc ? ) <p> 2 ) I 'm assuming that january is going to be slow for retail ( with people having spent all that money on the holidays ) . When do people get back to buying stuff ? When does retail start to pick up again ? <p> Its epacket . Its the first and only order I 've had since I opened my store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refund it . <p> Nicole <p> Hey Shaker , 1 . We have been offered cheaper prices and the ability to go through them directly . However , its more work to dropship via each supplier directly so we decided against that . 2 . Do n't  make assumptions . I thought sales would slow down after Christmas and we had one of our highest sale days on Christmas Day . It also depends on your niche . Is your niche seasonal , if so there may be slow periods . However , if people buy your type of products year round the sales will keep coming . We 've had one really slow day this week but the other days have all been our average . If you present the right offer to the right person at the right time theyll buy . <p> Nicole <p> Wait for the customer to contact you for the refund . In the meantime , contact the supplier to ask for a status update . For one of my first stores , my first sale was a refund . Refunds happen . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me know . <p> No problem . Just do n't  give up . The reason why I ended up making money from stores is because when a store was failing I 'd pivot . If a niche is n't working out trying a broader niche . If a supplier is n't working out , try a different supplier . If print on demand is n't working try AliExpress . Good luck with your store ! And happy new year Tim ! <p> Shaker <p> Hi Nicole , <p> Great point about making assumptions . I try to catch myself but sometimes they just slip through . <p> 1 ) Chinese New Years is coming up . I do n't  know if you have any experience with it , but what should we expect ? ( Are they going to close down , or shut down , or will it be business as usual ? When do they open ? How much longer will the shipping cycles be because of CNY ? ) <p> 2 ) How do you prepare for the slow down so that customers do n't  freak out ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import your products from china ? <p> Nicole <p> Hey Shaker , 1-2 . I 'll write an article about Chinese New Year to answer your question about that . 3 . I do n't  mention that we import from China 4 . I might not mention where the clothes are made in the event that it was made in a neighbouring country and not China as not all suppliers are based in China . However , if a customer contacted to ask where it was made I 'd tell them . 5 . I would mention all of the items as having the combination of materials would result in a different feel . For example , most leggings are n't  made of 100% cotton . <p> Shaker <p> Hi Nicole , <p> Looking forward to reading the peice about cny = <p> 1 . Do you mention that your products are imported at all on the website ? 2 . For #5 if you sell clothing or an accessory and aliexpress says that its made of Spandex , Cotton , Polyester , etc . How would you phrase the materials its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me an example of how you would write it ? 3 . Regarding the fact that shipping is longer than usual how do you phrase that on your website ? I know you mentioned say " shipping to us takes X days , international is x days " but do you say anything about why its longer ? Or do you just say it takes x days and leave it at that ? <p> 1 ) If you have apparels and accessories where they have many product variations do you use the same product description for all the variations ( while only changing the color , and size etc ) Ex . A denim shirt has the description " Long-sleeved shirt in soft washed denim with press-studs down the front and flap chest pockets with a press-stud . " <p> if you had this shirt with two other variation would you use the same product description ? Change the description for each ? Or just tweak it ? ( ive heard google may penalize for search if there is too much repetition ) <p> 2 ) What information do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaker <p> Nicole <p> Usually if there are product variations there 's only one product page for it . I 'll write an article about what to have on a product page for you . <p> Fortis <p> Hi addy , I do n't  think Facebook bans because of Free+Shipping . The ban may be for other reasons which are not obvious until you contact Facebook. e.g running ad on prohibited items or selling branded items without permission . I have run Free+Shipping ads very recently without being banned . <p> What do you mean print on demand ? The only reason I 'm using AE is because its the only dropshipper available through the Oberlo app . They definitely work great together , its just the long delivery times that is causing problems . I ended up refunding my customer after my supplier simply told me the product got lost . That 's all she could tell me , and this was a supplier with a good rating on AE . Are there other dropshippers available through Oberlo or is it only AE ? Thanks . <p> Nicole <p> It was just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on demand but the margins were really slim so I pivoted by using Oberlo and did AliExpress dropshipping . It can be frustrating to have products lost in transit . However , its not that common for the most part . My store did 719 orders last month and we had about 15 refunds . Refunds are part of running a store . I think you just got unlucky with it being your first order . Right now , its mostly AliExpress suppliers . There are a lot of great suppliers on the platform I 'm really picky about the products I import into my store . I look for really high order volume , really high number of product reviews , has a really visually appealing picture , I even check to see if there are customer picture reviews of the product so I can know what a customer will receive . Try running ads to different products to see what converts best for you . Sometimes the product you almost did n't  even import into your store becomes the best-seller . <p> Demsy <p> Hi Nicole , thank u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question about what u said " If you 're dropshipping with AliExpress , you should n't have a problem with low product margins unless you 're charging too little for products " <p> how if someone sell a product similar to mine with very small margin ? because in my research i found many popular products in ebay are sold with so small margin n those seller usually from hongkong/ china . should i avoid selling these products ? 
@@12738679 @1338679/ <p> Landing pages are designed with a single purpose in mind : to convert visitors into solid leads and buyers . Good design of your eCommerce landing page will lead to more conversions , more sales , and more profit . <p> In eCommerce , an overall conversion rate of 1% is considered average . <p> By investing the time and resources needed to optimize your current eCommerce landing page , you might be able to double or triple your revenue with the existing traffic you get to your website . <p> If you already have eCommerce landing pages designed , then the tips and tricks in this article will help you to optimize your store to drive more conversions that will turn into leads or direct sales . <h> Craft catchy headlines <p> The headline is one of the first things visitors are going to see . Make sure its big , bold and easy to read . Take an example from Nike . Their campaign landing page has a simple yet powerful message you ca n't miss . This approach may not work with lesser-known products , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand out and get the attention of potential customers . <h> Use stunning imagery <p> A compelling headline combined with stunning imagery taps into the emotional side of your customer in ways that will light a burning desire in them to take action . Powerful images can be worth many thousands of words . <p> Usability tests by Jakob Nielsen prove that people pay a lot of attention to pictures . When talking about people , photos of real people get lots of attention while overly-staged stock photos are mostly ignored . <h> Use lots of negative space <p> Negative space , often referred to as white space , is the space around and between the elements of a page or image . Using negative space helps build hierarchy , clean up the layout and draw attention to certain elements of the landing page . <p> Increase the spacing in your current landing pages and do n't  be scared to leave space in your layout as it will dramatically improve the emphasis on the headline , product image or call-to-action button . Just take a look at the Oculus Rift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize the product and call-to-action button . <h> Write concise copy <p> Get the length of your product page copy just right . Do n't  overwhelm your potential customers with unnecessary information . If needed , utilize icons to illustrate your copy and make it easier for people to quickly scan . An excellent example of concise copy with iconography can be seen on the Fitbit Surge landing page . <p> When writing your copy use : <p> Short sentences <p> Bullet points <p> Benefits over features <h> Ensure consistency in your sales funnel <p> If your visitor heard about you on Twitter , Facebook or via email , keep that story and conversation going . People will feel connected and wo n't question the process as they might if you talk about one thing in an email and then another thing on your landing page . This may cause confusion and cost you a customer . <h> A/B test everything <p> A/B testing is a test of comparing two versions ( A and B ) of a page to see which one performs better . You compare two versions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one that performs better wins . It is crucial to engage A/B testing all the time to ensure ongoing optimization . <p> Many people struggle to come up with ideas about what to test . Below are some examples you can test to improve your conversion rate . Its worth mentioning that you need enough data to determine which version performs better . Showing one or the other version to only 10 people wont provide you the more solid stats as you 'll get from 1,000 visitors . <h> Tools to boost your eCommerce landing page conversion rate <h> Optimize for mobile <p> According to the research conducted by Statista in 2018 , 39% of all retail eCommerce is expected to be generated via mCommerce ( mobile commerce ) . This should come as no surprise since we already know that the number of mobile Internet users surpassed desktop users in 2014 and continues growing every day . <p> In- 2018 , 39% of all retail eCommerce is expected to be generated via mCommerce . <p> The user experience on mobile is more important than on desktop . Short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for websites to load , and certainly wo n't bother using those not optimized for mobile devices . <p> Make sure your eCommerce landing page mobile version is simplified . Increase the size of fonts and call-to-action buttons so people can quickly read and tap on the screen . Forget all the fancy sliders and other effects as it only makes your website heavier and can lead to lost business . <p> You cant afford to ignore mobile traffic as Google says that " more Google searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries including the US and Japan . " <p> Test your landing page on various devices and use Googles Insights Tool to discover how you can enhance your stores mobile experience . <h> High contrast call-to-action <p> Call-to-action ( CTA ) is one of the most important elements of your landing page . Whether you 're trying to capture an email address in order to market to the lead with your email sequence or you want to try making a direct sale , your CTA button is the single most important thing your visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size , color and high contrast . It needs to pop . In the example below , you can see how Made.com is using a live countdown timer to encourage visitors to click on a bright yellow CTA button . <p> Avoid generic language such as " click here . " Use power words in your CTA button copy . Choose " my " instead of " your . " CTA is also useful for creating urgency , so add words like " now " or " do n't  miss . " <p> Its a good practice to repeat your CTA button . Include it above the fold area , then after each and every section that adds credibility . Put it after product description , features , reviews , and testimonials areas and in the footer as the last opportunity to capture the visitor . <h> Reduce complexity <p> Its easy to add more content and make things more complex . The more important and more difficult task is to take things away and leave only the essentials . Try using fewer form fields instead of asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big time investments and seek instant gratification . Long and complicated forms do n't  inspire potential customers to spend time and fill out all the generic data you think you need . <p> " Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication . " " Leonardo da Vinci <p> Ask for only the absolute minimum from your visitor and you 'll see increased conversions . Instead of asking for the first time visitor to tell you their name , surname , address and email , try to ask only their name and email . That way you do n't  scare them with too large a time investment , which can lose you potential customers because of their laziness . <p> Of course , its impossible to please everyone , and this is especially true in online business . Keep your focus narrow and provide the best thing in the world to a small audience . Your landing page should be appealing to your audience and provide what is essential , leaving all the other elements for other landing pages . <p> People are impatient , so speed up your landing page by using Pingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even get reports when your site is down so you can take action . <h> Create urgency <p> Fear of missing out ( FOMO ) is one of the primary drivers of consumer behavior today . It helps explain why otherwise sane people will queue up and live on the street for days just to be among the first to buy the latest electronic gadget . <p> Creating urgency on your website can help you increase conversions . Combine social proof and real data from your store to leverage the FOMO of your customers into taking immediate action . <p> A new tool called Fomo will help you to do exactly what I described above . It will pull data from your store and show latest transactions , reviews and other actions in real time to increase trust and inspire action . <h> Highlight social proof <p> People are social animals . They need to feel safe making one or the other decision . If your customers discover something new , they instantly seek for verification from someone familiar , such as a friend , thought leader , or respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company logos to raise the level of confidence by being associated with well-known and trustworthy brands . <p> Below are persuasive social proof elements you can use : <p> Customer reviews <p> Product recommendations <p> Awards <p> Guarantee seals <p> Third-party security certifications <p> Awards are hard to get and wont apply to every product or store , but make sure to use them whenever you can as people like to be winners and buy only the best products . A perfect example can be seen below on the Beats Studio Wireless headphones product page where an award badge is taking up lots of space and is easily noticeable due to vivid gold color . <p> If you have no awards to show off , consider implementing brands such as Visa , MasterCard , and Shopify for payments , and if you have been featured in any media outlets , list the logos of the companies and add a simple " As seen in " copy to create a sense of being trustworthy because of these affiliations . <h> Sum up <p> The key takeaway from this article is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors to see , do and buy .

@@12738681 @1338681/ <h> Jay <p> Hey Tomas , <p> Awesome guides and i just finished reading all of them . <p> But with regards to the ads , should you be targeting really broadly and then using the results as your next audience ? I was planning on doing 3 ads with a spend of $5 per day for a week and then changing it week by week to try and improve the results . @qwx196609 <p> I always suggest using custom audiences and lookalikes . In my experience , it 's the best targeting option for eCommerce . <p> If your budgets are small , try narrowing down your audience as much as you can . If you had bigger budgets , you could use broad audiences and let Facebook optimize the targeting . <p> E.g. you tell Facebook to optimize your campaigns for clicks and target 1M users : Facebook will show that ad to your audience and will learn what type of people clicks on that ad . Then it will optimize it and narrow down your initial audience to the people who are most likely to click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you have only a $5-20 budget , you will probably receive up to 20-40 clicks a day , and Facebook will not have enough data to optimize the campaigns for you . <h> TimKing <p> What Tomas has said , and aim for an audience of between 75,000 and 300,000 to start with . Start with $5 per ad and let it run for 3 days then review the data . <h> Jay <p> Hmm for someone whose in the women 's accessory/jewelry niche .. how exactly would you go about this targeting ? It 's such a broad category and I 'm not sure if i should be doing city specific in my country , or a country as a whole , etc . Even when I filter down the interests to women 's fashion/accessories , it does n't really reduce the size of the audience either . <p> How would you narrow this down ? <p> Thank you so much ! ! @qwx196609 <p> Jay Try creating a niche audience instead of offering a niche product . A niche category for jewelry could be single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites like Wanelo , Pinterest and Polyvore ( women , age 22-24 , single , Wanelo , Pinterest , Polyvore ) . <p> You could narrow down by selecting targeting rules . By default it 's interested in any of these topics : Wanelo or Pinterest or Polyvore , but you could show ads to people who like all of them interested in WaneloandPinterest or PolyvoreandPinterest . Screenshot : http : //take.ms/V6V2d <p> If this one ai n't successful , try another audience the other day . <h> FarhatGodil <p> TomasSlimas I tried this combination for my jewelry store but did n't get much clicks hardly 3 and that too at the rate of $4.5 . Do you have any other pointers for targeting for jewelry . <h> SharynSee <p> This is great , thanks , have run one campaign on FB , lots of views , added 51 likes to my page and one sale and about 2000 views . <h> Josh <p> Advertising to a niche audience works , but so does advertising broad . Niche advertising can get faster results , but also limits how quickly you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ad will be able to run longer . <p> If you test your ad against a smaller niche audience and get some sales , then take that ad ad test it against broader audiences as well . If something is working , do more of it . <p> I say this to every new advertiser : LEARN TO WRITE BETTER ADS . <p> Seriously . <p> Ad copy is your biggest leverage point . Everything hinges on your ad copy . Conversion rates , sales volume , everything starts with the ad . I review ads as a favor from time to time and quite often they are just bad . <p> Thing is , its not hard to write good ads . The fastest ( and best IMO ) way to upgrade your brain is to read good advertising books . There are plenty of amazing books on writing better ads . Do a search on amazon.com for books on direct response ad copy , or ask me - I have a top favorites list of books I have read on the subject . <p> If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ad is good , or you will reach a lot of people without making a profit . Personally I find making hyper-targeted , niche audiences to be a lot of work . You can make a profit doing that for sure . But my personal preference is to advertise something a lot of people want that I can mark-up the price of significantly . <p> One other thing that is VERY important : It is far better to make a bigger margin and be able to afford to pay more for advertising , than to to sell a super cheap product and struggle because your ads are costing too much to make a profit . <p> Bigger margins = more cash available to spend on advertising - which means more sales volume and more money in the bank . <h> Tools4work <p> Josh Hey Josh , thanks for sharing your insights on Facebook targeting ! If targeting a broad audience with a " Clicks to Website " ad , how big do you think the daily budget should be , for Facebook having enough data to optimize the ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run this ad , before Facebook has gained some solid data ? <h> Josh <p> For broad targeting , I would definitely optimize for conversions rather than website clicks . To mitigate risk , I would start with $5/per day if you do n't have a big budget since I want to let these ads run for at least a week , if not more before scrapping the ad . <p> Here 's a real world example based on an ad I started on Sept. 21st where I am selling sunglasses : <p> Targeting : USA only , Male only , 45+ , Mobile Newsfeed only ( always turn audience network OFF ) . Audience size is over 14,000,000 . I based the targeting criteria off of data I gathered from prior ads . <p> Here 's the most recent ad data as of September 26th : Click through rate : 2.83% Cost per click : $0.61 Clicks so far : 77 Sales : 4 - though note that one of those sales included 3 variations of the glasses . Amount spent on ads : 47.17 Revenue : $83.90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break even than I would like but I 'm getting sales already which is a good sign . For now I 'm going to keep them running to see how well Facebook optimizes them . <p> I 'm also going to raise the price on the sunglasses once I get a few more sales to increase profitability . I had initially priced these glasses low to see what I would get for a conversion rate , but I have a different set of glasses selling at a higher price point so it should n't hurt conversions to up the margin . <p> The answer to your question , with regard to guidelines , really depends on your product price IMO . My guideline is to spend up to 2x the price of your product on an ad , unless the product price us upwards of $100 or more . It is a higher priced item then spend up to 50% of the product price . Those are the guidelines I tend to stick to . If you do n't have any sales after spending $50 or so I would pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that your first ads for a product are , in my experience , rarely profitable . It takes some work to figure out how to sell a product profitably . With that in mind , really dig into the data you buy . Do n't let your ad spend go to waste , as there is always things you can learn from that data . <p> Look at age , gender , device , anything and everything you can glean . People will tell you that , but take it a step further and determine why people responded that way to your ads . Then do tests to prove that hypothesis , Do n't test things at random , r because people tell you to . Formulate your own tests to continue improving ad performance . <p> Ask : " Why are people 45 and older more interested in my sunglasses that other age groups ? Maybe it is because those specific sunglasses bring back memories of their childhood . " Now write your ads using that angle . You may need to do more than one test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test everything intelligently . <p> Working smarter and harder is what makes the difference . <h> Tools4work <p> Awesome Josh - one last question - when optimizing for conversions , do you optimize for " Add to Cart " or " Initiate Checkout " ?

BUT I just do n't like using Shopify as much as WooCommerce/WordPress because I am an expert in using WooCommerce/WordPress ( I have built over 400 sites ) but feel seriously retarded when in comes to Shopify .... lol basically because I have only built 2 sites using Shopify and it is very different from WP and for some crazy reason I seem to keep running into weird issues with Shopify that takes a specialist over there to have figure it out every time .... like things that should not even be issues like the shipping charges ... it will randomly try to charge customers like $45 for shipping when it should only be $9 for shipping ..... and this just happening out of no where 2 days ago and I have not touched anything and they triple checked everything on the settings that I have done and it looks perfect ? ... plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google and they actually had to hand write the code for my site to make it work for dynamic remarketing ( going through my Google Analytics account code instead of my Adwords account ) &amp; conversion tracking on my Shopify site ? ? ? So crazy ! I have never even had to call Google to make anything work on any of my sites before I used Shopify ... <p> Anyways sorry about the rant there ... lol The fantastic news is that I have had ZERO issues with your incredible app and I am just hoping and praying that you build a plugin soon to work for WooCommerce before I end up going completely grey from stressing out with the bugs with Shopify 's platform . @qwx196609 <p> I personally came from Magento and I really love Shopify . It 's super simple and intuitive . I 've been using it for the last two years and have never had any issues besides core customization . <p> We will build the WooCommerce integration before the end of this summer .

Anyway , we 'll send a newsletter to all our current users . <h> JKeitsuSorenson <p> JewelryDiary I had that shipping calculation issue too maybe two weeks back all of a sudden when they updated their shipping rules . After hours of trying to figure it out with customer support they were unable too ... but I found that it 's actually the shipping box rules in the shipping section . Let 's say you had the " sample box " there , now it automatically requires the shipping box to be part of the shipping calculation . Set the weight to 0 instead of the default . Fixed ! <h> Bella <p> JewelryDiary LOL Jewel , you made me laugh when you wrote that you feel retarded using Shopify ! HAHAHA I feel you . I feel exactly the same way as you . Shopify is really easy and intuitive as compared to Woocommerce/Wordpress , but nothing can compare Wordpress even though it was hard and complicated when I first started using this platform . <p> I forced myself to create a store on Shopify because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely regret it ! It 's not Oberlo 's plugin 's fault . It 's Shopify 's platform itself ! I wasted 2 months of my time and effort with my Shopify store and on top of that their $29 per month , but seriously , I do n't care about the money , what I care the most is the service and its basic features ( e.g : SEO and sitemaps ) . <p> Shopify 's sitemap is poorly generated ! ! I 've had issues with their sitemap . It 's not indexing most of my products and it has been fluctuating on and off . <p> Shopify 's sitemap is nothing like WordPress . I 've never had issues with my WordPress 's sitemaps and I 've built at least 4 different sites using WordPress/woocommerce and it only takes 2-3 weeks for all our product pages to get indexed on google . <p> I am unfortunately closing the shop from Shopify because they 're not very helpful about the issues with my sitemap . I followed their instructions clearly and yet they ca n't even fix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Oberlo . Thomas , please , release the Oberlo woocommerce plugin ASAP so I can continue my dropshipping journey with woocommerce . <p> Thank you ! ! <h> yalgaar007 <p> TomasSlimas I also need WooCommerce Oberlo plugin . I migrated my website to shopify just for the sake of oberlo . <h> CarlEvans <h> CarleenP <p> I too would really love a woocomerce solution . I design sites for Wordpress and woocomerce and that is my huge preference . I 'm not a big shopify fan . I do n't hate it , but I would much , much prefer to use woocomerce . I have been thinking of trying Oberlo , but have been hesitant in part because I do n't really want to have a shopify site and in part because of the closed orders reports . If this were available as a Wordpress/woocomerce option , I definitely would buy it . So , an update on where that is in development would be great !

Also , is it important to have a lot of content and likes on the page you are advertising with ? Or is it irrelevant ? @qwx196609 <h> PauliusMelkunas <p> Hey , Dylan , <p> I suggest you not to Boost Post , but create ads with Power Editor . <p> Boosting posts will do no good for you , because automatically it 's a Page Post Engagement ( so it is optimised on getting likes , comments and shares , not a visits to your website or conversions on the website ) ad that Facebook creates for you . Also no detailed targeting options for you . <p> Moreover , placement is also set automatically . You must use pixel , because that 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you choose . So , if you 're choosing Clicks to Website objective , Facebook will analyse information from your pixel and will optimise and show your ad to those , who are the most likely to click on your ad and go to your website . <p> In e-commerce is good if you have resources to generate content which engages with your audience and in this way you can create some kind of a relationship with your customers . But in the beginning the most important thing is to find the right audience that will be the most interested in your products and finding that product ( products ) which is converting super good , so a lot of testing coming your way . 
@@12738688 @1338688/ <p> Most entrepreneurs fall into two key categories : dropshipping vs affiliate marketing . Dropshipping is when the manufacturer carries the inventory and ships it to the customer on your behalf . In dropshipping , you set your own product prices and are responsible for marketing . Similarly , in affiliate marketing the merchant also carries inventory and ships the product . However , while you 're still responsible for marketing , you do n't get to set the product price and only receive a commission . In this article , we 'll explain the pros and cons of dropshipping and affiliate marketing to help you determine which is more profitable . <h> Drop shipping Vs Affiliate Marketing : Similarities <p> While dropshipping vs affiliate marketing have many differences , they also have quite a few similarities . <p> Both allow you to start a business without requiring inventory or shipping goods <p> Both are relatively low risk business models <p> Both have high earning potentials <p> Both are easy to start working on immediately <p> Both require similar skillsets such as the ability to create ads , drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both businesses can be started for a relatively low price <p> Let 's look at the pros and cons of both starting a dropshipping and affiliate marketing business . <p> No cost for being an affiliate When running an affiliate marketing business , the costs are generally quite low . There 's usually no fee for the affiliate to pay as the merchant usually covers administrative fees on affiliate networks like Clickbank or Amazon Associates . The only costs that an affiliate typically pays for are their own website and server keeping costs low . However , as an affiliate marketer , you 're required to pay for the marketing costs as you 're the person driving traffic to the merchant 's website . Yet , as it is a business expense , you 'll likely be able to write it off during tax season . Overall , the costs for being an affiliate marketer is quite low . <p> Excellent source of passive income An affiliate marketing business is an excellent source of passive income . There 's a bit of upfront work to figure out your ads or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that 's done you can have ads running in the background while you make money . You do n't have to worry about creating a product . You do n't have to worry about shipping a product . All you need to do is make sure you 're sending highly targeted traffic to the merchant 's landing page to ensure a conversion . <p> No customer support to worry about In an affiliate marketing business , the affiliate supplies the merchant with their leads . Thus , you 're not necessarily the product expert . As a result , the merchant handles all customer support issues . If the customer is n't satisfied with their product , the merchant handles the refund . If a customer needs help with a specific aspect , the merchant is responsible for helping them . Thus , when it comes to customer inquiries all you need to do is direct customers to the merchant . <p> You only make a percentage of every sale When doing a comparison between dropshipping vs affiliate marketing , the biggest disadvantage of affiliate marketing is that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 in ads only to make $50 back in commission fees . The payout for affiliate commissions is generally a lot lower than dropshipping . Even if your commissions are several hundred dollars , odds are the cost of the product is higher which means finding the right people will cost more as well . Also , you do n't have the opportunity to set the price . For example , if people are interested in the product but feel the cost is too high , you ca n't lower it to meet the demand of your audience . In addition , since you ca n't set the price of your earnings , you 'll likely make a lot less than if you were the merchant yourself . <p> Payments may be delayed In the battle between dropshipping vs affiliate marketing , an affiliate marketing business may have difficulty managing finances as some merchants may be unreliable with their payment deposits . There are many great affiliate programs that make payments on time . Yet , sometimes , one of the companies you 've chosen to be an affiliate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the process of closing down or declaring bankruptcy while an affiliate is hard at work trying to make their commissions . In the event that a merchant declares bankruptcy , the affiliate marketing business loses the money spent on ads while also not receiving their commissions . <p> People can remove the affiliate link Sometimes , if you do n't use a link shortener , people can hover over the link and see that it 's an affiliate link . As a result , they may assume that it costs more to buy through the link not understanding that you only receive a commission . Thus , people may choose to manually go to the website you 're recommending directly without clicking your affiliate link . Since they did n't click on the link , the merchant gets to make 100% of the profit . Thus , making your marketing efforts less successful . Many people are skeptical or dislike affiliate marketers . They feel like they 're being scammed , even when the truth is they 're not . It can be hard to convince people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In some countries , you need to disclose to your audience that the links you 're providing are affiliate links . Thus , making it even easier for a person to avoid clicking the actual link . <h> Dropshipping Vs Affiliate Marketing : Dropshipping Pros <p> Dropshipping is a low risk business model When comparing dropshipping vs affiliate marketing , dropshipping tends to be a little less risky in various ways . First , like an affiliate marketing business , dropshipping does n't carry inventory nor does it ship goods . This makes both models pretty low risk . However , with dropshipping , the risk is even lower as your funds become available each week . With an affiliate marketing business , there may be thresholds you need to reach before you can cash out your first cheque . For example , if you 're an Amazon affiliate outside of the US , you can only be paid by cheque or gift card . However , to receive the cheque you must have made at least $100 . Yet , not everyone succeeds at making $100 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get paid what you made . <p> Dropshipping allows you to have high margins When deciding between dropshipping vs affiliate marketing consider how much money you can actually make . The commissions in an affiliate marketing business can often be low in comparison to a dropshipping model . When dropshipping on AliExpress you can buy a product that costs $1 and sell it for $19.99 allowing you to keep a substantial portion after marketing costs . With affiliate marketing , commissions are a percentage of the product . Yet , when you factor your percentage , marketing costs and any other expenses , you 're left with a much smaller percentage . When comparing affiliate marketing vs dropshipping , you 'll likely be better off financially as a dropshipper . <p> You 're building an asset When you dropship goods , you 're building an asset your brand . With dropshipping , you 'll have your own professional website . You 'll make enough money to invest in advertising , content and other traffic and money generating techniques . In a year from now , if you decide you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to someone else . However , not all affiliates have their own assets . Some affiliates make their money by creating YouTube videos . Yet , you 're not allowed to sell your YouTube channel . Between dropshipping vs affiliate marketing , you 're better off with dropshipping . <p> You have multiple chances to lure in a customer When dropshipping products , you can easily retarget your audience to help convert the sale . With affiliate marketing , since you 're sending the traffic to another website , you have no control over retargeting . With dropshipping , the traffic comes to your own website . Also , you have control over the optimization of your landing pages , product copy , website design and more . The checkout will also match your website 's branding . As you have more control , you better your odds of attracting a customer and converting them . <h> Dropshipping Vs Affiliate Marketing : Dropshipping Cons <p> You need to manage customer support The main downside to dropshipping is that as the store owner , you 're responsible for customer support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone who specializes in it on Upwork.com for an affordable price . All you need to do is provide guidelines and general responses for the customer support representative to follow . By outsourcing this component , you free your time up to focus on marketing and optimization which allows you to grow your business faster . <h> How can I boost my income as an affiliate marketer ? <p> While we 've been comparing the differences between dropshipping vs affiliate marketing , they share a very similar skillset . Both dropshippers and affiliate marketers excel at generating traffic and marketing . <p> If you 're great at affiliate marketing , there 's no need to stop doing it . It 's about taking your efforts to the next level . The most profitable way to grow as an affiliate marketer is to add a store to your website . For example , if you 're an Amazon affiliate promoting fashion you can add integrate dropshipped goods to your store . <p> Since you already have an audience , adding a store is an easy way to monetize them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store is mostly upfront work of adding products and writing product descriptions . Afterwards , all you need to manage are your orders , marketing and customer service . You can even outsource some of the work to make the workload even lighter . <p> If you 're skeptical about whether or not dropshipping is for you , test it . You can slowly introduce dropshipped goods to your audience by choosing relevant products with high reviews and order volume to ensure best results . <h> Dropshipping vs Affiliate Marketing : Why will running a store will make you more money ? <p> Running an online store makes you more money for the following reasons : <p> You set your own product prices which is higher than affiliate commissions <p> Dropshippers earn far more from physical goods than affiliates do <p> You have a better chance of going viral or having a really successful ad campaign <p> You can have affiliates send YOU traffic when running a store <p> Customers will be more likely to come back to your website to buy more when dropshipping whereas when customers of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to <p> The cost of goods is low ( allowing you to set affordable pricing for customers while having high margins ) <p> The everyday workload is light saving you time ( time is money , of course ) <p> You can build a bigger audience as you 'll be your own brand <p> You know through high order volume and reviews if the product will be an easy sell <h> How to start dropshipping ? <p> Starting a dropshipping business has never been easier , or cheaper .

If you have any questions , let me know ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose ! I have done Affiliate Marketing before but my sites got whacked by Google as they were a bit thin and he got demoted to the 5th page never to return no matter what I tried . The landscape seems a bit different now and I am considering having another try but now Dropshipping with Aliexpress seems he flavour of the month so not sure which to try . <p> Reading your post there does n't  appear a clear winner ! <p> Kind regards Brian <p> Nicole <p> Hey Brian , I actually started out as an Amazon affiliate several years ago . I got penalized for the same reason on one of my websites a board game site . I did n't  make a lot of money it was really early in my career and the margins were bad . Its a hard lesson to learn but it does make you a better entrepreneur . I found that the margins as an affiliate werent really sustainable for me . I got into dropshipping by doing print on demand but once again ran into the same issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins are way better . I 'm also making much more money since my ads are more profitable . I also have room to reinvest my profits into more ads to make even more money . For me the clear winner is AliExpress dropshipping . Dropshipping with AliExpress has been better in terms of order volume , revenue , profit , conversions . That 's my personal experience . <p> Did you follow a course or did you just learn it on your own ? One of my reservations with the Aliexpress model is the shipping time and the issue that sometimes products do n't  turn up ! How do you get around that , do you just state that right up front that is can take up to 60 days for delivery ? <p> Kind regards Brian <p> Nicole <p> Hey Brian , <p> I went to school for PR ( type of marketing ) so AliExpress dropshipping seemed like a natural progression . Ive taken courses in the past for sure though . All of our products ( on my personal store ) are ePacket which has arrived to customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . You can be upfront about how long shipping takes . The issue with products not turning up is n't an AliExpress issue . I recently returned a BeachBody product to another city in my province and they never got the package . It happens . The number of missing packages is actually low in the grand scheme of things . <p> Ive been thinking about both affiliate marketing and drop-ship but just not sure where to start <p> Nicole <p> When I first became an entrepreneur I started as an affiliate marketer with Amazon . I did n't  make much money and I could n't reach the threshold to cash out . It was mostly due to marketing inexperience back then . But also had to do with really thin margins . Eventually , I transitioned into dropshipping via print on demand with Printful again margins were bad . For the past 5 months , I 've been dropshipping via Oberlo and our sales skyrocketed because we had enough profit for us to reinvest back into the business . <p> christian <p> Nicole , Thanks for commenting back . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby Chahal <p> Hi Nicole . First of all , thanks for the detailed article . I have been in blogging since 2015 . As 2 years have been passed , I am looking for something different . Actually I am an adsense niche blogger and not happy till now as the income is not stable . It is all about relying on google everytime . So I started to explore the affiliate thing but that too did n't  work for me . ( May be lack of knowledge or strategy ) . I have been thinking for a drop shipping store . Do you think that it can yield some positive results . I am hard worker too so I can Invest my time in everything ( money too no doubt ) . Can you share the guides which I should before I start for something ? <p> Are you looking for a new niche ? Or are you looking for a new stream of revenue ? If you have a two year old blog with great traffic it might be a good idea to keep it but change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products ? You do n't  have to share your niche with me btw . When it comes to commissions whether from Amazon , Google or other affiliate network , they 're often quite small . Keep in mind marketing is one of the biggest costs so as an affiliate marketer you 're paying for their traffic but only receiving a small percentage back . For me personally , my business started taking off for the first time in three years after I started dropshipping with Oberlo . I know from first hand experience that it is possible to make money with it . I 've tried making money in every way prior to this too Amazon affiliate , writing ebooks , starting blogs , print on demand . But none of them really made much money . If you 're still passionate about your niche and can turn it into a dropshipping store , you 're evolving your business instead of starting from scratch . I would keep your old content if you 're getting organic traffic . I might change the blog layout to make it look more like a store . <p> christian <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could give any advice on how to use Ali-Express . And in your opinion would you use Amazon or Shopify <p> Nicole <p> What specifically do you need help with in terms of AliExpress ? Right now I 'm using Shopify . However , Shopify and Amazon recently partnered and you can add Amazon as a sales channel so I 'm testing that right now . <p> Nice article . Im interested to use Oberlo . Is there any Oberlo plugins that works on WordPress using WooCommerce platform ? <p> Jerry D Prevatt <p> Nicole ; I 'm very interested in dropshipping , however , I find that a lot of products listed by AliExpress are less expensive on eBay . Also , AliExpress has lots of negative feedback in their Facebook comments . I 'm wondering why youre promoting this company with all this negativity ? <p> Nicole <p> Hey Jerry , for your first point . Sometimes the ebay prices are lower because the AliExpress seller is also selling on those channels . Often times , AliExpress sellers ( the manufacturers ) post their products on multiple marketplaces like Amazon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer the best prices so it works well for them . For your second point , its true that there are a lot of negative articles about AliExpress . But you can find negative articles on everything . While I do write for Oberlo , I also own my own Oberlo store where I dropship products from AliExpress . Our refund rate is about 1-1.5% which is actually pretty standard in business . And for the most part , my customers are happy with their products . AliExpress is one of the biggest ecommerce marketplaces and of course there are gon na be bad apples . But for the most part they 're actively trying to remove knockoffs from their marketplace . Also , and I 've experienced this first hand , as a dropshipper on more than one occasion AliExpress has actually taken my side when having issues with suppliers not delivering ePacket when they say they 're going to . So as a store owner , I geniunely see effort on AliExpress part to run an ethical and legal business . <p> DOMENICO PUPILLO <p> Hello , thank you for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dropshipping ws . I only have a doubt : When supplier send the article ordred they will have theyr own pakege . So the costumer will see the chines label and the supplier prize . How to avoid this please ? <p> Sulis Hartati <p> Hithanks for your nice article NicoleI am just looking for such information regarding the dropshipping businessI was just starting this business model by Shopify running in 6 month . I use Oberlo alsoBut til now I got only 7 sales.I used Pinterest as the marketing model even use Buyable Pinbut wondered why I have only little salesCan you please review my websitewhats happened with my website almost the last 3 weeks I got no salesthanks for your support <p> Wes Grasty <p> You might want to consider moving to Shopify . If you have any pain points with WooCommerce , most of them will go away ! <p> Jamila <p> Hi Nicole .. fantastic read . I have been meaning to dropship for a couple years now but havr been afraid that the packaging from China will not match my brand image .. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own labels , thank you notes etc .

Are you looking for entrepreneurs to learn from ? In this article , you 'll learn what is an entrepreneur , how to be an entrepreneur and whether or not entrepreneurship is the right fit for you . <h> What is an Entrepreneur ? <p> An entrepreneur is a person who starts at least one business and takes financial risks to grow the business into something greater than his or herself . In addition to starting the business the entrepreneur leads the business though they 're not always CEO . Early stage entrepreneurs wear many hats . They 'll take on responsibilities ranging from marketing to budgeting to product design . Solopreneurs are one type of entrepreneur . They typically start and run businesses solo , or in other words by themselves . Almost all businesses are started by entrepreneurs . <h> Why Do You Want to Be an Entrepreneur ? <p> It 's important to ask yourself why you want to be an entrepreneur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be business savvy in order to have their business succeed . You might not have a degree in business but you 'll need the qualities and the intuition to understand what the needs of your business are . Do you feel uncomfortable working a 9 to 5 job ? Many entrepreneurs struggle to fit in in a steady 9 to 5 job . You may feel your work ethic is undervalued as you always put in more effort than your colleagues . Your coworkers might think that you 're showing off or sucking up though you know that it 's not the case . You may feel suffocated working a structured job and hours . Perhaps you need more freedom and flexibility in your daily routine . <p> It 's important to ask yourself before diving in whether not not entrepreneurship is going to solve your underlying problem . If you ca n't manage a high volume workload at your 9 to 5 , entrepreneurship might not be the best fit for you as your workload drastically increases as you succeed . If you 're looking for more freedom or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose entrepreneurship because they want the potential to make unlimited amounts of money . Yet , most entrepreneurs running early stage businesses do n't make pocket any money as they consistently reinvest their profits back into their business . Entrepreneurship is more of a long-term game . And if played right , the rewards can be huge . <h> Myers-Briggs and Entrepreneurship <p> Before diving into how to be an entrepreneur , let 's take a look at your personality type and how it plays into your role as an entrepreneur . Myers-Briggs is a professional personality test created by Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers that is now used to understand personality types . Myers-Briggs can tell you what your strong suits are and what your weaknesses are . They often provide guidelines for the types of jobs you 'd succeed in . While some personality types are better suited to entrepreneurship than others , there have been successful entrepreneurs with one of these 16 personality traits . You can complete the Myers-Briggs personality test online for a small fee . <h> How to Be An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Coming up with a business idea is a lot harder than people make it seem . Not because it 's hard to come up with an idea , but because it 's hard to come up with one that 'll be profitable . Focus on creating a business that solves a problem . The more annoying the problem , the more desperate people will be to find a solution to that problem . <p> You can also choose to solve a problem by fighting for a cause . Maybe you 're trying to raise money for a charity or solve a social issue . If you donate a percentage of sales to charity , you can position that the problem you 're trying to solve is the cause you 're fighting for . <p> Another thing you want to consider when coming up with a business idea is how you 'll differentiate yourself from your competitors . Sometimes doing something differently than your competitors , even if you 're selling similar products , helps your brand grow . For example , offering same day shipping , having lower prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package.We recently published a post on the startup business ideas that 'll make you money . If you 're stuck for ideas you can start from our list . <h> How to Be An Entrepreneur Step 2 : Do Market Research <p> Once you come up with a business idea , it 's time to determine if there 's a market for your niche . You can start by looking up other brands in your niche . Do they have a lot of followers and post engagement ? Is their revenue public ? If so , how much are they making ? <p> You also want to determine if there 's a growing market for the niche . You can look up industry statistics on sites like Statista and Statistic Brain . You can also use tools like Google Trends to determine whether there is higher or lower search volume than usual within your niche . <h> How to Be An Entrepreneur Step 3 : Build Your Business <p> In this step , you 'll start creating your business . But , you wo n't do everything to a full-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if you start an online store , you 'll want to have a few products for customers to choose from and to run ads to . You 'll also want to have a contact us page , an about us page and shipping and returns information . It 's also a good idea to include a couple of blog posts to show customers that there is activity on your website . You 'll also want to make sure your homepage is presentable with a visually-appealing banner image , a professional logo and an easy-to-navigate layout . The website needs to be attractive and professional enough to build customer trust to help you land your first few sales in the next stage . <h> How to Be An Entrepreneur Step 4 : Test the Market <p> An important step when learning how to be an entrepreneur is to test the market . If you decide to run an online store , for example , you 'll want to have at least 10 products on your store before you start marketing . You can test the market a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or YouTube within your niche and pay for a shoutout . You 'll need to contact a few different influencers to ensure they 're able to convert their audience . Second , you 'll want to run ads on Facebook . Create a few different ads targeting different audiences and products . You 'll want to run the ads for at least a week to understand which types of ads work best . <h> How to Be An Entrepreneur Step 5 : Evaluate <p> The last step in learning how to be an entrepreneur is to evaluate your results .

So I look up the shopify order on Oberlo and then pull up the Aliexpress order so that I can send a message to the supplier or track the shipment etc . It would be much easier if I had a link to the Aliexpress order or even just the order number to use to look up on Aliexpress in Shopify under order notes or some place like that .. @qwx196606 <p> After you place an order on AliExpress - just go to AliExpress orders page and click on a green sync order details button - http : //take.ms/7puzG <p> As such , your Ali order IDs will be automatically assigned to orders on Oberlo. <h> rcalfor <p> Sorry if I was n't clear .

I just wanted to see if there are any other veterans out there who have reached the scaling ceiling for their first store such as myself .

My thoughts were open up a separate aliexpress account ( because only one person can process orders at a time and only in one account ) . But I somewhat fear that aliexpress may not be okay with having the same billing and cards on file for two different accounts ? Then open a separate business paypal account . <p> Anyone try yet ? <h> amin92 <p> Hello , I have had 3 aliexpress accounts all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never had any issues ( once i got past the order appeal process ) although i can say they were not making much orders per week so your situation with that may be different . Paypal gave me the biggest issues , for example when one account was limited and i had to submit documents for it the other accounts would also end up limited . And they would all state a message such as " resolve issue with account ( my other account email ) " . So i 'd end up with all accounts limited at the same time which can be very annoying . <p> Not sure if this information helps much but thought i 'd share . Also i wanted to ask if you currently offer any consulting , I 've seen your posts on the forums for a while and it sounds like you are doing great .

@@12738711 @1338711/ <h> Ali Express Prices Printed onto packages - solutions ? <h> mitch8910 <p> So I have bought about 20+ products off Ali Express in the past , and they all have a " value " and " weight " section on the packaging . I 'm selling items for $20 on my site that cost $1 on Ali , and the customers are going to see this . Would love to to hear if any successful users of Oberlo have overcome this somehow , or if they have realised it not to be an issue . Would also like to hear any other user 's input , too . <p> Thanks ! @qwx196606 <p> Yes , a supplier might include promotions or a receipt , but you can set up Oberlo to fill in a custom note automatically each time when you 're at the checkout page . As a result , your supplier is notified that you 're drop shipping and wo n't include any information which could be harmful to your business . <h> mitch8910 <p> MantasBeloglavka Thanks for the reply . I did n't know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a problem with you dropshipping their products ? I do n't see an obvious reason why they would as it is more business for them , but I still have concerns . Have you had any messages back or orders not allowed when you tell them you 're dropshipping ? <h> yalgaar007 <p> mitch8910 Most of them will comply with your your request . Here is my note that I attached with my order . <p> Ship products only via ePacket . Please do not send anything ( business card , gift card , invoice , receipt , any message ) other than product with the package.We are an online retailer and honoring these terms will ensure future retail and bulk orders . <h> mitch8910 <h> NickieP5150 <p> Also , for the vendors who state that your ORDER and SHIPPING address much match , these are the ones that tend to close dropship orders . Some of them currently sell on other platforms , and they prefer to limit their competition . Therefore , you can also just put in the notes : Please do not ship with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift . <p> The $ that will show on the envelope still will be for customs purposes only , and it is usually a lot less than even we paid for the item . If customers ask , which they have , I just state that we list the value of the product as a lesser amount so that shipping , taxes , and customs charges are kept low which allows us to offer our products to them at a cheaper price . In my case , I offer free shipping on most products , so I just advise that I would not be able to offer free shipping if I did n't list the value as less . <p> Most customers are very accepting and somewhat appreciative of this kind of response . @qwx196606 <p> Thanks so much for this valuable information - it can be used by many of our fellow drop shippers . <p> Let me know if you have any other great tips <h> NickieP5150 <p> MantasBeloglavka You 're welcome Mantas . I am trying to stay with it and not jump ship . Hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to order in bulk and have my product shipped from a fulfillment center as to avoid this crazy mess . A good to know fact is that there is a company called one dollar fulfillment that is operated by disabled military vets in the US . They will store product for you for FREE for an unlimited amount of time and will only charge $1 to ship each order you receive . That 's my goal . <h> NickieP5150 <p> MantasBeloglavka My latest appeal was approved , and I started ordering again after waiting 24hrs . I ordered and deferred payment and paid in bulk orders of 10 at a time and processed around 20-30 orders per day . I wanted to give the account a little time so I did n't just order 200 orders all at once and potentially lock up and disable my account again somehow . I really think aliexpress is having some site script issues . My only issue remaining is with the security error I receive when using alipocket . I used to only receive it when trying to purchase funds for alipocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , but now I receive the error when trying to USE the funds ! So aggravating . I have over $400 in funds I ca n't seem to use at the moment , but I can use my credit cards just fine .
