@@26069932 @6069932/ <h> Ask a Question <h> Description of Galvanic Isolation <p> Galvanic isolation in power equipment refers to the fact that the output power circuit is electrically and physically isolated from the input power circuit . Electrical isolation is accomplished using an isolation transformer . Physical isolation means that the output power wiring does not touch or connect to the input wiring . <p> All personal computers already have galvanic isolation between the input power and the computer logic built in . This is a requirement of international safety agencies in order to prevent shock hazard . Therefore , the addition of another transformer is redundant . <p> Many people mistakenly believe that galvanic isolation corrects noise on ground ( earth ) wiring . This is not correct . In fact , all galvanic isolation transformers only isolate the power wires , but pass the ground wire straight through . <p> Some UPS systems provide galvanic isolation . Most on-line UPS units do not provide galvanic isolation , despite the widespread misconception that they do . For example , Exide , Unison , and ON-LINE ( Pheonixtec ) on-line models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Oneac does provide galvanic isolation . Therefore , isolation is not a function of the type of UPS , but rather a feature that can be added to any UPS . <p> The actual benefit of installing an isolation transformer is that common mode noise fed to the computer is greatly reduced . Common mode noise can also be reduced by using noise filters , such as in the APC Smart-UPS series . The filters can work as well as the isolation transformer , especially at high frequencies where computers and networks operate . The isolation transformer is better at very low ( audio ) frequencies . <p> Computers and computer peripheral equipment are not affected by audio frequency noise on the power line . Therefore there is no benefit of the isolation transformer over filters for computer applications . The disadvantage of the isolation transformer is the extra heat which shortens UPS battery life if the batteries are in close proximity . Another disadvantage is that the UPS weight dramatically increases with an isolation transformer.

Add in big data and analytics , machine to machine ( M2M ) data and artificial intelligence and you 've pretty much got all of the major technology trends facing us today . So it came as no real surprise that most of these terms were all liberally sprinkled into questions I was asked to field during the recent introduction of StruxureOn in the UK and Ireland . <p> From our point of view , the IoT encompasses all the devices we have in the data center that have built-in intelligence " ones that can actually communicate and be understood by computer software . As with industrial processing and manufacturing , there is a lot of data from which we can gain insights being generated by the physical equipment which pumps , heats , cools and powers the infrastructure supporting the IT load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing analytics on it and creating big data we are bringing more value back to our customers . From what we can see , this is the bigger story in the StruxureOn introduction. - It 's about using data to help customers understand their data centers better ; how they are performing , how efficient they are , how many alarms and incidents and occurrences of incidents that occur over time , how old their equipment is , should I replace components inside IoT devices and so on . It 's about bringing much more in-depth and actionable information to our customers . <p> It seems to me that data analytics are already key to delivering value for customers . However , I believe that we are just scratching the surface in this area . The current StruxureOn offer includes a report to our customers that analyzes their site . We are moving away from analyzing the individual components or devices that sit in the data center and taking a much higher level view of trends and efficiency , and maybe what devices are typically faulty or are emitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding where to focus in order to optimize your data center , rather than just facing one big wall of information . <p> Clearly , StruxureOn follows the cloud model with customers required to do no more than enable a gateway in the data center so that data from the physical environment can be uploaded over an encrypted link ; and then download an app so that insights and alerts can be received using smartphones and tablets . In a recent report , 451 Research have stated that this style of DCIM-based cloud services could potentially be disruptive , transforming manual on-premises approaches into remote , data-driven and ( eventually ) automated ones . <p> Clearly the big trends which affect IT specifically and many vertical sectors generally , are also having an impact on the data center .

@@26070080 @6070080/ <h> The alarming state of electrical safety in many existing residential buildings <p> This is the first post in a 3-part blog series looking at the high level of electrical risks present in many older residential buildings , including a proposed strategy for gradually upgrading the safety of those dwellings . <p> Each year in Europe , 16,000 persons are injured and 540 die due to electrical accidents , with more than 300 of those electrocutions occurring in western Europe . In Switzerland , Electrosuisse considers that the risk of death or injury with an electrical accident is 50 times more likely than with other types of accidents in the home . Beyond the risk of electric shocks , there is also the risk of fire . In Great Britain , the Electrical Safety Roundtable estimates that in 2014 through 2015 , more than 5,600 accidental fires in dwellings were caused by electrical distribution systems . <p> Most of these accidents and fatalities could be avoided if electrical installations complied to the safety requirements . But while electrical installations in new single- and multi-family dwellings are covered by current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally not addressed by those standards . <h> Catching up with safety standards <p> It 's estimated that 85% of dwellings were built before 1990 . These older buildings may comply with the standards that were in place at the time of construction ; however , during the 1990s significant changes took place in electrical standards . Prior to that time , some of today 's protection technologies were not available or required . <p> In addition , there was a massive growth in electrical consumption between the 1970s and 2010s , with a ten-fold increase in appliances per household , doubling consumption per capita in mature countries . This rising demand has put a lot of stress on older electrical systems , especially those where installations may not have been properly maintained or verified . The result is a wide range of potentially dangerous conditions facing owners and tenants . <p> Changes of dwelling usage : numbers of inhabitants , presence of elderly people , young children , disabled persons , illness or even homework may need specific adjustments : such as increased number of socket outlets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are done by an unqualified person . <p> As a matter of facts , older dwellings show many non compliant aspects , such as absence of a protective earthing conductors for socket outlets or the entire dwelling , absence of residual current devices in bathroom or outdoor socket outlets , outlets showing heat damage from overloading , fuses or circuit breakers not properly adapted to the cross-section of conductors , considerable number of extension cords or socket outlet sheared off . <h> Studies reveal a majority of dwellings at risk <p> In recent years , several countries have launched extensive safety studies on existing residential buildings . In Spain , a study of 1500 buildings concluded that 32% of the dwellings were unsafe and 35% were very unsafe . In Germany , a questionnaire to the inhabitants of 1300 buildings concluded that a majority of the electrical installations do not correspond to the current usage of electricity in terms of number of circuits , switches , and socket outlets . In France , a survey of 6000 residential buildings aged more than 15 years found that two-thirds of the dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multi-family buildings , 83% of the buildings showed risks of electrocution . <p> From these studies , it can be logically concluded that the number of electric accident and electrically-related fire recorded each year are in some way a result of the high level of risks present in older existing buildings . This reveals an urgency to raise the level of safety of these buildings to current standards . <p> Fortunately , there are simple steps that can be taken to gradually improve electrical safety through a program of manual safety audits . In our next post , we 'll look more closely at how the application of fundamental safety principles can help better protect existing buildings . 69633 @qwx269633 69634 @qwx269634 69635 @qwx269635 69636 @qwx269636

In a scenario where a 30A circuit breaker is providing power to a 20A rated outlet , the outlet , load plug , load cord and load are rated for 20A use , thus sized for this rating . In this scenario there is inadequate protection for the outlet and all connected equipment , and potentially ( and most harmfully ) the conductor that is supplying the outlets themselves . <p> In North America , Canada , and Europe , PDU 's are evaluated under UL/CSA/EN/IEC 60950-1 .

@@26070135 @6070135/ <h> Recommendations for Hospital Network Connectivity " The Power of PoE <p> My last blog discussed the importance of high capacity network connectivity in healthcare facilities . With internet applications being so ingrained in our everyday lives , hospitals need a network infrastructure that can keep up with patient , staff , and visitor demands " and slow networks can even have catastrophic effects on patient care . Hospital teams need to take into account both current and future needs when considering an IT upgrade or building a new facility from the ground up . At Schneider Electric , we recommend that healthcare facilities adopt Category 6A network cables and connectors . With a transmission capacity of up to 10 gigabits per second , Category 6A cables have the unique capacity to keep up with the data needs of today 's hospitals , ensuring that the hospital can maintain a fast and reliable network connection . More importantly , a hospital that can seamlessly transmit information in today 's digital world is a safer and more efficient one . <p> The other major benefit of adopting Category 6A cables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PoE allows electronic devices to receive both power and data through one Ethernet plug-in . The ability to receive both power and data through one cord means less cabling and less cost for the hospital . With Wi-Fi being more than 18 years old at this point , many are pointing to PoE as the next big thing in network connectivity . <p> PoE is still a developing technology . Right now it only supports 25.5W of electricity , which limits what appliances can be powered over Ethernet " mostly small appliances like laptops and VOIP phones . However , experts predict that by 2017 the PoE standard will jump to 100W of energy , a substantial leap forward . This means that larger pieces of equipment like building automation devices , lighting systems , presence detection systems and HVAC temperature controls can be powered using this technology . Imagine the impact this could have in a hospital setting ? <p> While PoE still wo n't be able to support most medical equipment , it represents a significant increase in capacity .

@@26070141 @6070141/ <h> Specialty Blogs <h> Tips to Maximize the Life Expectancy of Your UPS System <p> UPS batteries have a forecasted lifespan of 3 to 5 years under recommended conditions . But what are these recommended conditions , and just how much do they affect the lifespan of your UPS battery ? Maybe even more importantly , how do you make sure the life of your UPS itself is maximized ? <p> Unit placement , temperature and cycling frequency are three factors that contribute heavily to UPS and battery life expectancies . Following some simple guidelines can help make sure you are getting the most out of your UPS , and maximizing your availability . <p> Unit Placement The UPS should not be placed near open windows or areas that contain high amount of moisture ; and the environment should be free of dust and corrosive fumes . The ventilation openings at the front , side , or rear of the unit must not be blocked in order to provide proper air circulation , and avoid over-heating . <p> Temperature " Most UPSs have a recommended operating temperature , typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while most users probably feel confident they will rarely if ever operate their UPS outside this temperate range , they may not realize that there is actually an optimal recommended temperature . A general rule to remember is that for approximately every 10-C ( 18-F ) above the ambient temperature of 25-C ( 77-F ) , the life of the UPS and its battery will be reduced by 50 percent . <p> Cycling " When a power disruption occurs , the UPS will automatically switch to battery power to provide the attached equipment ( load ) energy. - Once utility power has been restored the UPS battery will automatically recharge the battery to prepare for the next power outage , a process known as the discharge cycle. - The more often discharge cycles occur , the quicker your battery will be depleted . <p> Cycling is a necessary and unavoidable part of UPS operation , however being aware of cycling frequency will help to notice abnormal / frequent cycling . Many UPS models are also adjustable , allowing the user to regulate the sensitivity to voltage sags and other transients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> UPSs that last the longest , and provide the best performance are the units that are being provided the best management and care .

The protocol is easy to adopt for a wide variety of IoT devices , platforms , and operating systems . Enterprise cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure expose their IoT PaaS through MQTT . <p> This blog post covers- the core concepts of MQTT that are necessary for building M2M and IoT applications . It covers the basic terminology , along with a section on integrating the MQTT with IoTView HMI . <p> Origin of MQTT . Why Was MQTT Created ? <p> - MQTT was created in 1999 by - Andy Stanford-Clark- and Arlen Nipper . The motivation for designing MQTT was to create a lightweight and bandwidth-efficient protocol that was data agnostic with support for multiple levels of Quality of Service. - Today , those are the same reasons for which MQTT is chosen for implementing IoT solutions . <p> How does MQTT Work ? <p> MQTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium . <p> - MQTT uses the publisher &amp; subscriber pattern to connect interested parties with each other . It does it by decoupling the sender-publisher with the receiver -subscriber . The publisher sends a message to a central topic which has multiple subscribers waiting to receive the message . The publishers and subscribers are autonomous , which means that they do not need to know the presence of each other . <p> Where can it be used ? <p> The MQTT has been used in sensors communicating to a Broker via satellite link , over occasional dial-up connections , and in a range of automation and small device scenarios . It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size , low power usage , minimized data packets , and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers <p> Terminology .

Clients often connect to the broker through libraries ( Sample libraries available for C , C++ , Go , Java , C# , PHP , Python , Node.js , and Arduino ) and software development toolkits- ( SDKs ) . <p> Broker : The Broker is primarily responsible for : <p> receiving all messages and <p> filtering them <p> deciding who is interested <p> sending the message to all subscribed clients <p> the authentication and authorization of clients <p> It also holds the session of all persisted clients including subscriptions and missed messages . <p> A Topic In MQTT is a hierarchical structured string , which is used for message filtering and routing and determines which message gets to which client .

@@26070211 @6070211/ <h> Specialty Blogs <h> Decoding Detuned Reactors : What and Why <p> In this blog , I will acquaint you with Detuned Reactors and analyse their usage and benefits . Detuned reactors , that are three-phase inductors dedicated to attenuate the amplification of harmonics in harmonic rich networks , - protect the- different components of the installation . <p> What are Detuned reactors ? <p> Detuned Reactors prevent harmonic amplification caused due to RESONANCE and avoid the risk of overloading capacitors , thereby significantly reducing voltage and current harmonic distortion in the network . All connected equipment , and even remote substations are subject to voltage fluctuations which may result in equipment malfunction or failure . To avoid this problem , it is common to insert reactors in series with capacitor banks . <p> The reactor also by its nature will safeguard capacitor and associated switch gears against switching inrush , which other may damage capacitors , circuit breakers and contactors . <p> Why use Detuned reactor ? <p> Presence of Harmonic distortion due to the - non-linear loads within the network or due to import of harmonic from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacitors as the capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the frequency , consequently capacitors will be subjected to over load. - The over load on capacitors can cause premature failure in capacitor due to increased voltage and thermal stress on dielectric . <p> On the other hand , the inductive reactance XL of a Reactor is directly proportional to frequency : The magnitude of inductive reactance will increase with high frequency harmonics thus blocking the harmonic current . Hence , use of detuned reactor in series with capacitor will offer higher impedance for harmonics , thus eliminating risk of over load in capacitors . <p> The inductance value of detuned reactor is selected such that the resonance frequency is less than 90% of dominant harmonic in the spectrum. - For example : if 5th harmonic is dominant in the spectrum , any series LC circuit having resonance frequency 90% of 250Hz ( for 50Hz system ) , i.e. if the natural resonance frequency of LC is less than 225Hz , it is categorized as detuned filters or detuned capacitors . <p> Reduces over heating of the transformer , busbars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Reduces the harmonic current in the electrical supply system <p> Addresses the harmonic problems created by non-linear loads . <p> Improves Power Factor in harmonic rich environment . <p> Technical data <p> They form a complete product range from - 6 to 100 kvar and are available in the most common tunings like 135 , 190 and 210 Hz for network voltage of 400/415V 50Hz . They must be chosen according to the capacitors they are associated with . <p> To prevent disturbances in a remote installation , select a tuning frequency that is at a lower value than the ripple control frequency ( applicable for- networks having Remote Utility metering system ) . In a detuned filter application , the voltage across the capacitors will be higher than the nominal system voltage due to Vector sum of voltage drop , hence - the capacitors must be designed to withstand higher voltages. - Typical capacitor voltages for 400/415V network are 480V , 525V etc. 69633 @qwx269633 69634 @qwx269634 69635 @qwx269635 69636 @qwx269636 
@@26070230 @6070230/ <h> Are Scrubbers a relevant solution for shipping industry ? <p> By 2012 per the Marpol6 global regulation , ships are restricted to Sulphur emission of 1% in ECA areas and 3.5% in Global areas. - By 2015 , Sulphur emission must be reduced to 0.1% in the ECA areas . Those areas outside ECA must reduce the sulphur emission by 0.5% by 2020 . In order to comply with these regulations , the Shipping Industry has started to search for options to reduce the Sulphur Emission . One of the available options is the use of scrubbers . <p> Scrubber systems are a diverse group of air pollution control devices that can be used to remove some particulates and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams . Traditionally , the term " scrubber " has referred to pollution control devices that use liquid to wash unwanted pollutants from a gas stream . These Scrubbers are directly installed on the ships . There are several methods to remove toxic or corrosive compounds from exhaust gas and neutralize it and hence there are different varieties of scrubbers . Scrubber can be classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particulates . <p> The main advantage of scrubbers is the continual use of the cheaper bunker fuel than low sulphur fuel and thereby reducing the switching cost to an entirely new fuel system . <p> With these advantages scrubbers seem to be an ideal solution , but not all vessels are suitable for scrubbers and therefore retrofitting is required . The price of retrofitting a single vessel is estimated to be around $3-5 million per ship ( Guidance to INTERTANKO Members for the Selection of Compliance Alternatives July 2012 ) . One side effect of scrubbing is that the process only moves the unwanted substance from the exhaust gases into a liquid solution , solid paste or powder form . This must be disposed of safely , if it can not be reused . Furthermore , the environmental benefits of scrubber can be discussed : <p> Scrubbers can cut only one exhaust at a time ( i.e. SOx or NOx ) . Consequently , it has to be emphasized that scrubbers will not be able to match long term MARPOL6 deadlines , requiring a drastic reduction of both SOx and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuel is more than 3.5% then the elimination of the SOx is not 100% . <p> Scrubbers can not cut the emission of CO2 and it reduces the PM only by 60% <p> In the past year , some ship-liners have invested in scrubber technology . But still there are other ship-liners which have turned towards LNG or shore connection in seeking a solution to the emissions problem . The latter solution provides deeper environmental benefits by cutting all emissions ( SOx , NOx , CO2 and PM ) , noise and vibration to zero in ports where ships emission causes the most health issues . <p> Hi Lor+ne , very interesting information about the scrubbers technology , thanks ! As additional information I think it is interesting to add that not any scrubbers system in the market can be integrated on any vessel . The compatibility of the particular system needs to be validated by the vessel motor(s) manufacturer , which means the ship owner is not free to create a customized system , but needs to adapt to the motor manufacturers list of validated scrubbers systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm / comment on this ? Thanks ! <p> Hi Lorene . In my experience the exhausts from the ships generators do n't  go through the scrubbers anyway , its only the Main Propulsion that does . Therefore when the ship is at berth the scubbers do n't  make any difference . <p> The scrubber technology sounds great for the ships for reducing the emission of sulphur . But I think only integrating scrubber system in the vessels wo n't solve all the environmental issues . More important is that shipping companies follow all the environmental regulations . Wave Marine shipping company is one company that follows all environmental rules . 69633 @qwx269633 69634 @qwx269634 69635 @qwx269635 69636 @qwx269636

@@26070243 @6070243/ <h> Understanding Data Center Reliability , Availability and the Cost of Downtime <p> here 's a sobering statistic from the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington , D.C. : 93% of businesses that have lost availability in their data center for 10 days or more have filed for bankruptcy within one year . <p> We all know downtime is to be avoided but that little tidbit really drives home just how important it is . It 's also important , then , to understand all the threats to data center availability as well as the cost of downtime " so you can make the business case to address those threats . <p> First let 's define a few terms associated with the topic . Reliability is the ability of a system or component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time . <p> Availability , on the other hand , is the degree to which a system or component is operational and accessible when it 's required for use . Reliability factors into availability , as does recovery time after a failure occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design is the most critical variable . But once a failure does occur , the most important consideration becomes getting the IT equipment and business processes up and running as fast as possible , thus keeping downtime to a minimum . <p> When measuring data center availability , you 'll no doubt hear about 5 9s , which can be quite misleading . It derives from the world of networking , where if the network is available 99.999% of the time , which translates to all but 5 minutes per year , it is considered highly reliable . But it does n't translate so neatly to a data center . Too often , it is used to refer to the amount of time the data center is powered up . But loss of power is only one part of the equation when it comes to data center availability . <p> Consider two data centers that are both considered 99.999% available . In one year , Data Center A loses power once , for 5 minutes . Data Center B loses power 10 times , but for only 30 seconds each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of 5 minutes each , you must also consider recovery time . Anytime a server loses power , for example , it has to reboot , recover data and repair corrupted data . The time it takes to recover , known as the mean time to recover ( MTR ) , could be minutes , hours or days . So the data center that loses power 10 times will have a far greater MTR than the one that lost power only once " and hence probably far from a 99.999% availability rating . <p> Other factors that pose a threat to data center availability include lack of cooling and hot spots , both of which can lead to downtime if IT equipment gets too hot . Other threats to IT equipment include prolonged improper utility power , exposure to high or low temperatures , humidity , component failures and simply old age . Disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes obviously pose threats to data center availability as well . <p> But according to Gartner Group , the largest single cause of data center downtime is human error , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to mistakes in change management , and fragmented systems management . <p> To learn more about the various threats to data center availability , and how to calculate the cost of downtime in your own data center , check out Fundamentals of Availability . It is one of the many courses offered by Schneider Electrics free online education program Energy University , a series of courses based on an intuitive , interactive platform . The course takes only about an hour and you 'll gain valuable information to help you make the business case for improvements that will boost the availability of your data center .

Basicly I work on variable.dbf file in exel through its addin ( very usefull ) . <p> Before I did n't  know how important is to edit variable.dbf carefully ( I deleted , moved , created a lots of tags , playing with it and so on ) . Of course well known fatal error " OID out of range " dissapeard . <p> The problem is : After reseting OIDs I can compile . But when I add new variable through citect popup ( " Variable tags not found . Do you wish to add the uknown tags ? " ) <p> I got OIDs fatal error again . Every time ! <p> I realised , that new var is on first place in variable.dbf ( why ? ) I had to create new project to make this over me . But I am so curious what is solution for the problem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file ? <p> And anyway - in abclx driver help there is written that connections are based on OIDs and its very important to edit . dbf files carefully . What does it mean " carefully " ? What Can I do and what should I avoid ? Any practice advices ? Can I delete tags in . dbf file or not ? I would like to avoid fatals like this on site . <p> Citect OID out of order error ( know how to reset , but I have other issue ) <p> By " Carefully " means not to change the format of the file any way ie field widths etc , <p> Citect has an addin for Excel that allows you to edit the dbf files without changeing their format and it works really well . Another method is to use the Tag import / export facility which I prefer as it allows you to manage large mumbers of Tags more easily . <p> Basicly I work on variable.dbf file in exel through its addon ( very usefull ) . <p> Guys , I am allready using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OID fatal error " and how to fix it definetly when it appear again . ( Like I have written , I can reset OIDs and I can compile , but then when I add new variable by pop up , I got it again ) <p> Citect OID out of order error ( know how to reset , but I have other issue ) <p> You can not change the column or row widths this will cause these issues . You are also limited in the length of characters in the fields or it will fail . My guess you made changes to the row and columns and this is the cause of the OID faults . <p> Every time you edit the variable.dbf file and add or change the order of the tags , open the Computer Setup Editor and change the value of the Reset parameter to 1 . That will reset the OID cvlues and eliminate the error .

Zgraggen <p> Archived Message <p> September 29th , 2000 , 06:04 AM <p> Moderators note : Lots of responses are included in this message . Thanks to all who responded . ------------------- <p> &gt; I found a parameter CODE Threads=xy . But before I change that value &gt; xy , I 'd like to know how many Threads I really need . Is there a &gt; possibilitiy to observe the number of actual threads ( i.e. kernel &gt; table ) ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what you need to know . Also , if you enable the debugger in Cicode Editor , the View Threads window will also help . The former is better in that it updates itself properly , the latter is useful because you can double-click a thread and jump to the Cicode it is running to see what is actually going on . <p> The default number of threads is 64 , and you could easily just decide that you need more than that . From experience , I suspect that it is more likely , however , that threads are starting but not correctly terminating , so whatever you set it to the limit will be reached - it just might take longer . So you are right to investigate this first . <p> You may also notice that since the Out of Cicode Threads message box itself requires a thread to display , the last thread to be successfully created is terminated to allow the message to be shown . When you okay the message , that leaves one thread spare . Do n't  be fooled by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that you 're getting an extra thread given to you every time you run out .... <p> Hey Marco , There is an article in the citect knowledge base(#1739) that might she 'd some light on your problem . Also the command in the kernel is PAGE TABLE CICODE , which will display all running threads . Hope this helps . <p> This table contains the a list of all Cicode tasks currently running . It contains the task name , handle and running state , as well as some statistics . CPUTime is the total time that the task has run for - it is incremented each time the task runs . The CPU is the percentage of total available CPU that the task is using ( fast tasks often have 00 CPU ) . <p> Before you start increasing the number of threads , I would suggest you make sure that there are n't  any rogue threads running and not stopping or something . This table will help identify the culprit ( if any ) <p> Regards , <p> Stuart <p> -----Message Separator----- <p> M. Zgraggen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citect.ini flag I would look for a bug in your cicode . It sounds like you are not terminating some of the threads when the code is done with them and you are creating them on the fly . This will cause Citect to run out of threads . We use numerous threads in our application and have not needed to change the flag . <p> To see what threads are running go into the Citect kernel and type in : <p> page table cicode <p> This will show a list of the names of threads excuting . It is useful as it shows if there is any cicode which is n't coded properly which results in never ending threads not exiting correctly . <p> I have also seen the a similar problem while running V5.21 . Removing the Windows screen saver seemed to have removed the out of cicode threads from reappearing .

The problem is that I have many calls to a fonction that are triggered by event ...

This has happened here and you need to prevent it .
