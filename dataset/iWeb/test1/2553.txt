@@12024565 @624565/ <h> Communication in Today 's World of Tools <p> By the Yammer team , on March 12 , 2015May 25 , 2016 0Shares <p> This post was co-authored by Microsofts Ragnar Heil <p> Tools , tools , tools or better said : apps , apps , apps in todays modern workplace we have numerous possibilities to collaborate and share our knowledge , thoughts and questions . We can be creative , we can share , we can like , we can play and we can have fun at work . <p> But where there 's an up , there is also a downside . During my day-to-day work helping customers find the right strategy to move to the cloud or better said , moving to Office 365 , we see a lot of questions around which tool to use and when . That 's what this blog post is about : writing down some best practices and some guidance about what works for tools like Office 365- Groups , Yammer , Distribution Lists , SharePoint , e-mail , Public Folders , Site Mailboxes , Shared Mailboxes or Skype for Business ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products can be confusing sometimes , but during day-to-day business , you 'll see that the right one can be easy to pick . A strict separation is not necessary and you can interact easily across the tools and get the most out of them . Its all about communication and todays blog post tries to help you find a guidance to improve your day-to-day experience . <p> Skype for Business- and e-mail : both tools are intended for one-to-one communication . Skype for Business is more in an instant style you use it when you just want to ask a quick question or need a fast advice or tip . Within Skype for Business you see your current status : are you currently available ( green ) , off-work or away ( yellow ) , busy ( red ) or not to be disturbed ( one-way ) . A nice aspect of Skype for Business is that it interacts with your Outlook calendar and sets your status automatically while you are in a customer meeting to " in a meeting " or " do not disturb " during a presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a larger group : electronic conferences are a great way to avoid time-consuming meetings and expensive travel costs . Those functions help us make our world smaller and more connected , even if we are ( sometimes thousands of ) miles away . My customers use that for electronic meetings because many of them are working from offices all around the globe . The hardest part there is always to find a time that is comfortable for everyone my experience is that Europeans get used to work later in the afternoon , Americans get up early and Asians and Australians are somewhere in between . <p> E-Mail nowadays is both a blessing and a curse . We do everything in Outlook . We send and receive e-mail , read newsletters , manage our calendars , organize our contacts and much more . But e-mail is not an instant tool its more efficient to use Skype for Business to ask a quick question or call by phone for a short clarification before writing 10 or more e-mails for just one thing . E-mail is excellent for communicating with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future reference . It is exactly what its name says : electronic mail which means it is used for communication where you do not need to have an immediate answer , where you communicate with others on a 1:1 basis , where you want to share information . In Microsofts world , Outlook is THE tool to manage e-mail , but in todays device changing world we also use Outlook Web Access or even mobile apps for writing , reading and receiving e-mail . Exchange Online helps us to stay productive with e-mails : Clutter splits e-mail into those that are really relevant for you and those you might not even need to answer . E-mail attachments can be stored in OneDrive for Business or any other Cloud storage solution of your choice and you send only hyperlinks to those documents instead of the attachment itself . Those modern ( sharing ) functionalities should help us avoid the nightmare of ending up with 10 different versions of one document . <p> OneDrive for Business let 's us store information either on a personal basis or for sharing with others . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ( or all ) documents with team members or external collaborators . All files stored there can be automatically synchronized so you are always up-to-date , even when you 're offline . I use OfB for all my business-related files . That makes it very easy for me to switch between devices because the only thing I need to do is sign in on the next device and receive a history of my recent files and work with them . For users , its easy to share files with colleagues or other collaborators . The administrator can decide which level of sharing is best for their users , so there is a good flexibility in these options . A selective sync option is strongly missed today , but with the rapid innovation we see out of Office 365 I think this is just a matter of time . My customers love OfB for the huge storage options it provides : unlimited space . That means many customers look at using OfB in the future as the personal file storage ( sometimes called " Home Drive " ) for their users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups working together on projects , files and other information that needs to be more structured or even delivered in processes or workflows . The same sharing functionality from OfB is present also in SharePoint Online . In my current projects , many customers decide to replace their public FTP file server which is typically installed somewhere in a DMZ and a burden to IT admins with a SharePoint site collection that allows anonymous sharing . That is beneficiary for both sides : the user gets a more user-friendly interface and an easy-to-use sharing platform . No need for any complicated FTP client to be installed and no more manuals about how to use it . The IT Admin has one fewer server with a potential security risk and an update strategy . Less servers in DMZ , less risk . Sharing stays under control . Documents can be discussed and liked in Yammer , which makes it easy to edit a file during the review process . <p> Yammer is best in unstructured collaboration and communication . Employees engage and there are no hierarchical limits and boundaries everybodys voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups about ideas , share knowledge , learn from collaboration and recognize individuals as experts . Yammer can also be used for external communication . Within an " external network " you can collaborate with people outside your own organization . A very good example from the field is using Yammer as a customer community . Engage with your customers , ask questions and give answers . People learn about your skills and get engaged in the network if they find answers . That is also a central point of any ( enterprise ) social network : the content needs to be relevant for a participant . If there is no content , the network is not relevant and engagement declines . The most successful networks where I am involved are those where community management and moderation is alive and helpful . Also networks with engagement from executives are very successful . Speaking openly and with less hierarchy helps networks grow and to stay focused . People from HR love Yammer networks since they can now engage with new hires and provide them with relevant information to help them onboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are normally on the road ( like flight attendants or stewards ) prefer the easy and fast way of communication you have through mobile apps in Yammer . From a security perspective , those Enterprise Yammer networks are preferred as a tool where IT has control instead of having users share company information on public social sites . <p> Yammer can also be used to reduce the amount of internal distribution lists and so reduce e-mail traffic . More information about that can be read at my blog here . <p> And last but not least : Office 365 Groups . Office 365- Groups are currently in the beginning stages , but it looks like they will be a powerful tool to help us to bring the other tools together . Groups combine Exchange functionality with e-mail , calendar and contacts with SharePoint Online functionality and file sharing . And Groups will interact with Yammer as well. - So an Office 365 Group interacts across the boundaries of todays tools because its not the tool , which is important its us and our way to work .

@@12024570 @624570/ <h> Yammer <p> For those of you unfamiliar with the product , Yammer bills itself as an enterprise internal social network . It mixes the typical chat messenger application with collaboration tools available in Office 365 . <p> Similar to the Delve tool we looked at last week , Yammer can serve as the central hub for team collaboration . From within a Yammer discussion , teams can set up meeting appointments using Outlook , switch to a full-fledged Skype for Business video meeting , and access OneDrive for Business to create collaborative documents . <p> The initial rollout of Yammer took place on February 2 , 2016 ; the rest of the rollout will take place in stages . The next release is March 1 , 2016 , and the last is April 1 , 2016 .

@@12024578 @624578/ <h> Overcoming the Fear of Sharing <p> By the Yammer team , on January 14 , 2014June 28 , 2017 0Shares <p> It has been- 4- months since I joined the- Microsoft- Yammer team . Prior to that , - I was a customer of Yammer and was responsible for bringing Yammer into our company , getting business buy-in and executive support , launching our network , training the company , and managing our community . During that process I got to know the tool like the back of- my hand. - I encouraged our users to- work- out- loud- and to not be afraid to share- what they are working on- and ask questions. - I encouraged them to err on the side of sharing too much when it came to their work . More was more ! <p> So why am I telling you all of this ? <p> I have a confession to make . I , Ashley Gross , have a fear of sharing . Joining a new company , despite knowing the tool and the culture , comes with uncertainty of where and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . This was a fear I never knew I had until I had to practice what I preached for so long , and in all honesty , it- has been paralyzing at times . <p> When joining Yammer , I found myself sending Lync messages or private messages on Yammer to my fellow team members instead of posting in our corresponding- Microsoft network- groups . Every once in a while someone would encourage me to post the question- in our network- so- everyone- could see . This was a- cause for pause with me . For years , I was the one encouraging open sharing and now the tables have- turned ! - " How do I get past this ? " I asked- myself . <p> Along the way , I have learned some lessons on how overcome my fear and to begin to truly collaborate- out loud . Below are my three steps to help overcome these fears ( which- may sound familiar ) : <p> STOP- If you 're like me , you have a tendency to over think things when fear is involved . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if- I offend someone ? " " If I ask for help , I look like I do n't  know what I 'm doing . " - Stop the voices in your head . They are just your fears trying to stop you from achieving what you 're trying to accomplish- and- stalling you in your growth . <p> DROP- Drop those voices in your head like a bad habit . They serve no purpose for the greater good of you , your team , or your company . Instead of focusing on the negative voices , ask yourself " Why not ? " Remember that sharing with the appropriate group will help get the project done faster , the question answered from different perspectives- you may have never considered , - give you a voice you may not have otherwise had . <p> ROLL- Let the sharing and collaborating roll . Roll with the feedback and know that each response helps make you and your team that much better . Check out other peoples posts , respond to them when and where you can add value , and just roll with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out to be . <p> As an act of conquering my fear , I even shared the rough draft version of this blog post in the most active group on our Microsoft Yammer network .

@@12024581 @624581/ <p> As part of last weeks press conference , we were pleased to announce the results of " The Total Economic Impact ( TEI ) of Yammer ( April 2011 ) " , a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Yammer . For this study , Forrester Consulting used its proven TEI framework , which helps organizations make smart investment decisions about emerging software like Yammer . <p> Background : a multi-step approach <p> Forrester Consulting conducted this study over an intensive 12-week period . After interviewing Yammer product management , marketing , sales , and customer success , Forrester Consulting gathered industry data relative to Yammer and the enterprise collaboration market in general . Forrester Consulting then interviewed four organizations with paid , mature , and active networks , in order to assess costs , benefits , risks , and flexibility . Based on the actual experiences of these organizations , Forrester Consulting designed a composite organization and representative financial model , factoring in the applied cost and benefit data . <p> ROI and benefits <p> The results : for a 21,000 employee organization with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at list pricing , the study concluded that Yammer yielded a risk-adjusted return on investment ( ROI ) of 365 percent with a payback period of 4.3 months and $5.7 million in net present value . <p> According to Forrester , the next big opportunities for enterprise are : innovation , collective decision-making and better access to information and expertise across organizational and geographic boundaries . <p> Above is an overview presentation of the Forrester TEI of Yammer study , which highlighted these key benefits : <p> Visible collaboration and communication leading to project cost savings from deduplication of work and reorganization of processes <p> Improved employee productivity for engaged Yammer users due to information-sharing and better access to expertise <p> Improving vertical communication between company leadership and employees <p> Providing a public venue for and record of conversations <p> Faster onboarding with an average of a ten percent reduction in new hire training costs <p> Specific efficiency improvements noted in the study include : <p> An organization that discovered an 18-step process involving seven different systems could be streamlined to eight steps , saving 20 minutes per week for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 12-person team shared a pilot program on Yammer , enabling seven other teams to repurpose the program without duplicating work and saved 5,040 man-hours in the process <p> Learn more in our upcoming webinar <p> In light of these findings , we 've invited Rob Koplowitz , Vice President and Principal Analyst and Michelle Bishop , Senior Consultant , to next weeks webinar entitled " The Business Value of Enterprise Social Networking " . - During the webinar , Rob will discuss the impact of enterprise social , while Michelle will present the study itself . Click here to register for our June 2nd webinar . <p> Great results , but ROI is n't everything <p> While were proud of these findings and extend our thanks to Forrester Consulting , we also know this is n't the entire story of what value Yammer brings to an organization . Yammer supports immediate coordination and ongoing communications , providing real-time access to information while preserving institutional knowledge . The value of Yammer is more than just numbers it is grounded in usage : how a network is used to do what , by whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given who uses Yammer to do what , Yammers value is multifaceted and usage varies extensively . Globally , there are over 100,000 companies in 165 countries with Yammer networks , from local merchants to F100s , North American startups to European multi-nationals , regional utility companies to international non-profits . They use Yammer to connect distributed workers , facilitate discussions , and find the right people and answers to solve problems . Organizationally , our user base spans CEOs and CIOs to seasoned executives and new hires joining the ranks fresh from college . They use Yammer to announce and syndicate strategic decisions , bring together and motivate teams , and better understand their roles in the company at large . <p> From working with this array of customers with diverse organizational and user needs , were learning that the value of Yammer is not just about calculating hard return . Each company and each user has a unique network experience , comprised of measurable and immeasurable benefits . Network engagement and growth statistics , Group and Community formation , tangible performance benefits quantified through metrics , these represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are difficult , if not impossible , to measure , yet they complete the story . These include the outcomes from cross-training , informal mentorship , behavioral modeling , and culture building . Some of the most compelling network stories our customers report are about employees helping each other , sharing achievements , and finding greater enjoyment in what they do because they feel more connected and have a better idea of why their contributions matter . <p> Were learning that beyond the known benefits , the value of Yammer can come from the unknown . This TEI study revelas that Yammer can surface inefficiencies and roadblocks that hamper employees and companies as well as hidden pockets of talent and expertise . Yammer exposes new opportunities for growth and profitability , by giving unprecedented visibility into the systems and front lines of businesses and by prompting innovation and new ideas . In order to act , an organization must first see and understand , through a platform that offers open , transparent communications . <p> Were also learning the value of Yammer is predicated on the quality and relevance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a network to what a company seeks to achieve and to what each employee wants to accomplish . Yammers value story can be infinite in that regard , from saving an individual employees time to streamlining a process that impacts an entire company to providing the best possible feature set and network experience that optimizes usability for people everywhere . <p> While important , measurement only one way to show the value of Yammer . ROI is a great start but only the beginning .

@@12024586 @624586/ <h> Designing And Developing Communities of Practice As A Competitive Advantage <p> By the Yammer team , on April 17 , 2013May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> A few weeks ago , I gave a talk at the Microsoft Community Summit about communities of practice their business value , how they are different from other internal and external communities , and strategies for success in starting them up and growing them in a sustainable way . I invite you to view the presentation embedded below ; here are some main points . <h> What is a community of practice and why you should care <p> Communities of practice - ( CoP ) are different than many other internal communities in that their purpose is n't to get a project done or to collaborate on a team or across teams for a business outcome . Rather , their goal is to steward , develop and up-level domain-based knowledge at a group of professionals inside and across organizations . This is not to say that knowledge built through work in a community of practice ca n't benefit the work you do in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should help its members perform their jobs better . <p> Knowledge is one of these really tricky areas its critically important , yet highly evasive . The amount of information produced by the world makes knowledge obsolete almost immediately . At the same time , we need knowledge more than ever before in this interdependent , global world , knowing something that happened in China could directly impact something you are doing in Mexico . Ability to get information , turn it into insights and knowledge , and mobilize people to do something with it this is the competitive advantage of today . <p> In helping me prepare for this talk , I heavily leaned on " Cultivating Communities of Practice " by Wenger , McDermott and Snyder a recommendation from our awesome community member Simon Terry. - They define a community of practice as having 3 key elements : <p> Domain what your shared purpose is , knowledge you are building , <p> Practice the domain-based method of creating knowledge , such as frameworks , standards and knowledge bases , <p> Community the social fabric of learning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , community design is critical to success of any community . From the research that Ive done , people Ive talked to , and based on personal experience , I see there being four main design " buckets " for CoPs . <h> 1 ) Design for value <p> You should design your community in such a way that the value gained is apparent to each member from the first minute they get there . Well-designed communities know exactly who is participating in them , what they bring to the table , what roles they play , and how to help people get what they need . A healthy community connects people with experience to those looking for that experience , and to other complementary experiences . You should be ready to name the WIIFM ( what 's in it for me ) for each participant or participant " persona " , and you should design ways for various levels of contribution to happen : from reading , to engaging , to creating content . <h> 2 ) Design to catalyze <p> Your community needs to evolve ; otherwise it reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to design the right systems for people to get and contribute value right away , you do n't  want to over-engineer the community . Do n't  forget the value of building the community with the community its strength often gets forged through the creative act of defining , building and growing . <p> Create the right mix of private and public spaces just enough to get things going , but leave it open enough so that others can build it out . Even the healthiest of communities wont stay that way indefinitely without a " shot of adrenaline in the arm " every once in a while . Engagement events become important as they get people participating in different ways and mediums . You may get together in person , weekly call , monthly webinar , speaker series , retreats its up to you ! Mix it up , but keep a constant rhythm going . <h> 3 ) Design for smart growth <p> All communities need to grow ; in fact , if you are n't  growing , you are dying . How you grow matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new people into a community without the right onboarding experience and without ambassador member involvement . <p> You always want to have a healthy balance of new and expert members . To that end , you will want to understand how you recruit and approve new members . What is the vetting process , and expectations of members ? You will want to think about the quality of the member you 'd want in the community and design a vetting process that makes sense . If you raise the bar for membership higher , your community will be smaller and more engaged because people have more skin in the game . More open communities have a low ( if any ) bar for entry , and may have less engaged members , as the sense of community is n't as strong . <p> As you grow , do n't  forget to measure against your success KPIs that is how you will continue to get funding and mindshare. <h> 4 ) . Design to self-sustain <p> Finally , you want to design your community so that it does n't  need any one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation and not worry about what 's happening in your community . If you design your community for value and smart growth , enable members to develop as community leaders , you will have a great group of ambassadors . Create an environment where people want to and are able to connect , facilitate storytelling , and give up control to your ambassadors . <p> Now back to you ! Have you developed or been a part of a community of practice at work ( inside or outside of your company ) ? What made it successful ? What are some things you learned ? -

@@12024588 @624588/ <h> Benefits Of Enterprise Social Networks Align With CEO Priorities <p> By the Yammer team , on November 21 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> As enterprise social networking starts to gain wider acceptance across businesses of all sizes , the C-suite is realizing tremendous benefits from increased collaboration and better communication . To know how enterprise social networking benefits CEOs , its important to understand CEO priorities. - A few months ago , the Conference Board released- this study about CEO priorities across industries . - The following were determined to be the key priorities across all industries : business growth , talent , cost optimization and innovation . Let 's take a closer look at how enterprise social networks like Yammer can help CEOs reach these challenging goals . <p> Business Growth <p> Ultimately , growth is every companys number one objective . If you are n't  growing , innovative competitors start to give you a run for your money , and eventually squeeze you out . You need to be growing by expanding your user base , as well as penetrating further in your existing user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helping businesses accelerate their rate of growth in a variety of ways . When employees are exchanging information freely , without information silos slowing them down , the Company is able to properly service current business and aggressively pursue new business . Just check out this example of hastening problem resolution time , given by Giam Swiegers , the CEO of Deloitte Australia ( roughly at the 1:22 marker ) . <p> Talent retention and productivity <p> Of course , no business growth can occur without attracting and retaining the right talent . " The emergence of talent as a key challenge shows the economy may be beginning to take a turn to a more healthy state , " said Rebecca Ray , managing director of human capital for the Conference Board . A business that 's internally social tends to go hand in hand with a strong culture of achievement , innovation , openness and risk-taking . This kind of culture is more likely to attract and retain high-performing talent . <p> A key emerging trend in the new Connected Enterprise is treating employees as an asset and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT and HR perspective . Organizations that recognize that by empowering employees to achieve instead of impeding them , - will gain a competitive advantage in retaining key talent . Because the current " social media generation " is used to working with tools that are increasingly social and collaborative , the ability to foster that type of work environment while still satisfying privacy and security concerns is key to engagement in the workplace . A recent Gallup poll indicates that most employees still do n't  feel engaged at work . There is a real opportunity to convert engagement to productivity with networks like Yammer . <p> Talent acquisition and retention are just some of the ways in which an enterprise social network can help your business stay competitive . - More effective onboarding via Yammer not only allows for faster information-finding and access to more current information being part of a companys social network from Day 1 ensures a tighter cultural fit that furthers the relationship between the employee and employer . Furthermore , as innovation is moving at a faster clip , its becoming more important for employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer into your training programs , you are helping your employees maintain their skills and thus peak job performance . <p> Cost optimization <p> In uncertain and unstable economic times especially , the ability to remain lean is oftentimes a determinant of survival . However , information workers are wasting more and more time because their business systems do n't  deliver the right information at the right time . According to the IDC " Hidden Costs of Information Work in the Enterprise " study , most workers spend 8.8 hours each week searching and gathering information , of which 3.7 hours are spent searching for information and not finding it , and 2.5 hours are spent recreating content that already exists . These lost 6.2 hours cost $10,001 per worker per year , adding up to $10 million for every 1,000 employees . The cost is staggering for any business looking to remain lean and agile , especially in tough economic times . Additionally , its important to consider the opportunity cost of that time , which should be spent solving real business problems and innovating . The speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By making content social , Yammer is able to reduce the costs of information finding . <p> Innovation <p> Finally , innovation can be also given a proverbial shot of adrenaline by using enterprise social networks . When employees discover what colleagues on their teams and across all functional areas are working on , they are able to make better decisions and innovate not only in terms of the product , but also business process . Cross-functional discussion and collaboration simply allows for better ideas to be born . Greater transparency into internal innovation coupled with market-facing insights always yield better products and market leadership over competitors . When teams can come together and informal projects and work sessions without going through layers of decision-making , the company saves time and money . <p> Yammer is benefitting CEOs today ; helping them transform their organizations and meet critical business objectives .

Verified Admin Only*nnYammer Data Export will package and export **all **messages ( including previous versions ) , Notes , Files , topics , users , and groups . Data will be exported into a zip file containing . csv files for messages ( including previous versions ) and additional archives containing Files and Pages . You can perform a one-time export simply by specifying the starting date from which you would like to export and the end date to which you would like to export . You can access these settings under Admin &gt; Content and Security &gt; Export Data . Alternatively , you can set up automatic recurring exports by utilizing the Yammer API . The data export is a . zip file that includes : nn * Messages , MessageVersions , Users , Topics , and Groups in separate . CSV files : this contains complete details of each data type , such as message I 'd , timestamps , participants , group names , etc. n n * Files and Notes folders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Data Export packages and exports all messages ( including previous versions ) , Pages , files , topics , users and groups in your network . You can easily set up and create recurring exports using the Yammer Data Export API or download a one-time export from the Admin Tools Interface. nn**Highlights**nn * Comprehensive Data Export : Export all the data on your network , including messages ( including previous versions ) , pages , files , topics , users and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of pages and files ( all content created or modified during the time period specified ) . Note : We recommend downloading data with files by using a one-day range , to reduce the likelihood of errors caused by an unreliable data connection . If there are a lot of files on the specified day , we recommend exporting by using a one-hour range. nn * Data Export API : Utilize the Data Export API to set up and customize automatic , recurring exports for your network . The API provides more control , flexibility and customization for IT admins. n n * Simplified One-Time Exports : Simply specify a starting date to have all of your network data from that starting point exported. n n * Data Retention : Choose between Hard Delete and Soft Delete options to meet your needs . Hard Delete permanently removes data when it is deleted on the network and is recommended for most networks . Soft Delete keeps deleted data visible in data exports. nn * For the network on which the external group " lives " , we export all content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a group member , VAs only receive threads that the external user explicitly participated in ( posted a message to ) . If there is a message in the group that the user did not participate in , it will not be available in the data export. nnn**Using the Yammer API to Set-up Recurring Exports**nnWith the introduction of the Data Export API , Yammer will be phasing out the older recurring export functionality and simplifying the data export admin interface . The older recurring export functionality will remain temporarily available , but we encourage admins to transition to the Data Export API . The Data Export API provides more flexibility and control for admins , and allows admins to create automatic recurring exports to meet their needs. nn**Sample Data Export Script**nnA sample script using the API is provided below in order to ease this transition .

@@12024607 @624607/ <h> The Rise of The Empowered Employee <p> By the Yammer team , on March 16 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Every major business era shifts sources of competitive advantage and displaces sources of power . The confluence of advances in social , mobile and cloud technologies has begun to shift economic power from large-scale institutions that dominated the industrial age through sheer size and economies of scale to self-organizing individuals and loosely governed networks . The ability to self-organize in order to produce and repurpose products and information has reduced the efficacy of long-standing business frameworks , processes and decision-making . Nilofer Merchant points out that Porters Model no longer works , and while we do n't  need to throw out the proverbial baby with the bathwater , we need to drastically shift our thinking . <p> In the industrial age , companies had the power , and employees and consumers alike were cogs in the giant machine . Dachis Groups Dave Gray does a great job of juxtaposing the paradigms of " Company as a Machine " vs. the " Company as an Organism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As part of the " machine , " employees were hired for specific skills and for narrowly defined jobs , measured against the same objectives as their peers , and were easily replaced . As a recovering MBA , I can personally attest to this job " conveyor belt . " Businesses operated with the assumption that consumer demand could be predicted based on levels of advertising spend , but the social web definitely put a kibosh in that . Much has been written about the rise of the empowered consumer , but the notion of the empowered employee has been largely an afterthought until recently . While every company claims to be employee-centric , employees are often treated as costs and not assets , as noted by John Hagel of Deloitte . <p> Brands have sprung to external social channels for the fear of being left behind and losing control of brand conversations a move that 's more defensive than it is proactive . By being defensive , we end up missing huge opportunities to really create something meaningful together and you cant create something meaningful without your employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach further in their jobs , how can you expect to give your customers the experience they need ? While working with the empowered consumer is the low-hanging fruit , are we really harnessing the power and passion of the empowered employee ? <p> In his book , " The Power of Pull " which has been hugely influential to me personally , and focuses on the values that Yammer helps companies embrace John Hagel talks about necessity of shifting from predictable outputs and inputs to activating the right resources and ecosystems at the right time . And guess who the biggest parts of this ecosystem are ? People ! <p> Who is this empowered employee and how did he / she become so empowered ? <p> Employees have long been using social tools and communicating with peers , friends and family . The lines between consumer and employee are blurring and becoming more arbitrary . Social tools are erasing the rigidity between B2C and B2B , to the point where all socially aware businesses are embracing the Peer-to-Peer approach ; first and foremost , people want to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks they can tap in order to get work done , thus weakening their dependencies on company resources . By joining creation spaces and communities , individuals can now create products , content and even movements , based on their passions and find solutions that they would n't find on their own . Instead of talking about the work they do in interviews , the empowered employee has a digital record , which acts as an online resume , making him / her discoverable and attractive to employers . The empowered employee does n't  need approval to use the technology and devices he or she wants to use to get work done , and locking down access to sites at work is futile , as employees bring their devices to work . <p> To understand power shifts , you have to also look at sources of trust . Edelman Digital publishes its Trust Barometer every year , and the 2012 report has marked the largest shift yet a huge increase in trust of " employees like me " : <p> Companies are slowly realizing that without the right employees and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to compete externally and deliver goods and services at the speed of todays business . There 's no need to jump to complete anarchy where employees take over the company and abolish all process . However , the massive opportunity lies in a deliberate , collaborative and respectful partnership between the Company , the Employee and the Customer . To really capture this opportunity , we need to abandon our fear and figure out how we can work with our employees to harness their passions and their sense of power . <p> What 's in it for the employer ? <p> First and foremost , access to star resources . Creating environments where employees can chart their career and growth by working on what they are passionate about is simply good for business . As speed of change is overwhelming all of us , employers are struggling to assemble the right resources at the right time to solve business problems that keep changing rapidly , and to service customers who expect more . Employers ability to get , retain and tap into the brilliance of their workforce is a definite competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial age rigidity of silos , employees need to operate in ways that are flexible and allow them to bring together and disband teams for particular projects . Employees tend to be more passionate about spaces that allow them to be themselves , and passion is one of the most underrated resources in business . Its passion that helps people push for a goal bigger than themselves , be truly creative enough to solve difficult problems and simply do more and better . <p> Employee empowerment is also a key ingredient to becoming customer-centric . Our customers can now reach us in a few seconds via a simple tweet . The volume of conversations is only going to increase , and to deal with it all , employees must be empowered to solve problems . If you have to clear every action with the " powers that be " , you will fail to move at the right speed . To conduct business effectively and work with the empowered consumer , we need to become adept at exception handling , says Sameer Patel , and if you are n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply good business . On the social web , any employee can become an accidental spokesperson in front of customers , press and bloggers . Are you treating this as a liability or an opportunity to rally behind a unifying message ? Do your employees even know what you stand for ? <p> The key about employee empowerment is that its not something that we can decide to give to people , but we need to proactively listen and create environments for these kinds of behavior to sprout up . As Sara Roberts said in her Enterprise 2.0 keynote , we do n't  get to bestow empowerment upon people . There are specific things we can do to create these environments for our employees , but that 's a topic for a whole new blogpost.

@@12024611 @624611/ <h> Measuring Business Value <p> By the Yammer team , on February 12 , 2013May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> At - YamJam12 , our conference in San Francisco last October , there was much discussion around the best way to measure business value of an Enterprise Social Network . While there are many variables to consider , the best approach can be tricky to determine . Each company should look to a combination of financial and non-financial measures that link back to the companys mission , vision , strategy and business priorities . <p> In order to begin digging into the value of your network , you must first examine the content and context of conversations and activity happening . For example , a high volume of conversation on a network is great on the surface ; however , without knowing the context behind these conversations , it is difficult to quantify their value . Even knowing the context of conversations , you must still understand the business outcomes these conversations bring to the organization . Business value comes from capturing and understanding these outcomes . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin measuring small wins early on in your network . To get a good reading , it is important to have a large enough group of active and engaged users . While you do not need everyone from the organisation to participate , you do need enough people on the network to contribute enough content and form enough connections , before you can begin to realise value . For some organisations , starting with a smaller group that has a clearly defined business goal/purpose can also be an effective approach . <p> Building a network that can deliver measurable business value is a process of continuous iteration that begins with a defined business purpose or use case : " are we trying to increase collaboration , employee engagement , etc ? " Beginning with a specific focus and goal allows for opportunities to celebrate success to inspire others . As the network matures , where you focus your effort will change . <p> Now you have people communicating on the network ; what 's next ? Let 's take a look at quantitative and qualitative measurements . <p> Measuring Business Value Quantitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on network activity that can aid in measuring the value of your network . Quantitative statistics such as - the number of network members , number of posts , number of likes and number of groups are great for illustrating the growth of your network and network activity . - For instance , an upward trend in the number of posts indicates that employees are finding benefits from engaging on the network , and are continuing to come back to the network . <p> Quantitative statistics are quick and easy to obtain from Yammer , and provide a great high-level overview of the network health and growth . However , if you only chose to look to statistics , you may be missing out on some important data . Without understanding Qualitative outcomes , numbers alone do not provide a comprehensive view of business value of your Yammer network . For example , would you rather have 1,000 people on your network talking about what they had for breakfast , or 25 people on your network improving sales revenue by sharing strategies for closing big deals ? Just looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however as we analyze the content of the conversations , we see 25 people delivering more value back to the organization . Lewis Jacoby from Suncorp explained that through the use of Yammer , his team reduced internal team email by over 50% , and at the same time the team improved their communicating and were more engaged with what other members of the team were doing . <p> Measuring Business Value Qualitative <p> Capturing Qualitative outcomes from conversations and quantifying their value to the business should be the focus of analysis in mature networks . This is significantly more complex than running a simple report ; it takes effort to identify , capture and articulate how a conversation moves the business forward . <p> Identifying and articulating successes should be done at regular intervals , in order to show momentum and inspire your colleagues to begin using Yammer in their respective areas . Kai Riemer from The University of Sydney shared with our customer community : " rather than measuring ( which suggests quantitative data collection ) , storytelling in my view is a much more powerful way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one success case can outweigh the cost for an ESN for a year . " <p> So what techniques to measuring business value can you apply in your Yammer networks ? <p> Techniques to Identify Business Value <p> It will be easier to quantify business value if there is a clear vision of how Yammer is going to support the organizations mission , values and strategy . We always advise customers to form a vision for your Yammer network as a first step before launching the network . <p> Network maturity is key to understating which measure or combination of measures is most appropriate . In nascent networks , where the goal is getting people on the network and talking , quantitative measures may be more appropriate . However , as the network matures , and capturing business value becomes more important , qualitative measures will be more appropriate . <p> Ultimately a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures will probably be most appropriate , but it is important to understand the differences between these measures and the information about your network that they reveal . <p> Quantitative measurements <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of the organization and focus on the metrics that are already being used to measure performance : sales revenue , customer satisfaction , market share , travel expenses , employee retention , etc . <p> A great way to measure the impact of Yammer from the get-go , is to perform a before and after survey . Potentially this can also be linked to annual employee engagement surveys , and may reveal interesting insights into employee engagement and their engagement on Yammer . <p> Another frequently used technique to create a topic in Yammer e.g. " YamWin " to tag conversations where the outcomes from the conversation have delivered business value , making them easier to find and tabulate . Nicky Hayward-Wright from GS1 Australia shared with the customer community : " We encourage members to add the topic #yamwin to any content that they think is useful . I then collate these wins into a note ( page ) every few weeks . Rather than stating specifically the conversation or page etc , I write the win as a short paragraph in story format . The focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as highlighting positive cultural change so there is also a mix . " <p> To sum up , figure out what success looks like and how you will measure against this success . Use performance measures that that your business already understands , and look at how Yammer impacts these , rather than creating new metrics specifically for your network .

@@12024615 @624615/ <h> Trust In The Workplace : What Does It Mean To You ? <p> By the Yammer team , on August 8 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Trust <p> Trust is both a cause and an effect of company culture . The trust we have in each other informs how we operate , and the way we operate encourages trust . A chat with Yammer CTO and co-founder- Adam Pisoni a few months ago got me thinking about trust in the context of organizational dynamics . - Adam said something that stuck with me : bureaucracy exists where trust does n't  ; excessive process and overhead exist because people do n't  trust each other to do what 's right and what 's needed . - John Hagel , - co-chairman of Center for the Edge , echoes that trust is necessary for transfer of tacit knowledge , in an age where the flow of information is the competitive advantage . Fortunately , social tools make us more human , transparent and accessible , helping build trust . <p> Whether consciously or unconsciously , we make personal and business decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we trust ? How can we create the conditions where trust can flourish ? In search of the answer , I asked a few Yammer colleagues and customers what trust meant to them . Heres what they said : <h> What does trust in the workplace mean to you ? <p> Matt Ontell , Customer Success Manager , Yammer : It allows me to focus on my job , without second-guessing what others are doing . Trust helps avoid or eliminate bureaucracy , unnecessary process , and excessive oversight that can both inhibit innovation and slow progress . It is by building trust that organizations can create high performing teams . <p> Marco Rogers , Senior Software Engineer , Yammer : To me , trust means working with a team of people who understand the goals of their company and their roles . Everyone works hard to fill those roles effectively because they know that if everyone is aligned , everyone succeeds . This includes not only knowing your role , but also how it connects to the roles of others . Trust in the workplace boils down internalizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have to move together to be most effective , rather than islands of individuals jockeying for position . <p> Phoebe Venkat , Director , Digital and Social Media , - ADT : To me , trust means trusting your colleagues and yourself to do the right thing for the business , for ourselves , for our communities , etc . I earn trust by being transparent , direct and honest . I also make it a point to take immediate accountability for anything that 's NOT going right admitting faults and mistakes endears you to others as we all make mistakes and people naturally feel more comfortable about those that are n't  behind a " perfect " facade . <p> Miguel Garcia , Customer Success Manager , Yammer : - Trust in the workplace is freedom and encouragement to put your imagination , creativity , and passion to work . Before arriving to Yammer I worked in a lot of places that micromanaged and were never confident in letting employees run with new ideas . They wanted to play it safe and scrutinized everyone wanting to take a path less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trust from day one . Being trusted actually makes you more aware and responsible . Relationships with your colleagues become much stronger , as does your dedication to the company . <p> Ferdinand Velasco , CMIO , Texas Health Resources : Trust is critical to ensuring success in an organization . Several useful concepts are presented in Stephen M. R. Coveys book series . He uses the metaphors of taxes and dividends to describe the result of distrust and trust , respectively . Lack of trust leads to bureaucracy , which is a tax . Organizations with low trust are characterized by " office politics " : withholding information , infighting , hidden agendas , endless meetings , etc . In contrast , the dividends generated by a high trust environment foster effective collaboration and innovation , improve employee engagement and retention , and accelerate the creation of value . <p> Daniel Brunt , Customer Success Manager , Yammer : When an organizations leadership trusts its employees to collaborate openly with one another , it provides each employee an entrepreneurial position within the organization . This is not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual contributions . The organization benefits significantly as these contributions drive larger initiatives . <p> Steve Nguyen , Customer Success Manager , Yammer : For me , trust is formed through actions . Do you do what you say you 're going to do ? Are your actions consistent with the values you 've communicated are important ? If people are able to consistently demonstrate actions that align with the values theyve committed to , then trust is born . <h> How does trusting your teammates help you do your job ? <p> Marco Rogers : Most important projects take more than one person to accomplish . While the urge is strong to do a lot yourself , trusting your coworkers is about letting go of that urge . Many important tasks require multiple peoples effort , and oftentimes you must rely on other people to accomplish their tasks for you to complete yours . This creates a lot of stress in most workplaces , because you have limited visibility . Sure , hierarchies were created to force compliance , but compliance will only get you so far . Dan Pink highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is trust . <p> For the nonbelievers , Stephen Covey makes a business case for trust : <p> Individuals who trust each other do n't  expend as much of their time and energy watching their backs . They often redirect that energy towards productivity and innovation for the company . <p> When individuals are given the trust to execute , they are more likely to become engaged with company and align more with its mission . A team with high trust motivates its members t retain that trust through excellence . <p> Managers who do n't  trust their reports spend a lot of time on processes , reviews and sanctions . Employees respond to this stifling environment with apathy and reduced productivity . In environments of trust , managers can instead spend their time finding and clearing roadblocks from their team , inspiring employees to share more and work together to identify and solve pain points . <h> Can you screen for trust in an interview ? <p> Marco Rogers : You can gauge trust by seeing how the candidate reacts to subjective scenarios that play out differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talk about in engineering is how people react when another person changes your code without telling you . While its a common occurrence at Yammer and not cause for alarm in many other places , people guard their codebases and their own code very closely . The expectation is that if someone changes your code , its because you messed up or its not good enough . When the team is built on trust , everyone knows that nobody owns the code , and most code changes over time because the product has to evolve . Another important factor is whether the candidates motivations align with the company vision . For engineering , we try to determine if the candidate wants to build a great product , or if they are in it for the sake of technology alone . <h> Its easy to develop trust with people you work with daily but what about people you do n't  know ? <p> Marco Rogers : This speaks to the idea of company culture . Here at Yammer , I 'm still amazed at how we 've managed to create a culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face value colleagues I 've never met and deal with them honestly . I expect them to work with me to produce the best outcome . Information flows more freely , and any rising tension is viewed as something to be rooted out and squashed . <h> What can you do to help engender trust ? <p> Matt Ontell : For me , it always comes down to how people handle failure . When people trust each other , the focus is on minimizing damage and getting back to work . The involved parties take responsibility with little prompting , and they adjust so that everyone can see how the problem will be avoided in the future . When people do n't  trust each other , its about assigning blame and creating more process overhead to prevent recurrences . <p> A big reason why people are afraid to fail and show vulnerability is the idea of having to " save face " . Marco notes : " Publicly taking responsibility for my part in any issues helps other people feel more inclined to take their part , until everyone realizes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to move forward together . " <p> Marco Rogers : Personally , I try to be mindful of unintended interactions that breed distrust . Resetting these expectations can surface miscommunications and conflicting goals , taking the pressure off the individuals. - When either party is not confident in anothers skill or competence , there 's little room for trust . Teams , where members trust each other to execute , are inherently productivity . It does n't  mean everybody has to be at the same level , but everyone should be well suited to the roles they 're expected to play . While our hiring process is geared towards people meeting a minimum bar of skill , we also are n't  afraid to move people around to the roles where they are most effective . <p> Matt Ontell : Its helpful to consider trust as you would a bank account . When our balance is positive , others trust us , when negative , they do n't  . Some ideas for making " trust deposits " : <p> Be honest When others know your feedback focuses on attaining the same goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do n't  engage in gossip The fastest way to convince others that you ca n't be trusted is to tell them , " I shouldnt be saying this but " <p> Work transparently This enables others to understand your motivations and your thinking , as well as contribute and add their input when appropriate . <p> David Jarivs , Online Director , Specialist Holidays : - Trust is not just about doing the job ; it is about how the job is done and the confidence you build in others in trusting you to do the job . If you erode that confidence by trying to do the job in ways that people around you do n't  understand , then that tends to create problems . You must recognize that some can cope with ambiguity and/or a drip feed of information , whereas others need the full story from A-Z explained is another learning . <p> Back to you reader What does trust mean to you ? How has trust helped you do your job , or perhaps how has lack of trust hindered you ? 
@@12024616 @624616/ <h> 31 Days of Yammer : How Cbeyond Created a Spark in its Yammer Community <p> By the Yammer team , on January 3 , 2013May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> The following is a guest post by Rashida Powell , internal communication leader at Cbeyond. - <p> In October 2012 , Cbeyond reached its one-year anniversary on Yammer . We decided to do something special to recognize the occasion . Our Yammer community had come a long way in a year . In November 2011 , one month after launch , we had 400 employees in the community ; by August 2012 that number had grown to 1,470 ; and as we approached our one-year anniversary there were 1,600 employees signed up on Yammer ! We wanted to celebrate this growth , and we wanted our celebration to be meaningful and help our Yammer community continue to grow ; that is how " 31 Days of Yammer " was born . We put together a month of activities that encompassed the following . <h> What we did : <p> Daily Tip : Each day in October a daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with basic tips and worked our way up to the more advanced tips as the month progressed . <p> Tip Team : We recruited a team of employees from every department frontline to executive to be on our Tip Team . Each days Yammer tip was posted by a member of the Tip Team . This helped get more people involved than just the Yammer community managers and avid users . <p> Weekly Contests : Each week , we held a contest on Yammer that correlated with one or more of the tips shared that week . For example , the first weeks " Post Your Mug to Get a Mug " contest prompted users to upload a picture to their profile to be entered in a contest for a company branded mug . And during the third week , to be eligible for a prize in our " Get Your Yam on from ANYWHERE " contest , employees had to download Yammers mobile app . The last contest of the month correlated with our yammer tip that read : " Have fun ! " Employees were asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed for Halloween in the Water Cooler group with the #Halloween2012 tag . We held five contests total , and in each contest large groups of employees who participated won a small prize while one employee was randomly selected for a grand prize each time . <p> Yammer Header : To brand the " 31 Days of Yammer " we created headers to promote the campaign and some of the individual contests . <p> Training : During the month we held two trainings : Yammer 101 which covered the basics and Yammer 201 for Teams , Groups and Collaboration on Yammer . These sessions were hands on and participants applied what they learned on the spot . <p> Promotion : We sent one email each Monday to promote the contest of the week and used Yammer , our digital signage and e-newsletters to promote the daily tips and contests throughout the month . <p> Partnership with Yammer Customer Success Manager : Our Customer Success Manager was instrumental in helping us determine which tips and contests to include in the campaign . We wanted everything to be measurable , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could quantify . <p> Incorporation of Company Initiatives : In October , we hold our " Week of Service " when employees from all of our 15 markets engage in volunteer activities in their communities . This year we asked employees to post pictures of them out volunteering with a #2012WeekofService tag . This created a huge spike in engagement and number of file uploads that week , and because more people were going to Yammer to see and load Week of Service images , they also got involved in the " 31 Days of Yammer " activities . Below is the header we created for Week of Service : <h> Results Achieved : <p> We wanted " 31 Days of Yammer " to be fun , but we also wanted to increase participation and help our users understand how to incorporate Yammer into their daily work lives . We are happy to report the following stats : <p> 15% increase in engagement in October with 700 of your 1700 users being engaged during the month <p> Water Cooler conversation quadrupled this is n't an increase in non-work related conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company group being redirected to the right place . <h> Lessons learned : <p> here 's a summary of lessons learned through our 31 Days of Yammer campaign : <p> Be ready . Launching a campaign that has daily and weekly action items that involves multiple people can be challenging to coordinate . Have support teams established before the launch . For example , select your Tip Team in advance , have a team of people who will help distribute prizes , etc . It also helps to have headers and any supporting materials ready to go at launch . <p> Use contests to drive people to your groups . One of the challenges we had was the considerable amount of conversation happening on our main feed . Once we shared tips on how to use the groups and held contests that required people to make posts in specific groups , the conversations on the main feed decreased drastically . <p> Make it easy . If Yammer is n't part of ones job , it might not fall high on the priority list , so make it easy for people to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Team with ready-to-go posts , pictures and videos that they could copy , paste , and post . They had the freedom to edit the post to match their personal voice ; some chose to do that , some did not . <p> Make it rewarding . We thanked members of our Tip Team publicly on Yammer , sent them an email to share the results of the campaign and gave them a Yammer shirt . We wanted them to know how much we appreciated their efforts and we wanted to share how their contributions helped make a positive impact in our Yammer community . <p> Keep the momentum going . " 31 Days of Yammer " required a lot of output on our end . We realized that after 31 days of nonstop promoting , celebrating and information sharing we needed to step away let things settle down a bit but not for too long . Once you 've got their attention , keep it . Have a plan in place for what you 're going to do next . <h> What 's next for Cbeyond ? <p> We have developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Month of Health and Wellness . " We will use this month to share information about our benefits plans , health and wellness initiatives , and articles and information from third-party sources . We will also host fitness challenges . Other " month of " themes include collaboration , innovation and safety . We have a set of seven objectives that we have established for our Yammer community and all of the activities we plan will support one of those objectives . <p> The overall health of our Yammer community is solid , and we will continue to develop programs to keep the momentum going in the year to come . Our " 31 Days of Yammer " was a great way to create a spark now we just have to keep the flame going ! 2013 here we come ! <p> About Rashida Powell : <p> Rashida Powell is an internal communications leader at Cbeyond the technology ally for small to medium sized businesses that delivers cloud services and communications through its enterprise network and data centers .

@@12024633 @624633/ <h> A Day In The Life Of A Community Manager A Chat With Phoebe Venkat <p> By the Yammer team , on September 13 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Every month , we conduct an online chat in our customer community with customers leading each chat based on their areas of expertise . Last month , community manager extraordinaire Phoebe Venkat shared her expertise on you guessed it ! Community Management . Phoebe Venkat was the community manager for Tycos 24,000-person network , and is now the social media/digital director for ADT ( which still includes enterprise community management as one of her responsibilities ) . Here are the highlights of what she shared with us : <p> What does community management mean to you ? <p> To me , it means being the " bumpers " guiding , helping , connecting , leading , driving , but not dictating . At Tyco , we created the " Yammer Credo , " which establishes the rules of the road . The Credo takes an informal , yet professional , tone vs. the " command and control " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who models the behaviors we want to see flourish in the culture . If you want a culture that takes more ( calculated ) risks , how do you convince people that its okay ? You do n't  . You show them . At Tyco ( and the same with ADT ) , we want the silos between employees , managers , execs , businesses , etc. to be more permeable . Community managers help make those connections stick. - <p> What does a day in your life look like ? <p> My job was part-time in theory , but really full-time in practice . The other half of my time focused on internal and executive communication , and these two roles complimented each other well . On a daily basis , I set concrete objectives for myself , but also let the serendipity of what comes up come in and influence my thought process . I " have to have goals , " but find non-traditional ways to meet those goals . Its also important to find others that excel at things you may not be good at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT teams because they are the experts in their fields . <p> How do you encourage the quieter members to come out of their shell ? <p> With " quiet " users otherwise known as " lurkers " or " listeners " I would say do n't  spend too much time trying to convert them to post publicly . Active listeners are just as important because they tend to read and " see " more . They may even help evangelize your efforts with other listeners . Direct your quieter users to key 2-3 key working groups that can deliver value right away . They can focus on those groups and when/if they feel comfortable , jump into the " ocean " with everyone else . <p> To engage various types of users , have a public group that does n't  require public action in order for someone to get value from it . For example , at Tyco we started a public corporate news group that has 8K members . The majority simply read the articles . They do n't  have to " like " or reply to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think a better use of time is helping them promote their experience to others that may be wary like them . Keep in mind that lurker may be getting a lot of value out of their experience , too . <p> How do you onboard new members ? <p> Different tactics will work for different people . Some just need some hands-on training as they may not be currently using social tools . Others may be blocking themselves from wanting to participate by saying its " yet another thing . " Its all about helping people find catalysts to make their experience more positive . <p> What happens if someone posts something inappropriate ? <p> In the unlikely case that something posts something inappropriate , we direct them to review the Credo and explain that Yammer is business tool . Any company rules are valid whether you 're on a conference call or on Yammer . When necessary , we loop in HR and the persons manager , but this is very rare . <p> I had a private " jokes " group that was posting inappropriate content . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call and walked them through why we launched yammer . They told me that they were the only ones using yammer on their team . I realized they just needed guidance and some " atta boys . " I also told them that our president paid for Yammer = The troublemakers then went back to their Jokes group and told them to calm down and post clean content . They subsequently started business-driven groups and expanded their use of Yammer . <p> How do you guide people to post things that move the conversation forward ? <p> What if content posted is not inappropriate , but is considered less valuable by other members ? Guiding noisy folks involves modeling the behaviors you want to see . Focus on positive reinforcement for those that seem to be doing it right instead of swatting those over the head . <p> How do you help people communicate across languages and cultures ? <p> Tyco translates key exec messages into 15 languages , so that everyone gets official news . Its important to encourage bilingual users to post in their native language and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and country-based groups where native speakers can converse , but they are also encouraged to start conversations in other groups , including the company feed , in their native language . <p> How does a company know it needs a community manager ? <p> I think you need one overall CM , as well as a mix of Yambassadors ( informal champions ) and communications leads . At Tyco , there are several business units , so its important to have those BU co-community managers play a key role . <p> The CM is valuable because she or he is on the pulse of employee sentiment . We are valuable advisors in the " trenches , " and a lot of time can get more authentic feedback from employees because of our visibility . Some execs may not have time to filter through all the posts , so the CM serves as a liaison that can easily bubble up key themes to execs . <p> What makes a good community manager ? <p> Number one most important characteristic is to be 1000% transparent . You have to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make sense of it without taking it personally . Believe me , there are times when you get upset , but you have to be able to make it work for the greater good . And when you misspeak , be honest about it . You have to admit when you 're wrong , do it quickly , and make amends when necessary . That helps build trust with people you may never meet in person . Additionally , the community manager has to be connected , empathetic , fast , a ( smart ) risk taker , and fun ! - <p> Do you have any advice for a new community manager ? <p> I would recommend that you surface likeminded champions Yambassadors , as I call them - of employees across the business to help guide others . Its good to have a cross mix of functions , titles , and experience levels especially in huge , highly matrixed organizations . <p> For more of Phoebes wisdom , please check out her talk from last years Pivot Conference : 
@@12024641 @624641/ <p> With bold steps like launching Westfield Labs- to drive social and mobile innovation across its global stores , the Westfield Group is innovating to stay relevant with customers , employees and partners . <p> One of the companys digital pioneers is Andy Hedges , the Director of Shopping Center Management at Westfield Australia . Andy is the person ultimately responsible for making sure that all of the Westfield centers create the best experiences for their retailers and ultimately shoppers . Andy is also a huge advocate of social media , a Yammer champion at Westfield , and Yammers Customer of the Month in November ! <p> At Westfield , Andy is in charge of aligning and energizing store leadership across Australia . Before Yammer , he ran a physical forum , an in-person gathering of about 80 people to help translate strategy into action , surface issues , exchange best practices and energize store leadership . A lot of the conversations that were previously limited to in-person events now happen on Yammer , all year round . <h> Leadership 2.0 <p> When talking about leadership development , Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant change . Leadership 2.0 is all about openness , transparency and accountability ; its about enabling employees to do their best , instead of blocking them . As a result , leaders are approachable and organizations are flatter . Yammer helps him put this worldview in practice ; he has conversations on Yammer that would be difficult to have otherwise . Without Yammer , he may visit some centers once a year , walk the floor for a few hours and hear presentations its not enough time to uncover real issues and dig deeply . <p> As an executive , Andy is aware that his behavior on Yammer helps others model their behaviors . Because employees may be nervous posting on Yammer in front of executives , adopting a conversational and collaborative style becomes important . Andy passes all of his communication through the " Clint Eastwood test of writing , " which means that he only uses the words that he needs . " By ditching fancy jargon in favor of simple communication , you can relate to your audience easier . Its not about using fancy words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimidated , " says Andy . For an executive communicator , what to post is just as important as how to post . On Yammer , Andy often posts relevant news , articles , and longer-style communication that sits somewhere between a blogpost and a tweet . This allows for a deeper conversation and a longer line of vision into the world of the executive . Andy says that posting personal information , such as photos of kids , makes him more approachable and thus able to collaborate deeper . <h> Working together to solve problems <p> Yammer started at Westfield Australia because of a need to connect people across shopping centers and the Support Office ( Andy calls HQ a Support Office to signal its purpose to the organization ) . As a result of working together , employees on the ground are able to identify problems , come up with and implement solutions , and involve the Support Office to solve the problem in a programmatic way . <p> To give an example , several stores identified a problem with a Westfield Gift Card through customer feedback and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a communication issue around redemption codes , and a physical issue that placed the code too close to the magnetic stripe , preventing the stripe from working . By working together , store managers created a revised communications package for retailers and consumers , and looped in the Support Office quickly to physically relocate codes . " If I had n't  seen it on Yammer , it would have been a bigger issue . Because I saw it there , I could take care of it quickly ( dragged GM into office right away ! ) and get it resolved much faster for the people on the ground . Without Yammer , I may not have even seen this issue ; it saved at least 6 weeks of pain , " shared Andy . <h> A networked world <p> With its strategic investments in mobile and social , Westfield intends to create an environment where the Support Office , the store manager and the retailer can work together towards the same goal a better shopper experience . This takes purposeful communication , for which trust is necessary . " Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a community , " says Andy . " Now , things are more transient , there are more chain stores and each employee stays around for 6-12 months . " Operating under the belief that if people knew each other better , theyd work better together , Andy is driving the community efforts through Yammer , inside and across shopping centers . <p> These communities are driving tangible business results . Store managers and retailers share best practices , solve problems , celebrate achievements and even share security tips . By working together , a few of the retailers even helped police apprehend users of fraudulent credit cards . A mobile communication channel becomes critical in times of emergency ; using Yammer as a mobile lifeline , a shopping center manager effectively informed the centers retailers of a delay in trading hours caused by a power plant failure . <p> Please join us in congratulating Andy and his team on bringing the vision of mobile and social a little closer to reality and learn more about Yammer at Westfield : @qwx171301 @qwx171306

( Part I ) <p> By the Yammer team , on May 22 , 2013May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> There 's something of a revolution happening in the way organizations are using Yammer in call centers and help desks around the world today and its gathering momentum . Tech-savvy companies are finding that the " Social Service Desk " is playing an ever-important role in the way help desks are run and in the way they provide services to internal and external customers . <p> At Yammer were committed to helping organizations deliver customer satisfaction to employees , clients and partners . Through the innovative use of Yammer networks , a social service desk can come to fruition . Let 's take a closer look at how the social service desk is having a disruptive effect in call centers around the world . <p> Types of Service Desks &amp; Todays Current Challenges Call centers and services desk are used by most organizations in some form or another : to resolve IT issues , to procure products and services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service desks . The first is a transactional type of service desk that focuses on high volume , non-technical requests . Typical examples are consumer services such as utilities , banking and telecommunications . The second type is a technical service desk that focuses on specialized software or services provided to other organizations . Both types will have underlying software in order to log , track and resolve any requests or tickets that are raised . <p> Due to the complexity and intricacies of call centers , staff members may frequently encounter challenges . Call center agents as well as customers may encounter some of the following problems : <p> Finding an expert who can help . In order to find an answer , calls are placed , tickets are logged and customers are passed from contact to contact until the right person is reached . <p> Call centers have to deliver quality service that meets customer satisfaction levels while working with a restricted or limited budget . <p> Customers often spend time waiting in queues with multiple menu options to get help , even when they require a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a way of easily tapping into similar requests that have been made . Information and knowledge needed may be difficult to find . <p> When call center agents move into a different role it is difficult to retain the knowledge of that individual to benefit the community in the future . <p> So where does Yammer fit into the picture and how do Enterprise Social Networks help ? <p> How Yammer Helps Yammer acts a social layer above your service desk software and allows call center agents to accelerate the way in which requests are processed and resolved . Let 's take a closer look at some of the ways your Yammer network can help . <p> Agent Relationships : - Traditional call center models are hierarchical , with a 1st line , 2nd and 3rd line type of setup . With Yammer , agents can connect directly with experts , allowing a request to be resolved faster than a traditional approach . In addition to quicker resolution timelines , this allows the team to have multiple relationships with the experts . <p> Expertise : - Finding experts is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their personal profile section . If an agent is looking for a specialist in PCs or O365 , they can quickly use the search function and find an expert . Finding experts that can help ultimately means getting to an answer sooner . <p> Knowledge Sharing : - ESNs can be used to share information quickly and efficiently . This can mean sharing successes in resolving an issue or sharing strategies to manage customer interactions . By sharing stories , - the rest of your team can learn and benefit from those experiences . Typically , sharing successes and information is missing from traditional call center systems today . With Yammer , your network becomes a knowledge hub that can easily tapped into by every call center agent . <p> What a Social Service Desk Can Do for You Its clear a social service desk can help to provide better service and give agents more tools to help customers . So what can you do to get started ? <p> Crowdsource answers to customer questions : Using Yammer to draw on the knowledge of the whole team can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ask questions and get answers , use search to find existing knowledge and avoid the need to escalate . <p> Set up YammerFall so employees can see what questions are being asked to gain ambient awareness of trending issues . <p> Capture and share customer feedback : - Customer feedback captured by call center operatives in Yammer can be quickly shared with sales , , arketing and product development teams to improve the customer experience . <p> Improve engagement and productivity : - Yammer gives everyone in the organization a voice to improve employee engagement , leading to higher motivation and productivity among call center operatives while also improving customer satisfaction . <p> Capture knowledge in a role with a high turnover : - Call centers typically experience high turnover so capturing experiences in Yammer is a great way to retain knowledge and speed up the onboarding of new hires . <p> Connect team leaders : - Connecting team leaders through Yammer enables them to share advice for getting the best from their teams and spot customer trends together . <p> Connect with employees in other departments : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues in different departments to get answers to technical questions . <p> Recognizing performance or leadership : Representatives are usually evaluated on call time and the number of calls attended to .

The new features and improved interface are more intuitive , which aids with increased take-up , " said Gareth Burkill-Howarth , Head of Global Projects at Kinetic Worldwide . <p> In addition to the platform launch , were also redesigning the Yammer interface to support the platform and new types of content that come with it . Conversations are still at the center of Yammer , but now messages will be organized in four main feeds : My feed , Direct Messages , Company feed , and @ Mentions . Extending our current functionality to include the full range of conversation types , we will offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Activity feed will enable users to pull in automated updates from existing enterprise applications , streamlining business communication and processes accessible via one platform . <p> At Yammer , we believe that human capital is the most valuable asset in any organization , but organizational structure often stands in the way of engagement , performance and productivity . Our product is intended to help facilitate knowledge capture and exchange , so that companies can harness the true power of the workforce . The platform combined with the new look and feel of Yammer makes it easier for employees to communicate and collaborate with one another , ultimately changing the way people work . <p> It was just two years ago when we took the stage at TechCrunch 50 and launched Yammer to the world . Weve come a long way since then , and were looking forward to retracing our roots at the upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt event where our founder and CEO , David Sacks , will unveil the platform and the new user interface .

@@12024646 @624646/ <h> Working Social : Driving Employee Adoption of Social Business <p> By the Yammer team , on May 22 , 2014May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> In the third post of this series , I wrote about how to drive executive engagement and alignment around your social business strategy and initiatives . In this post , well be taking a closer look at how to drive adoption by employees and how this new level of engagement will transform the organization . <p> The Field of Dreams Fallacy <p> I see many organizations taking what I call a " field of dreams " approach to working social they believe that " If I build it , They will come . " The " they " referenced here is employees , supposedly drawn to a collaboration or social networking platform by the promise of cross-department conversations , the ability to post anything they want and hear the latest from around the company . So the organizers flip the switch , and sit in anticipation of the enlightened engagement . <p> And at first , their efforts may be rewarded great promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give it a try . " Its working ! They 're coming ! " the program managers exclaim , as they show admin reports of the number of users and " hits " to their executive sponsors . <p> But in fairly short order , they stop coming by as often . The nature of the conversations is usually superficial , and after a few weeks or months , only the hard core in a few specific , niche areas are still active . Like the movie Field of Dreams , the players only stopped by for a short while and disappeared back into the cornfield . <p> Building Sustainable Adoption Requires Rethinking Relationships <p> What happened was that the implementation focused on pushing the platform , rather than the purpose . In an attempt to try to get broad participation and adoption , social business strategists often water down the benefits to the lowest common denominator conversations , engagement , posts that can be easily measured in platform dashboards . <p> As I discussed in the first post of this series , its crucial to have a goal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also think through what adoption really means to the overall relationship between the employee and your organization . That 's because social business opens up communication lines and sets employee expectations that if not met , will lead to discontinued use . <p> One of the most interesting dynamics is the change in what I call the " perceived power distance " between executives at the top of the organization and employees at the front lines . I once worked with an executive team at a technology company that was having problems driving adoption of their collaboration platform . I asked the 20 member executive team how many of them were using the platform and only one hand went up . Despite all of the excellent planning , the detailed goal setting , they had n't  thought through the one factor that drives repeat engagement knowing that your personal participation made a difference . <p> When Red Robin , the US-based restaurant chain with 450 locations wanted to engage employees , their research informed that that they werent communicating enough with employees . But Chris Laping , Red Robins CIO and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Initially , we thought that meant staff wanted more from management , more memos and meetings . Then we realized that what people were saying was n't so much , We want to hear more , but we want to be heard . ' " <p> This wasnt just about employees talking with each other , it was a way for them to interact and engage with people across all levels of the organization but especially their executives and leaders . By simply engaging in the conversation , managers and executives were validating that their voices mattered . <p> Quelling Nervous Leaders Nerves , - <p> So let 's modify the " Field of Dreams " approach to " If You Show Up , They Will Come . " In case after case of our research , the number one way to drive employee adoption is to first drive executive adoption AND engagement . This is not easy and here are a few example statements Ive heard from leaders from all levels of the organization : <p> " What if they challenge a decision I 've made ? It will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Im worried that if my team members can talk to my department head , I 'll be cut out of the loop . " <p> " They will make suggestions and I 'll have to say No over and over again . I 'll look like the bad guy . " <p> " I 'm too busy getting real work done to log in . " <p> As I explained in the third post , executive engagement and alignment is crucial but at this stage , it gets really personal . These leaders are truly nervous about how they will act and perform as a leader in these new relationships . Your leadership AND your employees will need guidelines for this new type of relationship , etiquette will need to be established and training provided . Start with a goal , show employees how they can interact with the platform , but most importantly , set expectations about how you 're listen to their input . <p> In the last post of this series , well look at how to tie everything together with the right metrics to measure the impact of your social business initiatives . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

Through data scientific measuring and testing , Yammers team of data analysts and marketers work together to grow a product that is based on actual user value and engagement . By creating and enhancing features that are specific to the user experience , Yammer has the ability of creating a virtual workspace that is intuitive . <p> To understand the importance of data driven marketing and the fundamentals of how it is used at Yammer , Director of Analytics , Peter Fishman and Data Analyst , Vincent Yates spoke candidly in regards to the importance of this methodology : <p> Q : What is data science and what skills are needed in order to become a data scientist ? <p> To be a data statistician , you 'll need the statistical skills of Nate Silver , the programming skills of Mark Zuckerberg , and the product vision of Steve Jobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use analytics and advancing models to evolve the product and drive the way we market it to real people . <p> Q : Which scientific approaches do the marketing and analytics teams use to help Yammer become ubiquitous across the world ? <p> ( V ) Yammers primary way of spreading is through virality , meaning our user base is our marketing department . - We depend on the fact that our users invite their peers because they are getting real value out of the software on a regular basis . The more peers who use Yammer together , the more value each user gets . <p> The marketing and analytics teams work together to identity and utilize any marketing channel that will attract the right type of users- people that will voluntarily adopt and benefit from the software and who will invite their friends and colleagues . <p> ( V ) We not only monitor how well the marketing campaign performs in the short term ( I.e. click-through rates ) , but we also gauge how it impacts a users behavior within the product- an indication of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this by measuring " engagement , " a series of metrics that assess how a user uses the product differently after seeing the marketing campaign . For example , we observe how often they return to the product and what features they interact with . This way , we can evaluate the campaign from a more scientific and user-focused perspective . <p> Q : Do you believe there is a correlation between current user engagement and predicting future usage trends of Yammer ? <p> ( F ) Yes , we believe there is a correlation and it is proven in the data . Its interesting that as we track and measure engagement , we see more features that are aimed at improving those numbers . We sort the things we do as a function of the things that we track . At every step , we ask ourselves " will this actually encourage the users to use the product ? " - The key is to change the mindsets in some sense . <p> Q : Where do you see data driven marketing in the future ? <p> ( V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with data . Some are targeting behaviors and delivering ads that are modeled towards consumer behavior . Through segmentation and clever prediction , companies are able to generate more specific ads . The missing piece to this methodology is measuring the actual change in behavior and adjusting accordingly , frequently , and quickly . <p> At Yammer , we focus on engagement- something we are good at . We are actually able to quantify the precise impact of anything and everything we do at Yammer- every feature , every design , every marketing campaign . Through experimental design , we have the ability to improve and enhance the product iteratively based on real user experience and behavior . <p> So what makes this all unique ? Simply , the vitality of data science and marketing together has allowed us to build and market Yammer around the actual value a user gets out of it . As Fishman would say : " To achieve and build up towards value , there must be a transparent system in which we are able to market , measure , and be as effective as possible .

( Part II ) <p> By the Yammer team , on May 23 , 2013May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> In our last post , we discussed the benefits of a social service desk . By serving customers socially , companies are able to crowdsource answers , share feedback , capture knowledge , recognize top performers and more . Many of our customers are discovering these benefits in their organizations . Let 's take a look at how some of our customers are using Yammer in call centers . <p> Customer Stories So what are Yammers customers doing with Yammer and how are they using their networks in call centers ? Weve taken some of the best stories , as told to our Customer Engagement team . Here they are ! <p> An Oxfordshire-based company provides outsourced service desk and infrastructure support services to companies in the Fortune 500 . Internally they are using Yammer to connect multilingual call agents in global locations and transform the way they deliver support services . Team leaders use Yammer to send daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff are available for customers 24/7 . Within the services , agents collaborate and share knowledge via Yammer , therefore improving service delivery . They are also working with their customers some of whom have service desks with hundreds of staff and thousands of end-users to add Yammer as a social layer to existing service desk models . This has helped to flatten traditional structures , reduce escalations and improve service resolution times , as well foster communities aligned around shared goals . Theyve gone one step further and set up an external customer network designed to improve their relationship with their clients and provide more personal service . Splendid ! <p> A provider of sales and merchandising solutions in South Africa is using Yammer in its service centers to reconnect customers with the reps who were originally helping them if and when their calls are disconnected . By posting the customer name and query in Yammer , they are able to reduce wasted time for both the reps and the customers and create a more streamlined customer experience . Marvelous ! <p> An IT services provider in Belgium that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent technical problems . They have seen faster response times with experts offering advice and colleagues looping in others who have relevant - knowledge . Yammer has also helped employees stay productive while working from home . Because Yammer can be accessed without VPN and through mobile apps , people have the flexibility to work from anywhere and stay connected . Outstanding ! <p> A provider of housing services is using Yammer to help employees quickly get answer by creating an IT group . IT employers can now simply post a question in the group and get answers faster than the traditional way of opening tickets . This has changed the way employees interact with the IT team and improved the way team members interact with one another . But it does n't  stop there . The IT team has gone the extra mile and now also helps employees with any IT issues they may encounter at home , too . Fantastic ! <p> A major business travel agency is looking to go big with Yammer by getting over 80% of its workforce of 20,000 started with a social service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence groups and to connect with preferred suppliers . Industry groups will be created to share insights , news and intelligence related to specific industries . As a result , the teams will be able to quickly share knowledge and gain greater insight into what is happening in the customer industry while also providing a higher level of personalized customer service . A " Preferred Supplier Network " has been created as a Yammer external network to enable employees to connect directly with preferred suppliers such as airline and hotel chains . A different supplier is featured each month , providing an opportunity for the supplier to improve awareness of their products and services and for employees to ask questions directly to the supplier . Some suppliers also run competitions during the month . The result is that employees gain greater knowledge about a suppliers products and services and can provide better service through informed flight and hotel recommendations . Fantastic ! <p> A major transportation provider based in Europe is shaking up how this company provides IT services for its employees . The mandate was easy : how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT service desk while increasing the quality of service provided to our end users ? Today the organization estimates that it costs G15 per call made to the help desk . Since the team receives thousands of calls per year , even a small percentage of calls could help reduce costs significantly . The team created an IT forum group where people can post questions and search for answers before calling the help desk . The team is eager to see how this will impact overall call volumes and - costs . Amazing ! <p> How you can get started today ? So how can your organization can benefit from the Social Service Desk ? Weve taken the experiences of all our customers worldwide and outlined three easy steps that your help desk or call center can start using Yammer : - - - - 1. - - - - - Get started by creating a - group such as " IT Forum , " or simply " Help Desk " - - - - 2. - - - - - Add useful and relevant documents or content- - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group and start Yammering ! <p> Congrats , youve just created the foundation of your Social Service Desk ! <p> We hope these stories inspire your organization to start working social . But there 's even more you can do with Yammer . You can build an entire service desk ecosystem that integrates your call center system into Yammer , or build an entire community-based service approach for fielding first line requests before tickets are opened . If you 're interested , we 'd love to talk to you to and help make that happen .

These everyday heroes and their teams ( Yammer is a team sport ! ) lead and inspire . Jessica Elliott is a Communications and Deployment Manager at Red Robin and is Januarys customer of the month . Jessicas passion , vision and enthusiasm are contagious ; check out her story in her own words : <p> **40;818;TOOLONG <p> Red Robin has a unique culture . <p> Now , a lot of companies say that , but in my experience , Red Robin really walks that walk . When I started with the company 12 years ago , though I was sure I would still be in love with the veggie burger ( a.k.a. the reason I applied ) , I did not anticipate that I would still be so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lot of ways we celebrate and recognize unbridled acts ( ways that our Team Members take care of each other and our Guests ) to start every meeting . We infuse our core values into conversations about and decisions pertaining to the business . And most importantly we believe in our people , and that when we take great care of our Team Members first , they will take care of our Guests ( and as a company , we will reward our shareholders ) . Though our brand is well-recognized and over 40 years old , in the past few years , we have taken on initiatives that allow our business to evolve in a really exciting way . Our business is hyper-competitive and requires flexibility and agility . <p> But no matter how exciting or needed a change may be , its success lies with the people who execute it . Yammer is changing the way we change . <p> My role is communications and deployment manager , and that means that I 'm working with our Team Members every day to evolve the brand . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of our communication centers around keeping the lights on . Communication is n't designed for the sender , its designed for the receivers . Memos , rollout books and emails serve the sender . Which is why Yammer works for us ; it allows us to speak with our teams in a way that they communicate point-in-time , multi-directional , small bite , direct and in-direct , multi-media , should I go on ? Though Yammer is a tool that our team needed to better communicate and deploy initiatives , it is because what we get out of it : better connections with the teams who are delivering our brands promise to our Guests . <p> To me , the part of our Yammer story that I get jazzed to tell is the way that we can engage our most powerful asset , our people . We use Yammer to provide a forum for questions , feedback and resources ( whether they be documents , media or people ) . - On top of that , our Team Members are constantly coming up with new ways to use Yammer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) to stay connected with each other and the organization . <p> Never before would we be able to deploy a video of our CEO speaking directly to Team Members in a way that it could get 400 views in the first weekend . We have used Yammer to connect our managers with each other , and with the business in a way that we have n't done in the past . On the horizon , we extend those connections to all of our Team Members through a coming soon network Yummmerversity . We are so psyched to supplement our learning and development and communication efforts by reaching Team Members directly in this network . <p> We are on a journey at Red Robin that Yammer is letting us bring our- most important stakeholders , our Team Members , on board with . I 've never been more excited to be a part of the Red Robin team than I am to be a part of our story today ( well , maybe the day I got my first veggie burger with my Team Member discount ) .

@@12024654 @624654/ <h> Have You Had Your Daily Dose of Yams Yet ? <p> By the Yammer team , on March 10 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> This post was written by Maria Ogneva , Yammers Head of Community <p> What would you think if you came into work on a Monday to find a sweet potato on your desk ? This is exactly what happened to the all employees at the GA Communication Group office in Chicago . Conceived by Jason Dittmer , GAs Director of Technology and one of the Yammer network admins , these literal yams were a celebration of the Yammer network launch . While most yams we think about in a business setting are internal Yammer status updates or tweets with a #yam hashtag , these particular yams were quite literally sweet potatoes . <p> A Yam-tastic Accident <p> Like many good ideas , this one was born out of an accident . Jason was in the process of launching the Yammer network at GA and putting together a policy with Colette Hinckley , the Yammer Customer Success Manager ( those are the super-smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most out of their Yammer experience ) . The internal community was n't supposed to launch until Monday , but invites accidentally went out last Thursday . Jason told me on the phone that he had to quickly scramble to align with the Operations VP , align all group leaders , and to get a mass email in place introducing Yammer . This way , invited users werent left in the dark for too long , wondering what this Yammer thing was all about . <p> Have You Had Your Daily Dose of Yams Yet ? <p> Being part of a very creative agency , Jason knew that he had an opportunity to turn this blooper into something creative and viral . So he decided to create a funny and memorable card highlighting the benefits of using Yammer , without sounding too pedantic . Thankfully , in an agency , there are many creative writers on-hand who excel at great copy . And so the " Have you had your daily dose of Yams yet ? " meme was born . <p> There was just one thing remaining to do go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason snuck in on Saturday , placing a yam on top of a card on every single desk in the Chicago office . Thats dedication ! <p> On Monday , most GA folks came in and scratched their heads at the sight of these very literal yams on their desks . Of course , the card was there to explain everything . As the day wore on , folks in the office started to trade yams , and some started to collect them . <p> Some even made faces on top of their yams , decorated their yams , documenting the process via photos and sharing them via Yammer . Someone even created a lyrical throwback to an 80s song " I think Im turning yammamese " , and the rest of the team chimed in " I really think so ! " <p> And here 's the even awesomer finish to an awesome story : all the yams were collected at the end of the day and sent to a local charity . Now that 's a yam you can feel good about ! <p> Yams Are Good For Business <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations of all size use their internal Yammer networks is to drive business results . What was the motivation behind GA starting its Yammer network ? - The GA Yammer network was set up to ensure that the main offices in Chicago and San Diego , and every remote and traveling employee in between , were able to keep in touch , communicate and collaborate effectively . <p> At the time of this writing and since Yammer launched ( officially on Monday , but accidentally last Thursday night ) , 78% of employees had signed up in just 4 business days ( with some people out of the office ) ! In the same short 4 days , there have been over 400 messages passed across this network . Active usership has been averaging 20-40 yams per day , and most people have filled out their profile , which is no small feat . Major use cases for this network emerged as : posting information on what 's going on in the office , reaching out to others to get stuff done ( suggestions , questions , crowdsourcing ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exciting is GAs plans to expand this to the main method ofinternal communication. - Jason hopes that Yammer will replace the traditional Monday status email updates , to make the process more informative , collaborative and interactive . <p> Lessons I Learned From Talking to Jason : <p> Mistakes happen to all of us , regardless of line of work or industry . Especially with social tools ( internal or external ) , news travels far and fast , and you cant always " undo " something . Instead , leverage mishaps into opportunities . <p> When launching an initiative , let people know what 's in it for them , and why they should care . Give examples of what you want people to do vs. placing too many restrictions on them Jason clearly outlined the types of Yams that were possible in the Yam card . <p> Set guidelines , but be creative . You do n't  want to create another boring " to do " . Placing a yam or any other food on peoples desks may or may not translate into your culture , but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage inforgraphic <p> When first setting up a social network like Yammer , virality and initial engagement is key . Jason succeeded in getting 78% of his agency onto the platform ( remote and on-site ) , which is no small feat ! Afterwards , sustaining this engagement among current users , as well as getting new users , are also non-trivial tasks , but that 's a topic for another blogpost. - I certainly plan to follow up with Jason to see how things are going in the GA Yammer community over time . <p> This story is a great case study of how any company can jump-start its internal collaboration efforts . A lot of our clients are large globally distributed firms , and placing yams on each others desks is simply impractical . However , doing something creative within the context of your organization is within reach for everyone . <p> How I discovered this story is also a relevant side-note . Jason alerted Collette about the yam initiative , complete with photos , which she posted on our internal Yammer network . Unfortunately , I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for missing this yam altogether , if it was n't for Yammers Jessica Halper , who made sure to @ message me in a comment to make sure I saw it . Of course , I just had to reach out to Jason the very next day , and Collette brokered the introduction . So , you see , I did n't  create this story , or even discover it , but I 'm able to bring it to you because of the power of internal and external collaboration . I just love when a good story comes together ! @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024657 @624657/ <h> Why Every Company Needs an Enterprise Social Network <p> By the Yammer team , on June 7 , 2011June 28 , 2017 0Shares <p> Culture and morale are undoubtedly two of the most important things we consider when joining a new company ( or at least we should ) . I think most of us are familiar with the Mike Judge film Office Space . If you are anything like me , your first association to the film is : " Umm yeah , I 'm gon na need you to " Its something that 's definitively " Office Space " and characteristic of that culture . Through the years , this film has become a classic cult hit with young working professionals across America . It is the epitome of what a work environment should not be . <p> Culture and Morale <p> The Office Space example is a perfect lead-in to my own experiences.Previous to joining Yammer , I 've worked in the high tech industry for the past 8 years . I have had my fair share of experiences at various companies . One thing I know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of your work . As you work for various companies , I 'm sure you will begin to notice the differences between each company , be it working styles , management personalities , culture or morale . If the company has a weak culture and does n't  offer an open and productive way to connect with your coworkers , then you probably would n't put in the 100% that you should be putting in . I truly believe that motivation and morale are key drivers for workplace performance . I know that if I were working at a company , I would want to connect with my coworkers , address issues directly to top management and provide innovative ideas. - To attract and retain top talent , companies need to realize the importance of providing employees with a sense of community , a place where culture can live and flourish . <p> Collaborative Environment And On-boarding <p> I can honestly say that the companies where I have worked that did n't  have an internal social " hub " like Yammer , wouldve benefited tremendously from it . Not only would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it also would have opened up the traditionally top-down communication between employees and managers . <p> I have firsthand seen that introduction to culture begins with on boarding. - As early as your first week in the job , you should have at least some idea of what the working environment is like . The tone of your manager , as well as your teams communication style and chemistry , can both tell you a lot about the culture of a company . As I started out at Yammer nearly a year and half ago , I was in a new role , at a new company . Coming into my role , I had no real clue as to where to go for information , or who to ask for help . Traditionally , you would normally send out an email , pick up the phone or walk around the office looking for assistance . Not at Yammer . I learned pretty quickly , most of the information I was looking for was already in Yammer , ready to be absorbed by a recent new hire like myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the benefits of Yammer in helping you get up to speed quicker and find answers instantly . A benefit almost any new hire would love ! <p> Executive Involvement <p> Culture , morale and on-boarding do not just improve overnight . Much of this is driven by a certain department in your company , or in most cases , the executive level group . Executive support and sponsorship are key , and its reassuring as I work with many large Enterprise customers that this is becoming a reality . A few customers I am closely working with have full support of the Executive staff , which really makes a difference in adoption of an enterprise social network . <p> As executives continue to participate and expand the adoption of their enterprise social network , they will begin to see the value their employees are deriving , by being able to form cohesive relationships , share best practices , connect in real-time and maintain a sense of community . All this simply can not be done through e-mail , over the phone or in person . Do n't  get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seeing someone in real-life. - However , making those real-life connections , especially at organizations with 10,000 or 20,000 employees is not realistic . I have spoken to customers who have made a number of connections with people through Yammer without ever meeting face to face . These are the type of working relationships that could not have been made , had the company not rolled out an enterprise social network , where employees can come together to share information and knowledge . In todays globally distributed climate and work-from-home culture , connecting people is key . <p> In Closing ... <p> Even though a tool like Yammer has great virality built in naturally , with low thresholds to entry , executive sponsorship remains very important . The reality is , that if executives within the company are not embracing a tool like Yammer , then employees at the bottom level probably will not either . Here are a few of the reasons why I feel culture is so important at any company and why giving your employees a tool like Yammer is valuable . An enterprise social network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Allows management to better recognize contribution and highlight top performers , in a more open and collaborative way . <p> Gives employees a place to voice ideas , get heard and provide feedback . <p> Reduces e-mail volume . <p> Allows to share important information with your co-workers . <p> De-silos information and provides better awareness of what others are working on . <p> Spurs innovation . <p> Flattens the organization . <p> I hope you found this post useful ! I would love to hear how you have used a tool like Yammer to embrace change and a shift in culture at your- organization . 
@@12024658 @624658/ <h> Yammer Helps in Times of Crisis <p> By the Yammer team , on September 7 , 2010May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> It has been nine years since the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks , five years since Hurricane Katrina , almost a year since the Haiti earthquake and just a few months since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . In times of crisis , organizations need a way to broadcast critical updates to their constituents quickly and effectively , and its crucial that employees have a way to virtually connect to one another in an emergency . Yammer provides a way for companies and organizations to connect all of their employees on a single , secure , private network where members can easily distribute important messages in the moments that matter most . <p> With a host of mobile applications , Yammer allows employees to stay connected even when away from the office . Critical information and security alerts can be broadcasted to the entire organization in real-time . In a recent blog post on enterprise microlearning , Marcia Conner , a Partner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Virginia Tech Massacre that occurred in 2007 . Following the tragic event , people began to wonder whether their organization had a means to quickly communicate to everyone in the event of a crisis . You can think of Yammer as a modern Public Address system . Students and faculty alike are connected in a secure network with the ability to share critical news . <p> In the aftermath of a crisis , it is just as critical that members of an organization have the ability to keep in close contact . The U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife Services has selected Yammer to facilitate communication among the various entities involved with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup efforts in the Gulf of Mexico . Leveraging Yammers Communities product , various agencies will be able to connect in one central location to discuss ideas , ask questions , find expertise and share information related to the oil spill cleanup . Because the crisis necessitates many people working in the field , Yammer is an effective solution since users can access the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via SMS . <p> But this is n't the first time an organization has turned to Yammer to help manage a crisis . Earlier this year , the east coast of the United States endured an unprecedented winter . Washington D.C. was hit with a blizzard , taking students out of school and professionals out of the office for days . The District of Columbia employed Yammer to facilitate working remotely during the whiteout . " Yammer has provided another communications channel for people to quickly post updates , post messages about things they are looking for , and push it out to a group of people that they normally would n't communicate with , " said Brian Sivak , CTO of the District of Columbia . Despite the paralysis caused by the blizzard , District of Columbia employees across 15 agencies were able to continue working , leveraging Yammer as a virtual office . <p> Communication is at the center of effective crisis management . Solutions like Yammer play a vital role in quickly disseminating news and keeping all stakeholders updated . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024661 @624661/ <p> We have discussed the importance of adoption events to the success of enterprise social network adoption a few times . A successful adoption event informs users of the benefits of using the ESN , models desired behaviors , increases awareness and establishes a call to action . An example of a really creative launch came to my attention , and I just had to get to know the company that made its own Yammer shirts ( and sent me one ! ) , and baked Yammer cupcakes . That company was Hall &amp; Wilcox , a law firm in Melbourne , Australia . I caught up with Yammer champions Josephine Murfey and Chris Warburton at Hall &amp; Wilcox , and this is what we talked about . <h> Maria Ogneva : Thanks for spending some time with us today . Can you introduce yourselves and tell us what you do at Hall &amp; Wilcox ? <p> Josephine Murfey : I am the Knowledge Manager , and I have worked here for 11 years , managing the library and the vast body of knowledge created by our lawyers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means that I provide technology systems to lawyers . I manage the intranet , Yammer , SharePoint , and other systems , making sure that our systems talk to each other . I make sure that the lawyers have all they need , and translate " tech " to English , so the users do n't  have to . <h> MO : Can you tell us a little bit about Hall &amp; Wilcox ? <p> JM : We are a law firm located in Melbourne . We are located in one building but span across 5 floors . We have 240 employees , which includes 120 lawyers and support staff . <h> MO : How did you discover Yammer ? <p> CW : Our CEO heard Pete Williams talk about Yammer and became immediately interested and inspired by the promise of open sharing and collaboration . So we created the network . People were immediately interested ; they signed up and logged in viral adoption at its best ! It got so popular that it caught the attention of the IT manager . As an organisation , we initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up being blocked until we could investigate it further . <p> JM : The IT manager wanted to build our own social network . Since there was such a demonstrated need for a communication platform like this , the IT manager thought that a homegrown network would do well . However , it did n't  have the same appeal as Yammer did , and employees stopped using it , and it was slowing down our entire Intranet load time . We eventually re-introduced Yammer . We attached it to the front of the intranet and re-launched over Christmas . Lawyers are n't  usually the frontrunners of technology adoption , but they jumped at the opportunity to use Yammer , and we are now up to 240 users , which is pretty much our whole company . <h> MO : How did you get so many users on Yammer ? <p> JM : We had to create some compelling launch events to let people know about Yammer and get people excited . We launched Yammer during Christmas last year , and so we made Yammer lollipops , cupcakes and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris even dressed up as Father Christmas ! <p> CW : And I still blame you for that ! <h> MO : Did you fear that a launch before a long holiday break could mean the possibility of losing some momentum ? <p> JM : Yes , exactly ! To address this , we created a whole competition that could keep going during the holiday break . We gave all employees custom t-shirts and asked them to take a photo of themselves wearing the t-shirts over the break and upload the photos to Yammer . Having employees upload photos into the mobile interface illustrated Yammers mobile power something that the old microblog couldnt do . here 's a copy of the photo I took : <h> MO : You had Yammer Day a few weeks ago . Can you tell us more about it ? <p> JM : We set up a Yammer HQ room in the office , where anyone could come and learn more about Yammer . We helped employees set up their accounts and even provided hands-on training on the spot . A lot of people did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to show them how much more value they would get out of Yammer if they had a clear profile photo . To make it easy for them , we helped users take photos for their profiles right there at Yammer Day . Of course , no Yammer Day is complete without cupcakes ! <h> MO : How are you maintaining interest after Yammer Day ? <p> JM : Education is a key part of maintaining engagement , and we help people set up groups and provide clarity around best practices , best topics and groups to use . To extend learning , we have a 101 group , where educational information is housed for easy access . We are also trying out a reverse mentoring program , where junior lawyers help senior partners become experts in social media . <h> MO : How do you use Yammer on a daily basis ? <p> JM &amp; CW : We use Yammer to share and find information across the organisation and help people to get to know each others expertise . Our Practice groups share news updates , and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Files and Pages to collaborate , and Yammers robust mobile apps allow us to communicate on the go . Lawyers are traditionally not interested in sharing they consider their knowledge their intellectual property but they are starting to open up to the idea . We need to embed sharing as an organisational value , and Yammer is going to help us get there . <h> MO : What is your usage policy like ? <p> JM : We have an easygoing policy : use common sense and the " New York Times front page test . " The New York Times front page test is basically a check-in you do with yourself prior to posting something digitally : " Would I want this to be on the front page of the New York Times ? " If the answer is " no , " you probably should hold off on posting it , or at least rephrase it . <h> MO : How does your CEO use Yammer ? <p> JM &amp; CW : Our CEO is really hands-on in the process ; he responds to conversations often and proactively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the one who spearheaded the Yammer effort he s one of the main instigators . <h> MO : What has Yammer helped you do since you launched it ? <p> JM : Yammer strengthened our culture tremendously . We are growing fast , and during a period of fast growth , its easy for things to get lost and for that cultural magic to get stale . Yammer has also helped us reduce our hierarchies and smash silos to create a more inclusive and transparent organisation . Its pretty remarkable when anyone in the organisation is able to speak directly to the CEO .

We 'd like to invite you to celebrate a Yammer champion each month ; someone who has really moved the needle in their organizations adoption of Yammer . In this inaugural issue , please meet Jonathan Anthony. - Jonathan- heads up Corporate Communications at Teekay Corporation , a $10b diversified marine energy company .

We do not have the resources to manage a complicated , centralised intranet so we wanted something standalone ( a single app that did it all , in the cloud ) , simple and scalable that required little or training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals of : personalization , sharing , collaboration and networking . We wanted a tool that flattened the organization and gave each user choice about the extent of their interactions with the network . Yammer does what it says on the tin. <p> The serendipity part is that by choosing ESN as intranet we probably moved ahead of the industry curve last year . We had some tough questioning internally about whether we had made the right decision . Fortunately we moved with the industry , not against it ; and with each iterative release of Yammer , we see the tools and functionality we wanted a year ago . Soon , our use of the ESN will probably be slightly behind the enterprise cutting edge curve , which is where a company like Teekay wants to be ! <p> This is a very recent post on the network and apropos to the social journey we have been on at Teekay over the last two years : <p> On our old intranet I began an anonymous blog called The Pundit covering the 2010 World Cup talking about the teams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some satirical barbs about the senior leaders in the organization . Lots of people liked it and lots of people didnt ( ! ) but it opened up a whole new way of communicating inside the company personality-led , first-person , relaxed , opinionated , direct , immediate , ( ir ) relevant . <p> Fast-forward two years and we have Yammer in place where everyone has the opportunity to express opinions , share ideas , commune , participate in the conversation . There are maybe 200 people 25% of our network participating in this one Euro2012 football poll and conversation . We are democratizing and flattening the organization one conversation at a time . <p> For a global company we have a presence in more than 20 countries , and in our Vancouver office alone we have over 30 nationalities finding ways to connect disparate groups is critical . <p> Of course , having the same level of engagement with a strategic conversation is our ESN holy grail . We want people to feel comfortable openly conversing about work topics in this , they tend to be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of using the network to crowdsource input and answers is a long-term project . But we are on that journey of discovery <p> Yammer flattens and opens up the organization ; it empowers users and says " *You* choose . " Consequently , as application owner , we have to give up control and embrace uncertainty . <p> For those in the network who do not appreciate *social* we say let us help you get more organized and simplify your experience. That brings more people on our side . But there is still a group who do not want to participate , and that 's OK . <p> We are trying to deliver an 80-20 solution . Aiming to get everyone proactive and positive is like trying to teach a pig to sing ; it wastes your time and it annoys the pig . <p> We are playing the long game with our ESN . My team must continually hold the space of possibility and opportunity ; and keep inviting users in to explore . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024668 @624668/ <h> The Cultural Imperative For A Social Business <p> By the Yammer team , on April 18 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Although effective collaboration has always been a cornerstone of a successful business , one could say that the unrelenting speed and sophistication of the social consumer web is making it more so . The changing dynamics of the marketplace expose broken processes and are forcing employees to work together better , in order to provide an unprecedented level of customized experience for customers . To be externally social , an organization must problem-solve , exchange information and collaborate across departmental lines . <p> How does one become social internally ? Just launch an internal social network like Yammer of course , and wait for magic to happen ? Not so fast ! No matter how intuitive a platform is to use , roll out or administer , this effort has to land on the fertile ground of the right culture . Culture is the hardest element of success , because its 1 ) hard to define , 2 ) takes a long time to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . With any kind of internal social networking , you are effectively changing behavior from everyone working inside a silo to a more open , transparent and collaborative environment . And as we all know , every time you attempt to change behavior , you run into resistance . The better you can anticipate resistance and channel it into positive energy , the higher the chances of success . <p> What is the " right " culture , and is there such a thing ? <p> While there is n't one right culture , just as culture is tough to compare across organizations , there are certain common elements of organizations that do well with these types of initiatives . Charlene Li sums it up best : " be open , be transparent , be authentic " . While this is easier said than done , and there are as many definitions to " authenticity " and " transparency " as there are people who define them , here are some key things : <p> Transparency and openness require the braveness of " opening up the kimono " , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting people know what 's happening and why , with advance notice , providing a channel to share feedback , and closing the feedback loop in the open . Companies that are truly transparent , are usually transparent inside and outside . When I was young and worked in very top-down organizations , announcements and organizational changes were delivered without sharing any reason and without a forum to ask questions / contribute ideas . This made me feel like I had no control of my life , and my opinion did n't  matter so I left - In an open culture , on the other hand , managers are and their subordinates feel like they are in the same boat , on the same team . This type of openness has to be vertical as well as lateral . <p> Knowledge hoarding is replaced by sharing . Traditionally , our educational systems have emphasized becoming a specialist . We have hoarded our knowledge in fear that if we shared what we knew , we will become more replaceable . In his bestseller " A Whole New Mind " , Daniel Pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological advances , have greatly affected what 's defendable as a competitive advantage . Rote memorization and textbook knowledge is no longer enough , especially since Internet has made knowledge more accessible . A true competitive advantage is the ability to learn , synthesize , share it back to the group and drive change . Check out this great video by Steven Johnson that describes what 's possible when functional silos come down . <p> Authenticity rules the day . Because internal and external social mindset expose inconsistencies between what you say and what you do if there are any you really need to examine your value system as an organization and establish processes to ensure that everything you do is consistent with this value system . Does your value system support your mission ? Do you know what your mission is ? If you define and commit to these values as an organization , decisions will actually become easier , as you ask yourself each time " is this consistent with our values ? " Of course , every employee has to be empowered to act to support these values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of Zappos , - that 's exactly what makes them successful : every action they take maps back to their mission of providing unparalleled service for their customers . <p> Organization is flat . Finally , as a result of the above points , a new type of flat and collaborative organization starts to emerge . Senior management engages in a dialogue with employees . Middle management gets out of the way and enables team cohesiveness instead of mandating actions . Employees are able to communicate and collaborate across silos . <p> What are the barriers to this kind of culture ? <p> The above sounds great , does n't  it ? Is this achievable , or is it a Utopian rhetoric ? Why are n't  more companies like that in real life ? I 'd say that many are trying , but it takes a lot to get 100% there . There are some serious barriers to this type of culture , some of which are : <p> Command and control mindset : Traditionally , corporations have been structured with tightly managed controls at the top , which were passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who actually performed the work . Tasks to be done , as well as the processes by which these tasks had to be done , were mandated from the top . This is starting to change drastically , as teams are now acting as fluid organisms vs. machines . Check out this fantastic post by Dave Grey on this matter . <p> Functional silos : Perpetuated by functional isolation and years of specialization , many organizations ended up with functional silos . Of course , departments still need to exist in order to divide up the work and avoid a " free for all " situation . After all , marketing should be marketing , sales should be selling , the product team should be defining the product and engineers should be building it . However , all these groups do n't  exist in a vacuum ; the decisions that each group makes affect all other groups . Thus , cross-functional collaboration is absolutely key to exchanging ideas , doing a better job , making better decisions and avoiding work duplication . <p> Rigid hierarchies : Scarcity of information pre-Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At times , this asymmetry of information , and not the right leadership skills , allowed people to rise up the corporate ladder . Hierarchies were developed to preserve this status quo . However , things are changing rapidly , and democratization of information is definitely putting the emphasis back on leadership style , and not access to information , as a competitive advantage . <p> Wrong things are measured : Theres a saying : " what gets measured , gets done . " No matter how grand your vision and strategy are , if people are n't  incentivized to take certain steps , their behavior is n't going to change . Focus on short-term results is understandable , as Wall Street puts a lot of pressure on organizations to perform in the short-term . However , we need to make sure we are also incentivizing behaviors that will help us succeed in the long-term , and measuring their effect . <p> What do you think ? What have been some barriers to a more open culture that you have come across ? How did you get over these barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with steps you can take to improve your culture .

Its about doing what we do in a visible way to our colleagues . Its a generous way of working and we get back what we put in . <p> Not working out loud means we work in private at the pace we want , but we may miss out on important information . Other people can not become engaged in what were working on and may feel like were doing things to them rather than with them . Working in isolation , giving others no visibility could also lead to duplicated effort because people do n't  know what 's being worked on . <h> What are the benefits of working out loud ? <h> Working out loud helps us make better decisions <p> Other people may have knowledge , experience and perspectives that could improve the quality of our decisions . We do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that we may not even know exist can see what were working on and offer input to help us make better decisions based on information from people closer to the action . If an organisations Product Development team works in an open way , specifications can be enriched by the insight gained from people in the Customer Support team who interact directly with customers . <h> Working out loud helps increase engagement <p> We cant make people engaged . Engagement is an outcome . People become engaged naturally when they have the opportunity to get involved and take ownership . Working out loud makes it easier for people to get involved . <h> Working out loud helps organisations be more adaptable <p> If all decisions have to go through the top of an organisation ( Senior Leadership or Managers ) , it can take time to receive responses and begin acting on the new information . Organisations constantly need to respond to changes markets , competitors , customer needs and internal . Working out loud means everyone , throughout the organisation , can immediately access the information and expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have more insight into the decisions that are being made , the organisation can be more aligned to strategic objectives . <h> Busting some myths <p> While helping organisations on the journey from working in private to working out loud , here are some of the myths we 've encountered . <h> Myth : Too many people will get involved and it will slow me down <p> If we work out loud , then yes , its more likely that people will get involved if they are motivated . That 's the point , these contributors care about the organisation and want to help create the best work . Set expectations up front about the timeline of the project and who owns what decisions . This way , you still welcome feedback and you are also clear about roles and responsibilities . <h> Myth : My work is n't relevant to others <p> Many people are n't  open to sharing their work publicly because they do n't  think its relevant to others . The reality is we are n't  actually in the best position to determine if our work is relevant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluate this . You never know who on another side of the organisation could benefit from the work you are doing , so before you post something in private , think about whether the benefits of it being in private outweigh the benefits of it being in public . <h> Myth : I do n't  want to create more noise for other people <p> Previously in organisations , the recipient had very little control over what information was sent to them . For example , with email the sender chooses who to send email to , and the recipient has to click through , open and read each email . <p> Social networking brings a shift in the way that communication flows . Messages can be posted in public , and the power is shifting to the receiver . Individuals have more choice . They can follow the things they find interesting and scan through a stream of relevant messages rather than open each one individually . <h> Myth : I 've been hired to do this job , other people should only do their own job <p> People have many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , you can attract people with knowledge that you did n't  know about to help add value to what you 're working on . <h> Tips to help make the shift to working out loud <p> Make working out loud the default : Think about what you 're currently working on . Does it really need to be private ? Ask : " would the benefits of working in public be greater than if I worked in private ? " <p> Be confident : People will see your work . This might feel uncomfortable at first . The quality of your work could be improved by their input and advice . <p> Encourage an open culture : Will people be motivated to share ? Changing culture can take a long time , though small incremental changes can make a big difference . Begin by helping our Leaders ( those that set the tone ) see the benefits of working out loud , and encourage them to role-model the behavior they want to inspire in others . <h> How would you help people feel more comfortable working out loud ? @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024673 @624673/ <h> Social Media vs . Email Are We Asking The Right Questions ? <p> By the Yammer team , on January 27 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> While announcing the death of e-mail is a bit premature , its absolutely a reality that the paradigm of communication has changed . There has been a flurry of articles lately about giving up email completely , as well as criticisms of such an approach . I think what 's more valuable than claiming the victory of each of the extremes is the discussion of use cases around each medium and improving our collective etiquette around multi-channel conversations . After all , the devil is in the details . <p> As I alluded to in my comment in the following- article in ReadWriteWeb , social networks ( internal and private external like Yammer or public external like Twitter and Facebook ) are in a position to significantly reduce email load . Capgemini reported a 40% decrease in email volume as a result of Yammer , and there are countless others that have similar results . There are certain efficiencies that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . There is also the serendipity of discovering information and getting responses from people you would never think to email . Communication is not a solitary activity , regardless of channel , and things need to be considered from the point of view of the poster ( how things are communicated ) and the reader ( how things are received ) . Here are some questions that you should ask yourself to inform your decision - and corresponding recommendations that can help navigate the complex world of interpersonal communication . <p> Is your message task oriented ? What is your message about ? If you want one or a few people to take action on something , and no one else can benefit from knowing it , its better suited for email or a private message on Yammer . If you want people at your company to be aware of it , post it to your social network . Our customers refer to the knowledge received by scrolling through their social network on their own terms as " ambient awareness " . You do n't  need to know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if you miss it ! ) , but its immensely helpful to make you a well-informed cross-functional collaborator that you are. - Email is the most disruptive of the asynchronous methods of communication we 've been conditioned ( perhaps self-inflicted ) to respond to emails , and do so in kind . <p> Who is the audience ? Just as important as knowing the message is knowing your audience . Is this audience on the same network ? If your message is narrow and you are communicating with multiple collaborators on your team , post it to your team group on Yammer . If you want others to see it for true cross-functional magic , post it for everyone to see and make sure to highlight ( via @ mentioning ) the right people . Rule of thumb : if you find yourself cc:ing more than just a few people , its probably time to take it to your companys social network . The rise in abuse of email as the " cover your you-know-what " has resulted in out-of-control cc:s , which have collectively desensitized us to the medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may not know where to direct your post . In that case , you definitely want to use your social network to activate that serendipity . If your message has merit , your coworkers will uplift it and spread it , pulling in their expertise and expertise of others . Sometimes you know who should get it , sometimes you want people to discover it , and sometimes a little bit of both . When consuming information , we sometimes- do n't  quite know what we are looking for and where to find it this kind of serendipity can lead to unexpected outcomes . <p> Do you want people to find it and iterate on it later ? A key benefit of an enterprise social network like Yammer is knowledge management . In addition to uncovering things that are temporally relevant , a system like Yammer helps you retain knowledge long after the employee has left the company . In addition to asking yourself if others can benefit from this information , think about longevity of this content and how likely someone will be to reuse it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will want to make sure you are using the right syntax ( tags and topics ) , as well as putting it in the right groups , to help with archival . <p> Is it public or private ? Just as critical in your decision is going to be the privacy of the message . Is this something meant for the eyes of very few people , or can it be shared broadly . Although we are staunch advocates of transparency and openness , there are some use cases where things need to be handled privately and " in the backchannel . " If you are sharing confidential information that someone entrusted you with ( a confidential customer record ) , please treat it with care . Even if the channel is private , refrain from " talking smack " about other people you never know when someone else may add them to the conversation . <p> Hopefully this list of questions albeit a non-exhaustive one wil help you navigate the - complex world of digital communications . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

Todays employees are hyper-connected and have access to resources and information via social media . How do you engage them at work ? How are you attracting and retaining your best talent ? - Are you developing them by giving them the tools to be successful ? An excerpt from this Gallop report your workers may not be as engaged as you think <p> " Seventy-one percent of American workers are " not engaged " or " actively disengaged " in their work , meaning they are emotionally disconnected from their workplaces and are less likely to be productive .

Training can be part of onboarding or continuing professional education ; whatever the training class is , you need to find the answer to these questions . <p> One great way to boost engagement and keep it elevated is through training activities . Within your established programs you might already have pre and post training activities . For example , you might send an email including a case study and pre-work that must be completed before your new sales team enters the session . - A few years ago , I was in a Time Management class and the trainer sent a worksheet for us to record everything we did for our workday leading up to the class .

@@12024684 @624684/ <h> Building the Business Case for Your Social Business Strategy <p> By the Yammer team , on May 1 , 2014May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> As I shared in the first post of this blog series , having a clear goal and plan for how your enterprise social network ( ESN ) and social business ties back to your overall business is the foundation of your strategy . In this post , well go through three steps that you 'll need to take to build your strategy . <p> Step 1 : Define Your Vision and Goals <p> At Altimeter , we define a social business strategy as " The deep integration of social technology and social methodologies into the organization to drive business impact . " As high level vision statement of what you hope to accomplish with your efforts is a great place to start . Maybe its becoming a more operationally efficient organization , or reducing risk . Maybe its giving your internal customers a better experience . <p> Yammer created a short list of business goals that it built into its " Working Social " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hopefully spark some ideas : <p> While its tempting to check all of these goals , I suggest that you start with only a few Yammers interactive tool will only let you choose two to begin . The logic : you need to prioritize . After all , strategy is what you will do and just as importantly , what you will not do . <p> Step 2 : Map Your Goals Back to Business Strategy <p> Once you have a small handful of social business goals , the next step is to map each back to your business goals . here 's a hypothetical example : Let 's say that my organization has three major strategic goals : 1 ) Drive Efficiency , 2 ) Manage Risk and 3 ) Improve Internal Customer Experience . In addition , I also have identified three Social Business Objectives : 1 ) Finding expertise from all over the organization , 2 ) Build a unified culture and 3 ) Get products to market faster . <p> Then here 's the simple but powerful step create a chart that shows how these two sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not every social business goal maps back to every business priority its important not to force connections when they are n't  there . <p> Example : Mapping Social Business Goals to Overall Business Priorities <p> In the last blog post of this series , well return back to this chart and look at how you would actually measure progress toward these goals . But in the meantime , support your business case for your social business initiatives by bringing in case studies and data , especially those provided by companies like Yammer . So when leadership asks the inevitable " What 's in it for me ? " question , you 'll be armed right thought starters and evidence on how an ESN can benefit your business . <p> Step 3 : Create a Strategy Roadmap <p> The last step of your strategic plan is to create a roadmap what will you tackle first , second , third ? The roadmap will also be a forcing function to prioritize what you will do because you simply cant do everything all within the first six months of your deployment , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business Strategy Roadmap <p> Note that this roadmap goes out for three years in six month increments . This is intentional and it makes you think for the long term about the impact that your initiatives will have on the organization . Granted , your plans three years out will be far less detailed than for the first six months , but the benefit is that it maps back to your original vision and goals ( see first step above ) of the impact on the business . <p> At this point , you should have your top-line goals mapped back to business goals , and a roadmap that shows how you are going to achieve them . Now the next step is to ensure that key people in your organization buy into your strategy which is the subject of the third post in this blog series . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024689 @624689/ <h> Getting Engagement Out Of Mass Communications <p> By the Yammer team , on April 8 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> This post was contributed by Vip Patel , Senior Customer Success Manager at Yammer <p> What would you say if you no longer received those lengthy company-wide , mass communication emails ? Would you move along and carry on with your day , or would you actually miss them ? here 's how I would answer these questions : 1 ) I know I would not miss them , even if the emails existed , and 2 ) My day would continue to go on as the emails are not interactive and do n't  really need my input . Company-wide emails for mass communication are n't  new ; theyve existed since e- mail first came into being decades ago . Although news or updates about the company and organizational changes are frequently communicated this way , more often that not , these emails are rarely read or responded to . <p> Most of our customers use Yammer to connect their globally dispersed workforces , to help share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can practically use Yammer for anything from connecting with your team on a project , to communicating across the whole department and even across departments . One of my favorite use cases is replacement of those lengthy , one-way , and often boring , and unattractive company-wide email blasts . We all know these emails . Their end goal is to spread news and inspire engagement with your readers . The truth is , email does not generally provide that level of engagement , and here are some reasons why : <p> E-mail is often one-way and is not interactive . <p> Most employees do not respond to these one-way emails . <p> There 's no way to see which of your employees are collectively engaging or responding to these emails . <p> Sender of email sees very little input or acceptance from readers . <p> With a tool like Yammer , you have a much greater chance of actually getting your employees to read and participate in company-wide communications it can be a rather transformative experience . For example , an Enterprise Yammer customer ( a large hospital system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its organization to replace lengthy email chains in favor of Yammer . They encourage the usage of enterprise social networking to increase collaboration amongst employees and to help reduce unnecessary email overload . Their CIO uses it instead of sending email , and his daily usage has helped him significantly reduce his email inbox . <p> As you can see from this customer example , by moving at least some of your company-wide , departmental communications into Yammer , you will start to create a sense of interactivity and engagement with received updates . Imagine the following use case : a company-wide Yammer update around a recent merger . Not only will your employees read the post , but engage in it via several actions , such as commenting , liking and bookmarking . This can prove to be extremely valuable as feedback to you , the creator of the message : you will see people commenting and liking your post , creating a sense of interaction . <p> Where is all this change coming from and why ? Social networking has over the recent years , surpassed email usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put together a detailed presentation on Communications and the recent shift of social networking over email . In her presentation , she states how social networking has surpassed e-mail , which is illustrated by the chart below : <p> Over the past few years , social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have surpassed e-mail usage . This shift is now slowly becoming a reality and is now making its way into the Enterprise . Your employees , most of whom are familiar with Facebook , are also likely to understand tools like Yammer , fostering engagement . However , its important to note that while behaviors do n't  need to change , use cases and objectives for participation in an Enterprise social network are quite different from those in a purely social one . <p> Here are 3 tips that can help you get started with reducing those company -wide email blasts and moving over to Yammer : <p> Start small . Do n't  move everything to Yammer immediately . Identify one area , for example HR , that would want to give Yammer a go . Create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending your departmental updates there . Ensure employees of the specific department join this group . <p> Get executive buy-in . Once you have identified a specific department you would like to test Yammer on , a good next step is to have an Executive from the department sponsor the project . Executives are key in this scenario , as they can really help drive the change that would be needed . The Executive should be the one responsible for sending out the updates . <p> Set an example ! If this ends up being successful , encourage other departments to adopt it ; you should spend some time , sharing best practices . The point is if you lead by example , you will encourage Yammer usage and increase adoption at your organization . What better way than to get other departments excited ? <p> I hope you found this post useful ! Have you been able to shift some of your email communication to a more interactive channel ?

@@12024690 @624690/ <h> How TfL Used Yammer During London 2012 Olympics <p> By the Yammer team , on October 11 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Transport for London ( TfL ) is the local government body responsible for the transport network across Greater London in the United Kingdom . - Three thousand TfL employees volunteered to be Travel Ambassadors throughout the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to support the unprecedented numbers of customers using the London transport network. - Travel Ambassadors ( TAs ) were stationed at underground , rail , bus and boat stations throughout the city and were identifiable by their bright pink jackets . <p> The Travel Ambassadors Yammer Network <p> TfL provided a dedicated Yammer network for the TAs , which launched on 25th July . This network provided a forum for all TAs to communicate with one another to support their service to the public . TAs were able to access Yammer on their iPad or iPhone while on their shifts , and also by web browser when in the office . <p> Within three days of the network launch , 1,254 users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been posted , illustrating that the platform was already providing value at an early stage . <p> How Travel Ambassadors Used Yammer <p> On their Yammer network volunteers let each other know which locations were busy so coordinators could redeploy them quickly . TAs gave each other tips on what to expect while volunteering , reassuring those on their first shift . They advised one another on how to use their iPads and how to get the most out of the apps available to them ( for example , Twitter , Yammer , etc ) . <p> TAs boosted team morale by expressing what a positive experience they were having ( even when it was raining ) . They shared comments theyd received from members of the public , which sometimes included the enviable feedback you have saved my life and even you have saved my life again . <p> A #celebrityspot hashtag encouraged staff to share photos theyd taken of celebrities from their device . The TA who managed to get a snap of Boris Johnson obviously got a lot of feedback on the network ! They also set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included here was a picture of volunteers lined up assuming Usain Bolts now-iconic posein order to direct passengers from Stratford Station to the Olympic Park . <p> Staff coordinating the volunteers also made use of and benefitted from the Yammer network . Toward the end of the first week of the Games , TAs were requested to do shifts within the Olympic Park itself over that weekend . Coordinators used Yammer to arrange the shifts for 400 volunteers in less than 24 hours . <p> The positive outcomes of the Travel Ambassador project were numerous for the public , the Olympic and Paralympic Games and TfL staff . <p> Yammer not only provided the platform to support the delivery of this project but the medium through which feedback from staff could be collected and shared . <p> The efforts of the project management team were crucial in ensuring that the use of Yammer and mobile devices was well supported . This team analysed the conversations happening in the network to contribute to operational decisions and to realize and accurately convey the impact the project had on the entire organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Travel Ambassador project contributed to a growing spirit of collaboration across TfLs organizational modes . Volunteers from different roles and modes worked together for the first time , and many staff expressed a greater appreciation of the operational roles that their colleagues carry out on a daily basis . <p> Virtual connections also arose : they started as simple questions and answers later developing into stronger conversations based on insight , thoughtfulness , support and respect . These ongoing relationships are expected to contribute to a more connected culture across the organization . <p> Influencing operational decision-making <p> Following the Olympic and Paralympic Games , TAs took to Yammer to make the case for having TAs to support similarly large events in London in future . As a result , senior staff took the decision to rollout TAs for Londons Notting Hill Carnival over the August Bank Holiday weekend . <p> Employee engagement <p> Significantly , employees that volunteered for this role felt valued and appreciated , notably from the positive feedback they received from the public ( both in person and via the press and social media ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TfL who had taken the time to visit them on their shifts . <p> What 's happening on the ground ? <p> Clearly , volunteers benefitted from getting questions and answers to and from one another to support the public . An additional benefit , however , was to empower these employees and , ultimately , to make them self-sufficient , reducing the burden on coordination staff . <p> The legacy <p> Many in London ( and beyond ) are sad that the Olympic and Paralympic Games have come to an end . There was a conciliatory , helpful and happy atmosphere across the city during that period , largely thanks to the work of the volunteers ( and the British gold medalists ! ) . The Travel Ambassadors Yammer network similarly took on that tone of collaboration and positivity , facilitating the fantastic service the TAs delivered and positively influencing the longer-term operational and cultural direction of TfL. @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024691 @624691/ <h> Realizing Measurable Value with Your Yammer Network <p> By the Yammer team , on February 6 , 2015June 28 , 2017 0Shares <p> Joe Stumpf at Microsoft Office 365 Customer Success is the co-author . <p> Realizing measurable business value from technology requires considerably more than simply deploying a piece of software , a system or even a platform : it requires a commitment to driving adoption of these capabilities throughout your organization . IT departments around the world have been dancing around the issue of adoption by focusing efforts on things like user experience in the hopes that if they make a tool easier to use , their business users will do just that . Unfortunately , that model reminiscent of the plot of the movie " Field of Dreams " usually fails to produce the dramatic results that the C-suite is seeking . The reason for this failure is simple : driving adoption is a multi-faceted journey that requires transformation of the way in which people get work done . Sounds pretty difficult , right ? Do n't  despair its a lot more achievable than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft uses to describe the methodology of realizing value from its enterprise social platform ) at ManyWorlds began 4.5 years ago when Yammer was still in its infancy and yet demonstrated its power to change how work is done and how information flows in the organization . That was the beginning of the " connected age " , a time when access to information is basically instant and ubiquitous . Today , our world and your organization are part of a giant network where everyone has access to anyone and everything . There are almost no barriers to publishing or consuming information at any scale . This has created tremendous opportunities for some , but has also created tremendous challenges for companies that still believe that they can make a plan today based on the information they have , and simply execute on that plan . <p> We know now that that 's not working : industries and markets are changing too quickly for us to focus solely on the ways that have worked in the past . As a longtime Microsoft Partner whose tools and techniques have helped tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience is in embedding social into business processes to help organizations such as yours transform themselves and achieve measurable business value through technology such as Office 365 . <p> You can find great information about the social journey , including best practices and templates in the Office 365 Success Center . The social journey is a big topic and we encourage you to dive deeply into the Office 365 Success Center materials . In order to help you along the way , we want to focus on a few key elements we 've found to be critical for our customers success and will be important for you to address early in your own social journey . <p> Drive Executive Engagement and Sponsorship <p> One of the most critical elements of any social journey is getting your executives on board visibly . Fundamentally , the social journey is about cultural change within your organization and your executives have the greatest influence on your culture . If they do n't  participate and support your social journey visibly then you can not realistically expect your employees to transform the way in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives is unlike any technology-related project in which they may have participated in the past . They need to walk the talk . At the same time , we know that executive engagement is often a challenge in organizations . <p> Over the years , we have found that C-Suite executives have been much more engaged when they have a tablet on their desk that allows them to consume and participate in ways that accommodate their hectic schedules and frantic lifestyles , such as streaming a CNN-like touch experience . In order to drive better executive engagement , we developed a Yammer app called Streaming It Out Loud , which allows executives to quickly see the heartbeat of the organization , as well as feel connected to what is top of mind for their employees . And of course its easy to have the stream set up on the tablet so that they can Like a post directly from the touch screen , comment on a conversation or praise one of their employee even when traveling which creates very effective engagement for the rest of the organization . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ABCs of executive engagement in the social journey : <p> Active and visible participation <p> Building a coalition with their executive peers <p> Communicating directly with employees <p> This type of executive engagement is critical when you are trying to drive cultural change and its also very easy to achieve with a bit of forethought and the right tools . <p> Stimulate Yammer Adoption &amp; Engagement <p> Another key to driving cultural change in your organization as part of your social journey is engage as big and broad an audience as possible to generate momentum for the change . Every person in your organization can be classified as either a green dot , yellow dot or red dot . Green dots are people who fundamentally " get it " and embrace the change you are trying to drive . Yellow dots are on the fence , but can be flipped to green dots with a bit of effort . Unfortunately , you also have red dots , which are those people who actively or passively oppose the change you are advocating . Forget about your red dots they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reaching the yellow dots and reinforcing your green dots , often the difference can be the amount of contact they have with the richness of the content and the ubiquity of Yammer . Reaching a wider audience at your organization and providing that exposure that just may flip a good number of your yellow dots to green . <p> One way to create that higher level of exposure is to share Yammer streams during events and YamJams . We also know that doing so in a format that is familiar to your employees is an important determinant of acceptance , which is why Streaming It Out Loud has several features that allow organizations to make it their own . You can choose the layout of the stream , and also have the ability to customize the logo , header and background colors and to add a filter for a group , topic or individual . Its easy to then Share these Settings with your users , and have all the customizations automatically apply for each user . Users can Like , Reply and Post directly from the responsively designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making it easy and comfortable for your yellow dots to " lurk " , discover and ultimately participate actively in your social platform is an absolute requirement to grow your community of green dots . <p> ( Streaming It Out Loud being used at the Yammer Working Social Tour live event series ) <p> Accommodate Your Employees Schedules <p> We all know that employees not only have responsibilities to the organization , but they also have family and social commitments that can prevent them from participating or consuming information in the exact manner you might envision . In addition , most large organizations have a growing number of remote employees that are spread across the globe . These complications keep your internal communications people up at night trying to figure out how best to communicate with these employees and ensure that they also feel connected . Similar to recording an event for viewing at a later date , we created , in essence , a DVR for Yammer , called Replay , which allows your employees to replay posts while using Streaming It Out Loud , adding a post every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on demand . <p> ( Replaying a YamJam on the Microsoft Office 365 Yammer Network ) <p> We have found that this approach is more engaging for employees and can help you reach people who missed events or YamJams because of timezones , geographies or other commitments . This is a great way to allow your deskless workers to engage during downtimes . You can also create tailored replays to showcase #yamwins ( or other hashtagged content ) within your network to showcase all the great stories captured in your social platform or other content you want to ensure reaches your employees . Serving up content to your employees in ways that fit their schedule is very important in increasing the reach and exposure of your Yammer network and will result in more yellow dots being converted to green . <p> Solve Specific Problems for Your Employees <p> Another important strategy for realizing measurable value from your Yammer network is to solve specific issues that your employees confront on a daily basis . This seems like a self-evident idea , but organizations typically try to solve their own issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employees , however , usually have their own , personal , issues that are distinct from the broader organizational issues . For instance , identifying expertise sounds like a concern shared by the organization and its employees . At an organizational level , talent management is always a hot topic , both in terms of the pipeline of people and understanding the range , depth and combination of competencies of individuals . At a personal level , employees are always trying to find expertise within an organization in order to simply do their daily job . Traditionally , we have relied upon people finders and profile information , which is often static and out of date , to identify expertise within our organizations . These solutions really do not address either level no wonder this continues to be such a problem . <p> Having an enterprise social platform generates an invaluable amount of qualitative data and conversations that can help us identify and engage the real expertise within the organization . Tapping into that treasure trove , however , can be a daunting task . ManyWorlds has helped organizations do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patented technology to graph and inference expertise in your organization based on the actual contributions of staff in Yammer and SharePoint , not the often static and out of date profile information . A great complement to existing people finder solutions , With Synxi , you can visualize recommended subject matter experts , even within the context of a specific Yammer post with detailed combinations of expertise , as well as understanding expertise patterns over time in the organization . This allows you to discover individuals whose work may be lost otherwise due to lack of managerial attention or **25;2191;TOOLONG boundaries as well as business scenarios such as internal reorganization or post-merger or acquisition activity . This solution can help solve an important issue for your employees , which is another key to driving adoption . <p> Synxi shows inferred relative expertise in the context of a specific Yammer post <p> Summary <p> Realizing measurable value from your enterprise social tools , such as SharePoint Online and Yammer , is a critical challenge facing all organizations today . Deployment is not enough you must embrace the new currency of adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to do so , you must fundamentally change the culture of your organization engage your executives in new and meaningful ways , reach a broad audience of green and yellow dots , make it easy for your employees to participate on their schedule and help employees solve their challenges .

Or here 's another situation : you work so hard on the project , but no one knows what you are doing . As a result , you do n't  get the recognition you deserve , and you find out that someone else is working on a similar project in a different department . Personally , I 've been in both situations several times . <p> According to the Harris Interactive survey ( disclosure , this study was sponsored by Yammer ) , companies still have a long way to go in improving internal communications and collaboration . The survey took a look at 1,168 adults who are not the only person who works at their company/organization , and showed that communication bottlenecks impact productivity , as well as morale . Here are some of the major findings : <p> Ineffective internal communications limit productivity : <p> 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective , while only 8% said they are effective ; <p> 34% said that communication bottlenecks impact their productivity ; <p> 30% said they do n't  have the necessary information to do their jobs ; <p> 22% said that long ineffective meetings negatively impact their productivity . <p> Ineffective internal communications negatively impact employee morale : 19% feel that their organizations are not effective at recognizing and rewarding highly productive , collaborative and contributing employees ; By comparison , only 8% feel that their company was effective <p> Interacting with colleagues is preferred to interacting with senior managers ( 60% vs. 35% ) , and impersonal communication like email ( 74% ) and phone ( 61% ) are much preferred to scheduled in-person meetings ( 31% ) . Most do not feel comfortable sharing ideas and feedback with managers and executives . - Its also very interesting to note that 52% of respondents respect coworkers , while only 39% respect their managers ; 29% learn from coworkers , while 19% learn from managers . <p> Ineffective internal communication results in siloed communications and stymied innovation . How can people work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that only 7% of respondents feel that their coworkers know the range of their skills , and 32% of men vs. 24% of women think their colleagues know and understand their unique skills very well ? <p> So where do we go from here ? At Yammer , we deeply believe in opening up communication to boost morale and reduce productivity bottlenecks described above . - Furthermore , creating the culture in which open communication thrives , can foster better dialogue between employees and managers , while also helping everyone get to know other peoples skills . At the heart of improving every internal communication process improvement are three major steps : culture , process , tools . <p> If you do n't  have the right organizational culture in place , you can spend a considerable amount of resources on designing programs and investing in collaboration tools , with meager results .

@@12024700 @624700/ <p> The main takeaway of the session is very simply that going to market with a B2B product is radically different today than it was even a couple of years ago . Here are some of the ways in which things have changed : <p> 1 ) - - Companies sell directly to customers : The advent of the Internet has allowed businesses to interact with their customers directly on the Internet . Whether or not the web becomes the ultimate purchasing channel , prospects go to the web to get information they need . Before and after purchase , customers go to the web to get education , best practices , tips and tricks . The social web has brought even more information to the customers fingertips from a variety of sources : peers , industry experts , and the company itself . <p> 2 ) - - Build virality into the product : As a result of consumerization of business applications , the behavior of business users mimics that of consumer users . This new breed of users wants to invite others into a product that 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to creating a killer product , you need to build virality into the product to make sharing and inviting easier . <p> 3 ) - - Freemium model : If your business model is a freemium model , your whole sales cycle can essentially be the process of moving some free users to premium users . Freemium gives you two audiences , Aaron Levie noted : 1 ) IT has a budget , 2 ) user has no budget , but needs his / her pain-point solved . <p> 4 ) - - Selling to the user : Due to ease of sign-up , users no longer want to buy off the demo , they want the product to be usable without heavy customization and modification . During the panel , David Sacks shared the Yammer sales process we do n't  buy leads and do n't  cold call ; rather , we simply let people sign up , foster adoption across the company and grow grow the network . User experience means everything to this sales cycle .. <p> 5 ) - - Selling to the buyer : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise buyer , because adoption and utility can be proved first , without a heavy investment of time and money . However , you need to be careful to not wait too long to get IT into the conversation ; this may jeopardize enterprise-wide adoption . Rather , you need to form a partnership from the very beginning , helping address issues of security , data privacy and deployment . <p> 6 ) - - Learning from the traditional model : During the panel , Aaron Levie highlighted that although we spend a lot of resources on optimizing signup flow and conversion , we still have a lot to learn from the traditional business models . Sometimes its simply more efficient for the organization to deploy a product company-wide . At Yammer , we have created a whole job function called Customer Success Manager ( CSM ) , which centers around successful usages and rollout of customer networks . <p> 7 ) - - Customer feedback loop informs the product : One of the advantages of being within arms reach to the customer is the ability to make better product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the sales process , informs the product roadmap . <p> 8 ) - - Importance of being enterprise ready : One important piece of the success puzzle is being enterprise ready . Being an innovative technology is not enough ; its important to inspire respect and signal availability of resources and longevity . On the panel , Christine Herron told a story of a startup that had a hard time shedding its startup image and being taken seriously by enterprise clients . A consultative enterprise sales team is necessary to inspire that confidence . Sacks shared that when Yammer first started , we were na+ve in thinking that the buying process was as simple as pulling out a credit card . As we got adoption in large companies , we realized that we needed to have conversations with IT about issues of security , legal and - ROI . <p> 9 ) - - Platform integration : Companies adopt many software platforms over the course of their lives , in which content and workflows may reside . Thus , interoperability and integration has become a de-facto standard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an example , two of the panelists companies Box.net and Yammer work together to allow customers to bring their Box.net documents to their Yammer workflow .

If you are a user , how have your usage patterns changed ? If you are an admin , what types of things are you expecting from vendors ?

@@12024703 @624703/ <h> Working Social : Onboarding <p> By the Yammer team , on August 28 , 2013May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> This is the first in a series of posts on the topic of " working social . " Future articles in this series will illustrate how to use Yammer to work on projects , operate cross functionally , and work with our external customers . <p> About a year and a half ago , I started working at Yammer as a Customer Success Manager . What initially intrigued me about Yammer was n't just the intuitive user interface and the rich menu of features , but also how it transformed the onboarding process into a more seamless transition into the company . <p> The Traditional Approach to Onboarding <p> Let 's take a look at how some companies without the power of Yammer onboard their employees . A traditional first day for an employee involves another team member jumping through hoops so that the new hire has access to the appropriate distribution lists . After a few days , the new hire would start to receive the emails being exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know about any of the projects that were going on , someonelikely multiple peoplewould have to sit down with me and bring me up to speed . <p> After that , I 'll probably get bombarded with a barrage of emails forwarded to me in an effort to catch me up on everything . Though , therein lies a problem , forwarded emails breaks threads and I have to get out a secret decoder ring in order to piece all the information together . This takes time that I could otherwise be using to be more productive on the project . <p> Adding to the confusion , the person who is putting me on all these distribution lists is the one making an assumption that all these lists are even relevant to me . <p> Does this scenario sound familiar ? <p> The Yammer Approach to Onboarding <p> Now , let 's look at the flipside of the onboarding process with my experience joining- - Yammer . Instead of being added to distribution lists , I was immediately given access to the Yammer network where I was able to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my personal interests . <p> Instead of having no say about what distribution lists I 'm added to , I 'm able to join a group specific to my job and personal interests . All the conversations and activity about that account are captured in the Yammer Group . As a result , I was able to glance through the previous dialogue and access any relevant notes and files , which brought me up to speed in a matter of hours . <p> As a new employee , I felt more engaged because I was able to make choices about the information I was seeing . The fact that information was accessible , versus being partitioned off , showed me that Yammer had imparted a level of trust in its employees to share information in order for us to be more productive . <p> Next Steps <p> At Yammer , all employeesno matter the senioritywork in a very open-manner , both physically and virtually . Were able to do so as a result of the tools were provided and , more importantly , because our culture expects it . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps you can take to get your company moving in the right direction : <p> Instead of using distribution lists , have those account and project teams use the Yammer group for all related communications . You could even remove the temptation of using the distribution list by removing it from your email directory altogether . <p> When new employees join the company , or new team members join a project , invite them to the group . Direct them to pertinent conversations and files . <p> I think you 'll find that by taking steps towards getting teams working in Yammer groups , your ability to on board new employees and team members becomes much more seamless and engaging . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024709 @624709/ <h> Borrowing A Page From City Planning <p> By the Yammer team , on March 29 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> This post was contributed by Maria Ogneva , the Head of Community at Yammer . <p> I attended the Dachis Group Business Summit a couple of weeks ago , and one of the sessions that impacted me the most was Dave Grays " The Connected Business " . Grays talk was a riff off his blogpost by the same name , which positions a modern company as a complex , living organism that no longer fits into the paradigm of a machine . Gray posits that a company has always operated as a machine , which has to be controlled , maintained and fixed . A machine is rigid in the way it operates ; it works the same way all day every day until it breaks . This is indeed reminiscent of how many organizations have set up their structures and processes -too rigid and disconnected to be relevant in todays fast-changing and fluid world . The demands of a modern business are challenging this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service on their terms , a generation of knowledge workers are yearning to solve custom problems vs. being a cog in a wheel , and competition is fiercer than ever . <p> Inspired by discussions with Thomas Vander Wal , Gray draws an insightful parallel between the complexity of todays organization and the human organism , and the ultimate system of human organisms a city . Cities are complex systems , which can grow and support their own growth organically . Gray takes the following lessons from city design and adapts them to the enterprise . Below I 'm riffing off his ideas , adapting them to use cases for internal social networks , and adding my own ideas . <p> 1 ) Importance of culture : A " connected company " the term that Gray uses throughout this blog is first and foremost a complex patchwork of humans . As much as each person has a unique voice , they are all united by a common culture . However , many companies are missing a unified and a strongly-pronounced culture . I think this is caused by several things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite simply lack of investment . Yes , it takes work and effort to develop and cultivate a culture . <p> 2 ) Pilot programs : Gray says that the best communities inside of cities are the ones that are tightly ( but not too densely ) populated with people . Ultimately , humans want to belong and be part of something bigger than they are . In a system like Yammer , this can be achieved rather naturally , as a result of virality . Communities start with a few people and spread to other parts of the organization ; - they have to start somewhere and be artfully seeded with users who can unlock and communicate their meaning . <p> I 'd also take it a step further and say that for a community to be truly successful , tightly-knit and functional , it has to come close to being able to sustain itself . For example , a neighborhood should have a food shop , a bakery , a post office , a clothing store , a dry-cleaners , public transport , etc . Similarly , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-section of skills , so they can unlock the power of collaboration . <p> 3 ) Every space must have an owner : Just like I wrote in a post last week , every community needs a community leader . This person ensures that the community is performing the task it was created to perform , that no one is vandalizing it , and that ideas are flowing freely in an environment that 's safe and productive . A good community leader will be able to start conversations and elicit feedback and creativity from others . If you have many leaders and power users , that 's fantastic ! However , to unlock the true power of the community , there must be one responsible party , a shepherd who guides it gently , without overpowering it . <p> 4 ) Every person needs a place : This is something that I have n't thought about prior to reading Grays post . Each employee in the organization must have his / her own place . That place can be physical ( desk ) , as well as digital ( user profile with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition , however fluid it is , still needs to identify what activities fall under the purvue of this person . A job without an " owner " wont get done . <p> 5 ) Serendipity on purpose : Gray draws a parallel between serendipity that can happen in the street of a city and the serendipity that 's possible in business human networks . Often through the use of Twitterm I 've been able to connect to people physically , because I identified them as being at the same event via the use of hashtags . Internally , I 'm seeing a lot of that on Yammer also ; posing an idea or topic of conversation in front of a community can often open your eyes to alternative ways of thinking and expertise from outside of your " world " . <p> 6 ) Watch , learn and adapt:Gray notes that a city , just like the complex organism of a company , must be flexible and empowered enough to evolve on its own . Within a company , there 's also a certain fluidity as ideas percolate , spread , gain support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or die . Same thing with organizational dynamics , processes , culture and makeup of the workforce . <p> I could n't agree more with Grays points above , and also would like to contribute the following three points : <p> 7 ) Leadership support : True strategic leadership can move the needle by providing vision and ensuring change works with existing culture ; this type of leadership supports and nurtures , while encouraging structure . Executive support and vision of how human collaboration networks fit into the larger picture are paramount . At Yammer , we 've observed that the most successful networks have the support and commitment of senior leadership , who can set an example and signal organizatonal transparency and " flatness " , without mandating policy in a top-down manner . <p> 8 ) Build infrastructure : Roads and streets are key to the health of a city . Roads carry people and goods to and from the city , and streets do the same on the inside . Similarly , in an organization , processes by which information is shared , and the manner in which resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exchange and collaboration platform like Yammer can become a virtual grid of streets connecting various parts of the organization , and connecting the organization to the outside . <p> 9 ) Policy and governance : Just like each city must have a charter and / or - some kind of governing document , each organizational endeavor must have some kind of governance / set of best practices set forth . In the case of using internal social networks , we encourage all of our users to create the usage policy , which outlines acceptable norms of behavior and data privacy guidelines . In the case of externally facing social media involvement , guidelines and policy should also be established that drive the organization forward . <p> Thank you , Dave Gray , for writing this post and for inspiring with your work ! I find the concept of building on wisdom of other industries fascinating and really productive . Instead of reinventing the wheel , we can borrow a lot of great ideas from the world around us . <p> So .. What are some other parallels to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours ! 
@@12024712 @624712/ <h> Is Your Social Strategy a House of Cards ? <p> By the Yammer team , on May 25 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> How often do you see businesses " get social " haphazardly , in a move that seems either a defense against competitors or an effort to avoid being " left behind " For any social endeavor inside a business , internal and external social alike , you need to ground your activities in strategy and some deep thinking . Because so much of social is about changing behaviors from the inside , making sure that you are culturally ready is task #1 . <p> However , without execution , cultural readiness is meaningless . Thus , its also imperative to examine the processes and tools that are going to actually help you execute . I like to think of these three elements in the same way as I think of a house . A house sits on a bedrock , and has a foundation , walls and a ceiling , none of which make sense on their own . Rather , they exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of cultural readiness as the bedrock : its the literal groundwork that supports the whole endeavor . Just like a bedrock , it has to be laid down first , before the foundation can be laid down . Building on top of sand vs. bedrock can topple the whole house , and so can building a social business without cultural readiness . <p> I think of business as the foundation . You are in business to produce a product or good for which people are willing to pay . Just like your houses foundation , your business definition and strategy will drive everything you do : what market you are in , what you produce , how you produce it , who your customers are , and how you service and acquire them . <p> I think of process as the walls of the house . To execute on your business , you will design many processes , just like there are many walls inside of a house . In a socially capable company , process is enabled by culture and while culture is about being , processes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes add definition to your strategy ; they tell you how you are going to get to where you are going . <p> Every house needs a ceiling , and every execution needs tools to execute with . Now that you have a solid vision and strategy , have laid out the processes and have a supportive culture , its time to get to the nitty-gritty and select the tools that can help you execute . Let 's consider a hypothetical example : <p> Launching social support and reducing service times <p> Company X has a business goal of providing better quality customer support by being more responsive and being available where the customer is . " Social support " triage and answering queries in social channels has been one key area of interest , but was approached with some reticence in the past . After some research and a pilot study , management sees that being available to talk to users in social channels is beneficial across the board : increasing customer satisfaction , cost reduction as well as boosting the company brand by becoming more social . The skeptics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , customers and " industry " alike . A movement that started in the employee echelons has now gained executive buy-in that allows it to become an organized and process-driven approach . <p> With support of the executive team , the company hires a social strategist , who works with the support team to set up the right channels and staff them properly . Please note that the solution here will depend on your particular situation : for some , its appropriate for support reps to work across channels ; for some , its appropriate to have a dedicated " social support " rep . How is a distressed tweet discovered , shared and cascaded ? Is there a Q&amp;A database that the support specialist can rely on ? Or is the product evolving so fast that documentation cant catch up ? In that case , how is knowledge shared internally to give the support specialist the information he or she needs ? <p> Recall that your second goal is to reduce service times for all service . To that end , your process should probably cover all support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . Are your support people and experts on the same platform ? Finally , how are you going to " launch " this effort ? Make sure that in the spirit of creating an open organization , you carefully walk the line between giving enough guidance , while leaving enough room for betterment of the process . Finally , make sure that your process openly supports your stated goals : 1 ) to become more available in social channels and 2 ) reduce service times in all channels . <p> Finally , we are getting into the tools conversation . Now that you have mapped out your processes , you need to also select the right tool(s) to execute . To give a personal example , here at Yammer , our support process relies on a blend of real-time and documented expertise . When a query comes in via Twitter , it gets cascaded to the right support people via a monitoring tool . Then it becomes either a support ticket or gets answered on the spot . If its a best practices conversation , I personally run with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support . If its a sales conversation , I loop in sales . We maintain an accurate record of all these conversations so we can track who said what and where . If an answer can be searched in the Yammer database of conversations , it gets surfaced and shared this is why establishing a sustainable taxonomy , such as tagging , is paramount . If the answer has changed due to product evolution , or if it does n't  exist , we ask in the public feed or in the right group ( whatever is appropriate ) and share the answer publicly with the customer . I must say , I 'd never be able to talk to customers externally if Yammer did n't  allow me to find the right expertise so quickly . <p> However you design your process , make sure that your tools support it . Also , make sure that culturally you are completely aligned and your processes do n't  block achievement of your goals . For example , if an organization insists on proofreading each tweet because it fears openness , no tool will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to examine your cultural readiness first . We wrote about it- here and here , and- you should absolutely check out this great video by the Deloitte Australia CEO , which narrates a really remarkable example of flattening the corporate culture through better communication and collaboration . <p> How have you used tools to execute on your process ? Has your culture supported what you wanted to do ? Or was it the opposite ? The comments are yours !

First seen primarily as a collaboration tool , these platforms have matured into efficiency drivers that yield value for users in a variety of ways . <p> This week , I talked to veteran social enterprise software advocates to find out how theyve achieved measurable gains with Yammer . Here are seven examples of ways you can derive value from going social . <p> 1 . Streamline Project Management <p> PerkStreet Financial sftware developers- use Yammer to facilitate scrum meetings , a key component of the agile software development methodology . Rather than hold their daily morning standup meetings in person , each member of the 37-person team posts " what I did yesterday , " " what I will do today " and " barriers to moving forward " using the hashtag #scrum . <p> The tag allows users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in when appropriate . The poster can also delegate tasks to others with the " @ " symbol. - COO Jason Henrichs said the newsfeed is like a perpetual meetingwithout having to interrupt your workflow . <p> " You contribute as it makes the most sense for you , " he said . <p> 2 . Augment Transparency and Accountability <p> Since PerkStreet hosts all conversations on Yammer rather than being trapped in someones inbox , management has continuous insight into the teams progress.This also prevents work duplication and redundancies because everyone is literally on the same page . <p> " If you look at someones scrum over time , you can see whether they actually accomplished what they said they were going to , " PerkStreet COO Jason Henrichs notes . <p> 3 . Increase Communications Efficiency <p> FlexJobs founder and CEO Sara Sutton Fell said Yammer drastically cut down on her need to email , call or schedule a meeting to check in . Every conversation immediately has context , so newcomers to the conversation do n't  have to repeat the same questions every time . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have to toggle between a bunch of different applications <p> In addition , users can respond as it fits in their workflow . " Instead of emails that feel like you have to respond immediately , putting it on Yammer ensures that only staff who have the time to check out the job will do so , " she says . <p> 4 . Find Experts Faster <p> Centerstance Inc . Managing Partner Greg Lueck says social enterprise apps have helped his sales staff answer deal-specific questions in the moment . He recalled one situation where a partner needed someone certified in Cast Iron software integration who spoke Mandarin . The resource manager working with the partner posted the query in Centerstances news feed . <p> " They had an answer within 30 seconds in Mandarin , " Lueck remembers . In this and similar scenarios , the employee would have otherwise " relied on a central repository of all companys experience that is located in one persons head , or nowhere at all . " <p> 5 . Better Leverage Information and Insights <p> Yammer has invested heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles , files and experts based on the users position , connections , group memberships and resources theyve previously accessed. - This capability ensures your intelligence assets are channeled to the right people . Companies said this " answers questions before our employees even know they have them . " <p> 6 . Generate More , Better Ideas <p> Yammer provides several means for employees to contribute ideas-from responding to queries and surveys , to posting ideas in a group discussion threads . Users receive gratification when co-workers and leadership " like " their contribution . Then , they are continually rewarded as they watch project teams bring the idea to fruition . <p> 7 . Boost Employee Recognition and Engagement <p> Sutton Fell said Yammer has also created a casual way for her team to post- up-to-the-minute employee recognition . She cited an example where a customer tweeted- - " Want to give props to @flexjobs for great customer service . Responded nicely and quickly to my annoying emails . " The marketing manager immediately copied the tweet into the companys Yammer feed , giving a shout out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially . Without Yammer , the company would n't have really had a logical place to post this feedback for all to see . The comment would n't warrant a company-wide email , but is still something the team could enjoy as the fruits of their labor . <p> " Everyone commented with their own positive encouragement and excitement over the compliment , which just builds on the recognition by engaging other staffers to boost each other up . " - Sutton Fell- said. - " It really brings us together in a positive way to encourage one another to keep doing good work , and its especially helpful considering were a virtual team . "

The way we share and learn has changed pretty dramatically ; we now find useful information and inspiration in unexpected places . While you will probably know what your team is doing , sometimes its more powerful to discover something that you did n't  even know existed , but can help you solve a problem . - How do you articulate the value of such serendipitous discoveries and interactions ? Its tough to quantify their non-linear value with linear measurement applied to traditional business problems , which had clear inputs and outputs . We need to update our thinking to begin to understand the impact and value of serendipity , - and that 's exactly what we did during an enlightening webinar with rockstar panelists- Brian Cator , - Sr. Director of Communications and Store Operations at 7-11 , and- Daniel Rasmus , analyst , author , strategist and knowledge economy pioneer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serendipity in the workplace , and started realizing that there were currents taking place in these networks that were not being captured by traditional measures . In his whitepaper , - Dan discusses 6 main differences between the traditional economy and serendipity economy : <p> Process of creation is separate from value realization : In social networks , the value of shared content ( a question , a note , a document , etc ) can not be immediately assessed . <p> Time delay of value : It may be weeks or months since your original post until something happens . <p> External validation is required : It may be unclear whether or not your content has created value ; you will need external validation to gauge its business value . <p> Dynamic configuration : Social networks are dynamic by definition you never know who is going to read or respond to your post . <p> Un-forecastable value : Looking at the network in the present can not anticipate its value in the future , especially as networks are dynamic . <p> Undefined potential : In a dynamic network , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential . <p> To learn more about the serendipity economy , please download the paper here . <p> Brian Cator shared how 7-11 adopted Yammer . They launched the Yammer network without expectation of ROI , leaving room for opportunity . Deploying Yammer was a part of a restructuring effort , with the end goal of getting field consultants out of the office and into the stores . The goal was to provide a sense of community and teamwork , and although the network allowed exactly for that , the 7-11 team was able to uncover intended and unintended benefits : <p> Greater cross-pollination and redefinition of a team : The organization was structured around divisional and regional offices . After Yammer was introduced , people in different parts of the world were able to communicate with offices and people they werent talking to prior . It effectively helped the redefine the notion of a team beyond just the number of people you could fit in a conference room . <p> Barometer for success : Most active groups in the 7-11 network were also the most profitable markets . Unsurprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management style ( which was highlighted via interactions on Yammer ) and financial performance of stores . Because success breeds success , best performers shared their best practices , and management was able to develop strategies for underperformers . Yammer conversations also added a qualitative aspect to 7-11s analysis . " You can pour over data and analytics , but until you have an engaging conversation with your peers , you are not going to get the full benefit of the data and be able to collaboration and understand the data , " advised Brian Cator . <p> People respond to simple human gestures : The 7-11 team astutely noted that people want to be acknowledged , and an enterprise social network enables this behavior by lowering the barrier to calling out good work publicly . Being able to share their knowledge , to congratulate others , and have their work noticed , has driven more participation and thus more discovery and sharing across the 7-11 network . <p> One serendipitous event happening on its own is a happy accident . Encouraging serendipity to systematically occur takes strategy and planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategies to success outlined by Brian and Dan : <p> Go big or go home : Launching a large network will drive better and bigger results . <p> Integrate social profiles with performance : By asking people to create profiles and tying performance to them , you help build in and emphasize accountability . <p> Make the system accessible : Make it easy for people to log in and get involved , and focus on lowering the barriers to communication . <p> Give people permission to collaborate : " If you are afraid of people saying the wrong thing , do n't  be . " advised the panelists . You have to exhibit leadership by focusing on what you want people to do vs. not do . <p> Track success and learn from failure : Every time that the social network has helped you reach a business objective , tag it with a " success tag " . It will help you quantify success across many dimensions , across use cases and over time . <p> Look beyond productivity and efficiency : Do n't  limit yourself by focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency is a huge benefit , make sure you allow for further-reaching effects . <p> Executives should lead by doing : Make sure the executives are involved it legitimizes the effort and makes it OK for people to post . Furthermore , listening to the " field " can help the " boardroom " make better decisions . Brian says that its imperative to get execs over the " everything I say is policy " mentality . <p> Celebrate value : Want people to do more of what 's working ? Praise them , celebrate that value and recognize what the organization gained . <p> Be patient : Change does n't  happen overnight , it will take place over a longer period of time than many of us are used to . <p> Voluntary adoption is key : At 7-11 , Yammer adoption was not mandatory ; they encouraged everyone to sign up .

Yet that 's exactly how it happened back in 2003 . <p> Years ago , in Melbourne , Australia , Travis Garone , Adams brother , and their friend Luke Slattery decided the moustache needed to make a comeback . That year , thirty men , including Adam , grew moustaches for the month of Movember . The rules were simple ; start on Movember 1st clean-shaven and spend the remainder of the month growing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fundraising that year ; the idea was simply to see who could grow the better moustache . <p> In 2004 , Adam and the other Founders workshopped the idea of adding an official cause to legitimize growing a Mo- thus began the maiden Movember journey. - Adam established Movember as a not for profit entity and chose prostate cancer as the cause , so that men were given an opportunity to support a serious disease that affected them . Much like the pink ribbon , Adam felt that the moustache was the perfect hairy ribbon for mens health . <p> 450 Mo Bros took part in Movember 2004 , and to everyones surprise , they raised $54,000 through friends and familys donations to their Mo-growing efforts . It was the largest single donation the Prostate Cancer Foundation in Australia had ever received . Adam then realized that the moustache could be Movembers ribbon , the catalyst for conversation and one which would effectively turn each participant known as a Mo Bro into a walking , talking billboard for mens health for 30 days . <p> About Adam Garone : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing and marketing emerging web and mobile technologies working with companies such as Vodafone. - Prior to Adams corporate experience , he served for 9 years as an officer in the Australian Army where he was selected to join the special forces . - Adams military career taught him the art of leadership and intricacies of operations management. - In 2008 , Adam won the 22nd annual Ernst &amp; Young ( E&amp;Y ) " Entrepreneur of the Year " award in Australia . This award is the worlds most prestigious business award for awards programs in more than 135 cities in 50 countries . " - In 2009 , Melbourne Business School awarded Adam with the Outstanding Recent Alumnus Award. - Adam currently lives in Southern California where he oversees Movembers global operations . His vision is that the moustache and Movember will soon have the same global impact on cancers affecting men that the pink ribbon has for breast cancer .

@@12024716 @624716/ <h> How Healthy Is Your Community ? <p> By the Yammer team , on August 5 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> What do you think of when you think of a healthy community ? Undoubtedly , your mind conjures up a group of passionate and engaged users who share best practices , ask and answer each others questions , and push each other to improve . The mood in this community is constructive and honest when people share their achievements , others congratulate them ; when people share difficulties , others support them ; when people ask questions , others share ; when people say something that others do n't  agree with , others disagree . <p> Weve written about maintaining health in your network here . But how do you know if your network is healthy ? What are the key indicators for health ? I am personally lucky in that I straddle external and internal communities and see similarities , as well as differences , in both . <p> One of my favorite works on community health indicator was published by Lithium and authored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on external communities , Michael lists the following key attributes of a healthy community : growth , useful content , popularity , responsiveness , interactivity , and liveliness . Let 's explore each one and see how they relate to internal communities . <p> Growth : To be successful , each community must have people in it . A community that performs well in this dimension , must have a solid initial burst of growth , as well as continue growth steadily . While everyone likes a big community , quality of membership is also important , so make sure you are inviting the right people . One key difference between growth of internal and external communities is that an external community could potentially involve anyone from a narrowly or broadly defined universe of members . If you run a customer community , it can always get bigger , as you get more customers . In an internal community , you have a natural ceiling of the number of people in your organization . <p> Usefulness : Usefulness is a key determinant of your communitys current and future health , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their job , whatever it happens to be . In both internal and external communities , usefulness can be measured by explicit feedback , such as numbers of posts and comments and content ratings . In an internal network , usefulness can also be measured by implicit feedback , such as productivity gains from using the communitys information . <p> Popularity : Popularity of your community can be determined by visits to the community , number of members . Its important to account for explicit engagement via unique posters , as well as active lurking . Unlike an externally open community , where traffic to your community can be linked to search results , in an internal community , you should be measuring numbers of posters , readers and subscribers . <p> Responsiveness : For people to want to contribute to your community , they should feel like doing so is going to get a result . You are much more likely to post a question if you get a response vs. not getting a response ; getting a faster response is better also . Our research also shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the number of comments in that thread . In most networks , threads that get a response within 10 minutes receive 10% more comments than threads that a response within the hour , and 30%-40% more comments than threads that get a response after the first day. - You are also more likely to share an experience , best practice , tip or news item , if you can be somewhat certain that it will get a response . In a previous article , we determined that 41% of new Yammer users come back and post if people comment on their content . <p> Interactivity : Going along with the point above , interaction between community members is a key determinant of community health . In an internal , as well as external community , interaction can be captured by looking at the number of participants in each thread , as well as thread depth ( number of comments ) . Moreover , you should strive to ensure that each thread has as many unique participants as possible i.e. a thread with 20 comments contributed by 2 people is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 people . In an internal network , interactivity is a concept related to the goal of breaking down information silos . As a manager of internal community , your goal should be reaching across departments and encouraging people to contribute . <p> Liveliness &amp; buzz : This is a subjective measure of how the community feels . Is it alive with buzz and conversation ? All of the dimensions described above are directly responsible for the liveliness and buzz of the community . <p> Positive atmosphere : Another subjective dimension of the communitys health is the degree of civility that occurs between members . A healthy community welcomes disagreement and discourse ; after all , if everyone agreed , that would be a very boring community . Our CEO David Sacks spoke to the New York Times about the culture of dissent that characterizes Yammer . Dissent is good for communities , because it allows for new ideas to rise to the top and for status quo to be challenged . However , its important to the health of any community to be civil and respectful , while engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of culture in your community by creating and enforcing a code of conduct , as well as by encouraging discussions . In an internal network , a positive atmosphere is extremely important ; how you are treated and responded to in a public work-related forum is going got contribute to your job satisfaction and engagement . <p> While growth and popularity are determined by where the community is in its lifecycle , the make-up of its members is directly responsible for usefulness , interactivity and responsiveness . Individual community members range in their levels of engagement from very active super-users , to occasional users , to- active lurkers , all the way to inactive lurkers . One of our esteemed customers and community members Sue Gautsch from Pepperdine University contributed this engagement continuum that explores the actions that various users can take in the community . <p> So let me turn it over to you .. - Do you agree with the dimensions outlined by Michael Wu ?

@@12024720 @624720/ <h> Yammer At IKEA : Collaboration And Innovation At Global Scale <p> By the Yammer team , on August 16 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Connecting employees across departments , countries and cultures is what Yammer is all about , and these needs are really pronounced across large , multinational retail environments . We are thrilled to welcome IKEA to the Yammer family , as the iconic retailer is launching Yammer to help its collaborative workforce connect better online . I sat down with Linda Tinnert , the Intranet Manager at IKEA , and this is what we talked about : <p> Maria Ogneva : - Linda , thank you for joining us ! Please introduce yourself and tell us what you do at IKEA.Linda Tinnert : - I work in group staff corporate communication at IKEA Services AB ; I 'm responsible for internal digital channels . Ive been with IKEA and worked with internal communications for about 14 years and have been involved in IKEAs internal digital channels efforts for the past 8-9 years . <p> MO : - How has your internal communication evolved ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; our intranet started out as a pretty traditional one , mostly used for information delivery and one-way conversations . In 2000/2001 we introduced our own publishing platform that facilitated discussion forums . Four years ago , we moved to Microsoft SharePoint , introducing the ability to comment on news. - But we could see that something was missing people kept asking for better ways to collaborate and communicate . A lot happens when you meet face-to-face , and we wanted to extend that to the digital world . We have formal networks established at IKEA , and we also have a lot of informal networks that are really important. - So we started to look into tools that could support and strengthen our already existing way of working and networking . After evaluating Enterprise Social Networks on the market , we decided on Yammer . <p> Yammer can work for us at IKEA , because we have a very collaborative culture . Our informal networks are strong , and " knowing people " is valued as part of career development . <p> MO : - How did you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference everybody was talking about it . This discovery came at a very opportune time , and I decided to sign up . At that time , I was looking to find a solution for our Internet Groups needs . Spread across 25 countries , our Internet Group maintains all the public sites of IKEA.com . They had a discussion forum but werent able to share best practices or documents . They kept duplicating work and wasting a lot of time asking and answering the same questions. - We introduced Yammer to this group as our pilot , and they found quite a bit of success with it . A naturally tech-savvy group , they really took to Yammer and were able to adopt it . <p> MO : - Who uses Yammer at IKEA ? LT : - We have piloted Yammer across three types of groups : <p> Type One : Professionals who work together through a matrix but are disconnected geographically like our Internet Group . Because they have access to the same information , we discovered that a lot of team members were asking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more time to spend on their job , because they only have to answer the same question once , and Yammer makes the solution findable by others . <p> Type Two : Fast-paced , on-the-phones &amp; computers type workplace . These IKEA professionals are in the same location yet still have a high need for connecting to others who are available and might " know the answer . " Although slower to adopt Yammer , potentially due to a less web-savvy background , the Contact Centre has realised benefits to being able to help each other to answer customers quickly and with the best solution possible . Contact Centre Representatives need to be plugged into the work of the entire company in order to service customers effectively . <p> Type Three : Where the Content is the Glue . The third type of group that we focused on during our pilot was one that contains many professionals , across many disciplines , who need to connect around a similar topic . For instance , we have a Yammer Group called " Digital Workplace , " and it is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for a company-wide rollout of Yammer . As a global company , we need to think through how we work within the legalities and peculiarities of local countries . <p> - MO : - How do you plan to launch Yammer ? LT : - First and foremost , we are making sure that we are ready to address and navigate the complex global legal environment . We have learned a great deal from working with all of our countries and preparing the Terms of Use . We have also been working cross-functionally to ensure buy-in across the organisation . IT is on board , as are the security and legal teams . For a successful Yammer implementation , you need both executive sponsorship and adoption through the ranks . Our rollout strategy has a three-pronged approach , from highly coordinated , to coached , to very organic : <p> Highly coordinated : We have defined some groups that will get extra coaching and support from our central team . <p> Coached : We have prepared a team of internal communicators across all countries in which we have operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support in the business . <p> Organic : We do expect that many groups will take off on their own . We have set the guideline with our Terms of Use , and we have a very strong culture , so we are curious to see what our coworkers come up with ! And we are already seeing early adapters , who are strong with social tools , showing others the way . <p> MO : - What kind of education programmes are you planning for the launch ? LT : - Yammer is really easy to use , and we 've already provided some basic principles around publishing . We are working on providing business context towards meeting our organisational goals . <p> MO : - Youve mentioned a key imperative for Yammer is to help people build better working relationships . That often carries with it cultural changes toward more openness . Can you talk about the ways in which Yammer has changed your culture thus far ? LT : - We have a culture based on collaboration , and we aim to help each other and work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hands-on culture if you want something done , ask for help ; if you have the solution , give help ! Through this kind of culture you build a strong informal network that will help you to become efficient . A strong network is great for people whove been around for a while ; however , an organisation with such strong ties can be intimidating to a newcomer . <p> I believe that Yammer will be a great platform for us here because we have a very collaborative culture . With Yammer , you immediately have access to a variety of people and you can more easily build your network outside of your immediate circle of influence . We hope to be able to surface information easier and faster and take our way of building relationships to another level . <p> About Linda Tinnert : - Linda has been working at IKEA since 1998 , focusing on internal communications . Linda has been responsible for the global intranet since 2002 , and responsible for all internal digital channels with the focus on communication information and knowledge sharing since 2012. @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024721 @624721/ <h> Say Goodbye To The Full Email Inbox <p> By the Yammer team , on April 20 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> We 've all been there . You 're coming back to the office after being out for a while . A few days , a week , *gasp* a few weeks . And you know what 's waiting for you A huge pile of unread email , and the grueling job of going through it to catch up with what you missed . <p> The folks at Yammer sympathize with you . I just came back from a few days in sunny Arizona , and I also had to catch up , but it only took me an hour or two to do it . During that time , I was inspired to write this post about how Yammer messages beat a full email inbox any day . The reasons are : visibility , usability , and relevance . <h> Yammer messages are highly visible <p> This is the easiest benefit to see , and perhaps the biggest win . - People cant take on your email workload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know about it. - Yammer messages , however , are out in the open , and thus anyone who sees them can take action . When an issue comes in , it does n't  stay hidden and even worse escalate and pile on , until you get back . Many times you 'll find that someone else had already chimed in to help . Because the whole conversation is still there , you can see who 's involved and you know if there 's more to be done . As a result , you just reduced your to-do list dramatically ! <h> Yammer helps you divide and conquer <p> Yammer networks are centered around the idea of groups . You can create these separate workspaces for anything based on need : departments , projects , recurring social events , or a place to share recipes with your co-workers . The idea is that some of these will have messages you want to see right away , like the group for your current hot project . And some will be things you can get to at your leisure . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count of your unread messages . For example , I can see that there are 5 messages for the Engineering group that I need to see , along with 20+ messages in the Book Club group to discuss the latest read . Ill hit those 5 and move on with my day knowing I did n't  miss anything important ( especially if I did n't  finish the book ) . <p> As a result , you can now confidently skip lots of messages because they 're not relevant to you , while focusing on the mission-critical messages to help you get back up to speed . This is sounding better already , right ? <h> Yammer helps you decide what 's important <p> Another issue that makes a wall of unread emails frustrating is that you know many of them do n't  require your direct attention . Perhaps someone cced you as a courtesy . Maybe someone was n't sure who should get the message , and the recipient list is huge . In email , you cant see which ones require action , and which ones are " nice to know " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> Yammer messages are delivered to groups , not just individuals ( though this is also possible ) . In fact , its common not to list individuals at all . Because everyone can see the message , anyone in the group who 's knowledgeable can field the question . Yammer allows your co-workers to also add you to the cc : recipient list for a message , which sends you a notification . <h> Do n't  be afraid to leave the office for too long <p> We took the pile of unread email and turned it into groups of unread messages that already have markers of importance and relevance . This is a powerful workflow , and a shift from the usual way people interact with email . If you 've ever tried to set up automatic filtering and labeling in email clients , you know that getting it right is also a frustrating experience , which takes a lot of time and curation . <p> Yammer strives to create an environment where everyone helps organize things by default , so the burden of organization does n't  rest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer , I get very few emails these days . Weve seen this trend across lots of our customer as well , with reports of 30%-50% fewer emails at our customers who fully embrace posting to Yammer . <p> Its important to note that Yammer works best when we all pitch in . Aside from just getting your co-workers to give it a try , it pays to encourage the behavior that reduces noise and increases relevance for everyone . Encourage others to practice good etiquette : target your messages to groups of people instead of individuals , create groups as needed , and , most importantly , share more things . You cant help your coworkers act on emails that are hidden in their inboxes , so encourage sharing ! <p> If you want to avoid the dreaded full email inbox , Yammer can help . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024725 @624725/ <h> ABB Reinvents Its Intranet with Social Networking Technology <p> By the Yammer team , on January 28 , 2015May 25 , 2016 0Shares <p> A leader in power and automation technologies , - ABB- supplies power grids , industrial motors , drives and generators for industrial , commercial and utility operations . To read the entire ABB customer story , visit the Yammer customers page . <p> In 2012 , ABB decided its corporate intranet was n't meeting the companys need for a comprehensive platform that would connect and empower its widespread international workforce . The intranets content-management system was more than a decade old and out of date . It had poor search functionality and information was often added instead of changed , resulting in different versions of the same content . Adding to the confusion and inefficiency was the fact that the intranet was just one of many places where people stored information , including local file servers , wikis and other knowledge platforms . <p> ABB decided to replace that outmoded intranet with a powerful , socially-enabled one that the company calls Inside+ . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBs " enterprise front door , " providing staff with an entry point to all the information and tools that they need to do their jobs , including the Microsoft Office 365 suite and current company news . By late 2014 , Inside+ was being used by 30,000 people per day , and the results have been impressive . " Instead of 20 different tools , we have one integrated solution that does it all , " says Group Vice President and Head of Digital Communications Mark Seall . " Inside+ gives our people everything they need to work as efficiently as possible . " <p> All of the companys key internal platforms are integrated into Inside+ , with individualized Yammer feeds occupying the left half of the landing page . " My Yammer feed shows me emails , updates to documents I 've been working oneverything I need to do my job , " Seall explains . Other core Office 365 applications are only a click or two away . " For instance , Microsoft SharePoint is an important part of most peoples work day , and they can access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SharePoint is n't just easy to get to , its part of the intranets internal search , ensuring that documents people are collaborating on do n't  get lost in the shuffle . <p> Connectingand Listening toStaff All Over the Globe <p> " Organizations are made of people , and much of the success of an organization rests on the knowledge in peoples heads and how they make use of it , " Seall says . " Therefore an intranet should not only connect people with content , but with other people . Yammer does that for us . You can get answers , even when you do n't  know who to ask . Just put your question out , and the experts will find you . " <p> Using Yammer as a platform for listening is paying off in other ways at ABB . For instance , instead of flying roughly 100 employees to its Zurich headquarters for an annual communications conference , the company ran the conference virtually in 2012 and 2013 , with all discussion housed and archived on Yammer . The engagement was impressive : during one 24-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adapting to Challenges and Sharing Success <p> As ABB personnel increasingly embrace the fluid discussion that Yammer enables , email has been reduced . For instance , Seall estimates that his teams inboxes have shrunk by 50 percent . " Even better , moving conversations from email to Yammer makes discussions more productive , " he says . " We have seen an increase in both engagement and effectiveness . " <p> Another thing that makes ABB staff more productive is anywhere , anytime access to Inside+ and Office 365 . People tap in on smartphones and tablets when they 're home , on the road , or on the factory floor . " We find that more than half of the comments people are posting come in from mobile devices , " Seall reports . <p> Growing into Socially Enabled Success <p> In keeping with its brand , " Power and productivity for a better world , " ABB is leveraging the power of social networking to boost productivity for a better enterprise . " This is an inevitable change and organizations are going to have to work like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits that digital collaboration offers to enterprises like ABB are massive . Our intranet is the first step toward fully leveraging this value , enabling the organization to work as a network . "

Engaged employees are better equipped and willing to advocate on behalf of the company , and pass this engagement on to customers . They are also more productive and ultimately create financial benefits . However , the data told us that employees are largely unengaged . So what do we do now ? Engagement is not something that you can make people do , or develop a program around . <p> We need to create environments that cultivate employee engagement and passion ; think of it as gardening . What can we do to create these kinds of environments ? <h> The basics : safety <p> Before we further , its important to address the very basic physical needs and psychological needs . One of these psychological needs is the feeling of safety , and it is critical for employees to feel engaged in the workplace .

If you are always in fear of losing your job , you will be primarily concerned with finding your next job , and less likely to take risks for fear of " rocking the boat . " Companies that do n't  take risks do n't  innovate ; they stagnate . <h> Create a flexible work environment <p> The benefits of flexible environments - in the form of flex-time , workshifting , onsite wellness programs - can also boost - engagement. - In an increasingly demanding and hectic world , the 9-5 paradigm no longer holds , and employees feel squeezed . To be truly productive , they need the flexibility to get done what they need to get done on their terms . <h> Work with purpose <p> Dan Pink describes Purpose as one of the pillars of motivation a belief in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a widget . Leaving a legacy is part of mans quintessential search for meaning ; are you helping employees do something meaningful ? Does your mission inspire ? Do your employees even know what your mission is ? <p> At Yammer , we are driven by the desire to change the way the world works ; nothing short of that . - Yammers purpose is to make companies more open , transparent , agile and able to deal with rapid change . In the end , we engender these values ourselves we are what we build . <p> " Culture is what tells us what to do in the absence of explicit rules and instructions which is most of the time . Its a value system . It keeps us in sync and working towards the company mission without the need to be micromanaged all the time. - At Yammer , we try to be open to dissent ; we require that dissent be constructive and respectful , but we always want people to feel like they can tell us what they think . We need that open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond internal culture , this mindset applies to the dialogue we want to have with customers as well . " <h> Establish role clarity with flexiblity <p> In this volatile world of ours , fluidity and ability to respond to change are competitive differentiators . In this kind of an environment , as an employee , it can be difficult to understand what your role actually is . While its important to allow employees to chart their own path and adjust their roles to meet the changing needs of the business , certain clarity around roles is also necessary . Without clarity of vision , people become frustrated and " check out " mentally . Lack of clarity can lead to uneven distribution of work , affecting morale and increasing burnout ; it can also lead to duplication of efforts , which is wasteful and frustrating . <h> Recognize publicly <p> In " How to win friends and influence people , " Dale Carnegie said : " Give honest , sincere appreciation .

In the transparent world we live in , every misstep can be discovered and amplified through social media ( do you remember GoDaddys CEO- Bob Parsons hunting elephants ? ) A connection to the companys value system can make the difference between making a sale or not . In this kind of world , what you do matters and so does- how you get there . <h> Empower employees to take action <p> Employees largely want to do the right thing , but do n't  always know how .

Because process breaks down when you handle exceptions , you need to free information and communication channels , so that the right resources are never out of reach . Give employees access to the latest information so that they can become effective brand ambassadors . <h> Decentralize <p> A decentralized organization will be naturally more effective at handling exceptions . In a decentralized organization , - autonomous decision making and operations allow to move quickly and deliver the desired product or service to the market . Dave Gray of Dachis Group calls these units pods and believes that this kind of setup is imperative to thriving in a dynamic and volatile environment .

First and foremost , attendees learned that a Responsive Organization learns and responds rapidly through open communication , experimentation , and working as a network . In addition to hearing from experts Pisoni and Grafham , YammerTV participants posed questions to the main presenters about how best to become a more Responsive Organization . <p> The following are the top six questions asked by the audience : <h> How to get buy-in from management and employees <p> How do I get buy-in from management to start a Responsive Organization ? - Answered by Adam.Dont give a giant explanation of the Responsive Organization . Pick a project and start working differently to prove it . Call it an " experiment " if you need approval . Present it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives are extremely busy and need reasons to do things , especially when change is involved . <p> How do you encourage employees to use Yammer ? - Answered by Mike . Do n't  encourage them to use Yammer ; encourage them to think about connecting with their colleagues differently in order to get their work done better . Invite your co-workers to an experiment , and get them to experience the benefit of working differently with social . Yammers just a vehicle for that experience . Alternatively , show them success stories that people in similar roles to theirs have had and encourage them to try their own experiments . <h> Answers to concerns over open information <p> Does the Responsive Organization philosophy consider all information useful ? - Answered by Adam.Not all information is useful , but the mistake we make is assuming we know what information is useful for everyone else . What we find is that some information we have , which we did n't  think was that useful , turns out to be extremely useful to others. - Transparency uncovers these surprises . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Yammer ? - Answered by Mike.Our customers tend to protect this by giving guidance to users in usage policies and training , as well as through the use of private groups when the nature of the information being discussed necessitates it . It is important to note , though , that you should apply a principle of - " dare to share " rather than " need to know " when it comes to deciding whether to share information or not , because transparency is a key driver of responsiveness . <h> How to structure your organization for success <p> How do you balance the Network organizational structure within a Responsive Organization and the human nature of hierarchy ? - Answered by Adam.I think were only beginning to explore the balance between hierarchies and networks . In truth well probably need both : networks of hierarchies and hierarchies of networks . To understand where the hierarchy is failing , look for places where change is particularly difficult , or where people seem unhappy doing what they 're supposed to do . Or , look to where people are having lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken hierarchy as they are usually held to give a status update , inform other groups , or ask other groups to do things for you . These are areas where working as a network negates the need for as many meetings . <p> What is the ideal company size for using Yammer ? - Answered by Mike.There is n't really an ideal company size for Yammer . We work with organizations that have less than 10 people to some of the largest companies in the world . The challenges all of these companies face is actually pretty similar : keeping people on the same page , understanding what the organization knows about a particular topic , and responding quickly to a much faster , changing world . <p> If you 're interested in becoming a more Responsive Organization or have questions , please leave comments or questions below .

As a- Professor of Management in Santa Clara Universitys Leavey School of Business , GigaOm blogger on the subject , and author of the forthcoming book , - The Plugged-In Manager , Terri definitely has some wisdom to share . I wanted to capture some of Terris thoughts , so I sat down for a brief Q&amp;A with her . This is what we talked about <p> Maria Ogneva : What can you tell us about yourself that we may not be able to glean from your bio ? <p> Terri Griffith : I 'm one of those people who ca n't leave a campfire alone there is probably just the perfect piece of wood to add or the perfect push that will make it a little bit better . I think this goes along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology ; emphasis on the " work " and " with . " The work has to come first and then we should be thinking about the people , the technology , and the organization that will help get that work done . I 'm always looking for those fine-grained adjustments that will make our work better in some way . I did my graduate work at Carnegie Mellon as they have always had a focus on interdisciplinary research . Starting in 1984 I had the chance to look at telecommuting it was a very different work then ! Great to see work design change so much . <p> MO : - You teach Management and Organizational Design at Santa Clara University . How has the discipline changed over the past few years ? <p> TG : For me the biggest issue is that we need to change is how we do our research . It used to be that we could study how a particular technology was used in an organization and learn more about effects like anonymity in brainstorming , the role of response time in email communications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the technologies change too quickly for these studies to make sense . It can take us a year to collect the data and a two to three years ( at least ! ) - to get a paper through the formal publication process . By then the technology has changed so much that the results are n't  helpful . I love the peer-review process that keeps our research standards high but we need to shift to studying how individuals and teams make design decisions with whatever technology they have at the moment . I have a chapter coming out where I make that claim to my colleagues . I hope they 're listening . <p> MO : What do you think is the future of the organizational design ? <p> TG : I think the future will be much more flexible with a greater emphasis on personal accountability. - Freelancing , elancing , and even just shorter time in any one position seems to be the new dynamic . This means our organizational designs need to be built so people can onboard quickly and adjust their roles and tools as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your book " Plugged-in manager . " Why ? Who is the plugged in manager ? <p> TG : The title took a ton of work and I have to give credit to one of the Jossey-Bass Publishing salespeople . We went around and around for six months . The academic term my colleagues and I use for the ability to see options across human , technical , and organizational dimensions , is " systems savvy , " but that makes people think were just talking about information systems and being plugged-in is much more than that . A plugged-in manager , individual contributor , team member , or executive is someone who thinks about a situation and sees options across all three of the dimensions ( people , tech , organization ) and then figures out how to mix them together in a way that will be effective in the particular setting . The technology can be anything from a hammer to a Yammer . <p> MO : - You talk about the 3 practices of plugged-in management . What are they ? <p> TG : - Stop-Look-Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop-Look-Listen reminds us to not chase the ball into the street or in this case , not to grab for every shiny technology or new organizational fad that comes around . Stop for a moment and consider your needs . Look and see the options you have or could get . After you take your first steps , listen for feedback . <p> Mixing is at the heart of a plugged-in managers skill set . Once you know your options , what will be the best mix across the people , technology , and organizational process ? In the book , I talk about being a great chef versus a novice cook. - The novice will follow someone elses recipe step by step . The great chef will use a recipe as inspiration , but then change the recipe to match the ingredients at hand and the particular audience for the meal . I also use negotiation as a way of thinking about this process inside an organization . We negotiate the change using the different people , technology , and process issues on the table . <p> Sharing makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share with others what you are doing and why , they can start to help you with the process . Try " thinking out loud " as you stop-look-listen and mix . You may get great ideas from your colleagues , they may learn the value of the approach , and/or the implementation process will be easier as people will understand why youre doing the things you 're doing . This is a book that is meant to be shared . <p> MO : You talk about the need for transparency and the " need to share " replacing the " need to know " . However , transparency is not as easy as ordering it off the Internet organizational culture can be a hindrance . How do you address that in your organization ? <p> TG : - My own organization is relatively traditional . Santa Clara University is the oldest university in California ( founded in 1851 UC Berkeley , where I got my BA , was n't founded until 1968 ) . Universities as a whole are fairly traditional organizations . Private universities , especially , are coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provost , and they are interested in these ideas , while still being concerned about keeping our high standards and reputation . That said , I created a blog post a couple of weeks ago asking my community " what does transparency mean to you ? " I added " To me , and this is my personal view not that of the Task Force I 'm the chair of our communication &amp; collaboration task force , it means working in the public to the degree possible . It also means proactively sharing as work moves along . " I have n't received a single comment on that post . <p> So , to answer your question , we are working on these ideas slowly . We teach the value of transparency and have been since the 70s . Until recently it was very hard for organizations to be transparent , even internally . Technology tools like blogging , dashboards , collaborative documents , wikis , and the like make it much easier but technologies change much more quickly than do ingrained organizational practices . <p> My advice is to understand your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial services firm , or a company preparing to go public , there may be laws about how transparent you can be ) . Then think about how the process of being transparent can be mixed in with different technology tools and perhaps modelled by influential people in the organization . Finally , share as much as possible about why transparency can add value and share the stories of others . I often recommend Warren Bennis essay in the book Transparency : CreatingaCultureofCandor I discovered the book when someone shared it with me . <p> MO : How do you cultivate the ability ( and desire ) to plug in ? Should you ever " unplug " <p> It can be very plugged-in to " unplug . " Being plugged-in means being connected to the dimensions but not that you have to use all of them all of the time . I love it when a teammate tells me that they 're going to be offline for a while . It let 's me know how to better coordinate the work , and I appreciate that they are spending time away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one insight that you want readers to take away from your book , what would it be ? <p> This is the perfect time to be trying out plugged-in ideas . We are all working with reduced resources get the most out of what you have by being thoughtful about how you mix together your human , technology , and organizational assets . <p> About Terri Griffith : <p> Terri Griffith is a Professor in Santa Clara Universitys Leavey School of Business and author of the book , - The Plugged-In Manager . She studies how we mix together the technology of work ( everything from telepresence to the size and type of tools a crew would use to build a fence ) , the way we organize to do this work ( virtual teams , collaborative leadership , hiring and pay plans ) , and the knowledge , skills , and abilities of the people we work with .

Todays hyper-connected environment has led to an abundance of resources , people and complexity . Project management can feel especially chaotic if we try to hold on to the old ways of doing things . The fine art of coordinating is n't as polished in this information-saturated world . Project Managers seem instead like Ringmasters : herding clowns , taming lions and redirecting random firecrackers as they propel the troupe toward a final deadline . <p> These challenges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take advantage of complexity and abundance of information to deliver more successful projects ? <p> 1 . Involve and engage people around the world like never before <p> You cant make people become engaged in a change you 're leading . However , if you give them a voice and the opportunity to get involved , they may become engaged as a result ; they will be engaged because they wanted to , not because you made them . It has previously been too logistically challenging and too expensive to involve people from different locations - in a meaningful way . Its rather impractical to fly people from all over the world during every stage of the project . But if one-off focus groups make a difference , imagine the potential if that involvement could be throughout the project <p> Social networking creates opportunities we never had before . Everyone is given a voice and the opportunity to be involved . Physical location and position in the organizational chart no longer need to be barriers . Leaders can share their vision and objectives , and people can be invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by everyone ; rather decisions can be informed by everyone . Guidance and support can be offered by not only the center , but also by employees on the ground. <p> 2 . Value is n't based on volume <p> Typically , organizational departments are seen as and often see themselves as the creators of materials in their subject matter expertise . For example , the Marketing department creates Marketing collateral and materials , the Communications department creates guidance on internal and external communication , and the Sales department makes you guessed it ! sales . These divisions were created during the Industrial Age , because it was easier to organise people in departments performing a similar function . It became the accepted workflow . <p> The Internet Age makes everyone a creator . There 's oftentimes more potential value to be created from outside the department than in it . Were seeing the role of departments shift towards identifying , coordinating and tapping into ideas , expertise and energy irrespective of where contributors are located . The role of any project manager then becomes to ask the right questions and create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , you must design it for openness so others can continue to contribute and enhance the original creation . <p> The good news is that as traditional hierarchies are being replaced by more loosly-structured non-linear self-organizing systems , you have a larger potential group of people to work with . <p> Project Managers have become accustomed to the concept of an end-point a fixed point in time where the project is complete . After the end-point , the team transitions to a business-as-usual mindset and people move onto the next project . <p> However , we are living in a world of constant change , where business-as-usual means fluidity and evolution . This requires a radically new approach : rapidly design and roll out initial stages of the project , measure the results , and adjust your approach . For example , instead of ripping and replacing your HR Policy every three years , the policy can live and evolve with the company . Social and collaborative technologies allow people to constantly feedback and improve upon the original creation . This can initially feel frustrating to those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like we are constantly updating a project , policy and calendar without moving forward . However , by constantly adjusting and refining a project while its on course , we will continue to deliver a better experience one that adapts with the organisation . <p> As you adjust your mindset and way of working to support todays communication paradigms , the important thing is to not do away with process completely. - A completely free-flowing project will soon descend into madness , even if it has a Ringmaster . <p> The challenge is to critically evaluate your objectives , create only as much process and structure as you need , and let people do what they 're best at . <p> So how would you conduct your orchestra ? <p> About Bryony Cole : Bryony is passionate about inspiring people to harness the power of social media , technology and community .

Four prominent start-ups Groupon , Zynga and Dropbox and Yammer stand out as serious culture-building innovators , each cultivating lasting company cultures that have gotten them through their make-or-break years . I 've taken a look to see what 's working and what 's not , as I think there are some valuable takeaways for any organization . <p> Share Ownership . Employees great and small at Zynga ( developers of Farmville and Words With Friends my newest addiction ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CEO Mark Pincus holds them all to the same mantra : " Be your own CEO : Own outcomes . " Zyngas company culture is built on Pincus heavy emphasis on ownership . In an interview , he explainedtoFastCompany that he " wanted to push the ownership and decision making to the people who were closest to the features , problems , and opportunities and empower them to go for it , to take risks and make mistakes . " And this empowerment has seen serious results . Moving at Zynga Speed , Pincus company is poised for great success . <p> Build Trust and Provide Transparency . We all know that trust goes a long way , especially when it comes to building loyalty . Groupon couldnt have made coupons cool again without their people . How did they do it ? Among other things , they trust their team to get the job done . Not surprisingly , their people are personally invested in what they do and genuinely care about their work . " The only recognition we need , " says one employee on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much they loved their Groupon experience . " <p> But Groupon does n't  stop there . Trust is , as they say , a two-way street . " Were big on transparency , and staying close to our roots , what we stand for , as we grow , " said Groupons Head of People Strategy , Dan Jessup said in an interviewwithForbes . " With growth this fast , we have to trust and respect our people and show them that we care and that we are listening . " Dan , I have just one question for you : Where do I sign up ? <p> Hire the Right People and Let Them Do Their Jobs . Hiring the right people for your organization is arguably the most important step in building your company culture , as online storage provider Dropboxs CEO , Drew Houston , can attest . Hiring fewer , but better , people reduced the need for Dropbox founders to be great at coordinating and planning employees every move . As such , they were able to focus on offering a flexible schedule and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Dropbox puts their people in the drivers seat of their careers which , as a Gen Yer , is my favorite style of retention strategy . <p> Nip Entitlement in the Bud . Its no secret that Silicon Valley employees get some outrageous perks . In fact , many Zynga employees may receive significant proceeds from sales of equity in the public markets after Zyngas initial public offering . So much so that Zynga officials are concerned about the impact sudden wealth may have on their employees . But the issue Zynga faces is n't just turnover . Zynga officials fear this may reduce the teams motivation to continue to work " at Zynga Speed , " and its this potential impact on company culture that concerns them most . Perks and incentives are meant to give employees a sense of value , not entitlement , and Zyngas now faced with the challenge of finding a balance moving forward . Does potential wealth become their main motivator ? <p> Nail the Onboarding Process . The culture at Groupon can be a little jarring for newcomers , and in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to hide it . " As we get bigger , instead of being like most companies , conforming and becoming more normal , we want to become weirder . " Fortunately , Mason knows that getting onto the Groupon brainwave is vital to new employees success . To ensure every teammember is drinking the Groupon nectar , Mason involves himself in the onboarding process , he meets with a group of new employees off site every two weeks , provides an overview of the company , and gives them a chance to ask him their burning questions directly . <p> Keep People Connected . One of the biggest challenges any organization faces in growing is keeping people on the same page . Dropbox is no exception . When the team was small enough to fit in one room , communication occurred naturally . But building an organization is no cakewalk , and things have become more difficult now the team is bigger ( remember everyone maintains a different work schedule ) . " As we grew larger , " said CEO Drew Houston , " we had to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info in the right peoples hands . " <p> In order to enhance communication in the workplace and keep employees connected to the company , many businesses are adopting enterprisesocialnetworks such as Yammer . There are certainly kinks to work out ( i.e. communicating the difference between mainstream social networking sites and an intra-organizational communication tool ) , but the move towards a social platform for company communications have proven invaluable for many organizations . <p> And who better to facilitate interoffice communications than Yammer ? After all , information sharing is an integral part of their company culture . In an interview with the New York Times Corner Office , CEO David Sacks says he encourages dissent in his company . " Youve got to constantly ask your reports whether they think were on the right track , " he says , " whether the strategy you 've laid out is right , what they think about the strategy , where things are n't  going well . " As such , he s created a much more dynamic work environment where everything is far more collaborative . <p> While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows come home , even ) , I 'd rather hear from you . What strategies does your company employ to cultivate culture ? How are they leveraging technology to keep you engaged ?

The tools that we use make it much easier to work virtually . Because of this , your co-workers often become nothing more than an on-line persona , " The man behind the curtain , " even if you work in the same office . Choosing the right avatar can lead to many extremely rich interactions via an online tool ; the key is to pick one that enables this to happen . Avatars are very personal for many people ; this can make a discussion about a persons avatar as insulting as telling someone they 're ugly . <p> First , let 's define what an Avatar is. <h> av-+a-+tar <p> av-uh-tahr , - av-uh-tahr- -noun <p> 1 . Hindu- Mythology : the descent of a deity to the earth in an incarnate form or some manifest shape , the incarnation of a god . <p> I see this all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos of hobbies , cartoon characters , etc for their avatar . Hopefully these are people you know , have met , or have some personal connection with so you know what they look like . Otherwise , it can get a little disorienting . Let 's take that into the business context . Especially in a globally distributed company , you may work , even extensively so , with people you have never meet in person . Or perhaps , there are people you see every day , but you just do n't  quite know who they are . There have been times when I collaborated with a colleague online and proceeded to stand next to him / her in the lunch line without knowing who he / she is . These are just some of the opportunities that you may be missing because of your avatar or the lack thereof . <p> Even when you are using a great photo of yourself as an avatar , if it includes your whole body , chances are you are unrecognizable . Most avatars represent themselves in &lt;= 100 pixels . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> here 's an example : <p> Guidelines for a good avatar : <p> Try to make your face the focus <p> Fill most of the frame with your face <p> Smile <p> Be yourself <p> Avoid Sunglasses <p> Avoid hats that cast shadows over your face <p> Avoid shots where you 're looking into the sun <p> Crop High Resolution shots to get the best quality possible <p> Many sites will automatically crop/resize your image . I 'd recommend starting with a large image . In the event that your image is n't acceptable or may not be exactly how you like it , there are sites that can help you and crop based on the specific sites limitations . One of my favorites is : - http : //mypictr.com/ <p> What do I use for my work avatar ? I use this picture that was taken by a former colleague ( @dpanyikdale ) . - Its not very exciting ( some might even say a little " corporate " ) , but it does help me get recognized when I 'm in the office . <p> I expect that most people wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and that 's perfectly understandable . Another alternative is to use your avatar to show yourself in a more natural environment , having fun . More important than the background , is to ensure that you are recognized . Here is another avatar I use on Twitter that is a little less " corporate . " <p> By having an easily recognizable avatar , you stand a better chance of taking advantage of face-2-face encounters , which can more often lead to deeper discussions and other business opportunities . Not only that , but people who consume your content ( and or your collaborators ) tend to take your content more seriously when there 's a real human on the other end of the message . This happens because the image of your face portrays a sense of accountability . <p> Are there other tips Ive forgotten ? Share them with everyone so we can all learn .

Try a YamJam ! <p> By the Yammer team , on July 19 , 2010May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> This is a guest post written by Austen Hunter , Head of Transport Operations at Brighton &amp; Hove City Council ( BHCC ) . He is currently responsible for the traffic control center , traffic signals design , real time passenger information systems , among other things . Austen has been instrumental in growing the BHCC Yammer network . <p> I work in a UK local government transport department and have no background in IT or Communications . I do n't  even have a social media account with Facebook , Twitter or any other social network , except Yammer , which I joined four months ago . I wanted to try a " YamJam " to discuss an important business priority with a broad range of colleagues and to help promote better use of the network . A YamJam is a focused online discussion , using Yammer , where a group of people get together at the same time to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many different formats . This is how we chose to approach our first one . <p> To prepare for our " YamJam " , I read-up on as many tips as I could find from others experience with this sort of event ( special thanks to Ed Krebs ! ) . - I chose a subject that I 'm passionate about and one that is relevant to a wide range of colleagues . I gave plenty of advance notice , made a list of all the key interested parties and possible senior sponsors . I sent invites to all those contacts , including our CEO , and kept track of who accepted and who converted acceptance into joining the specific group area on our Yammer network . This helped me to identify those who wanted to join in but might need help to access the network . <p> We placed an advert on our intranet site one week prior to the event and I sent follow up e-mails to the key people directly , not just as a reminder but also to address objections that I 'd picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time " , so I explained that one of the great things about the format is that you can view and contribute at anytime , before or after the main event . <p> I posted eight suggestion questions in separate posts and invited people to " vote " by using the like button , or to add their own . We ended up with 22 suggestions . I think that this helped some people to engage with the topic and the media in advance . <p> On the day of the event , I split the 22 questions into what , why , who and how categories and chose the most popular in each category to put forward . I also added a feedback question to finish on to see what people thought of the YamJam . We actually used six questions , but four would have been enough for one hour . <p> To break the ice , I asked people to introduce themselves and their interest in the topic at the beginning of the session . Thinking through the categories of the questions and how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural flow from one question to the next . At one point , we had people answering three questions at once , which was fine . <p> We made it clear that nobody was " on the panel . " In other words , anyone was free to jump in and respond to the questions . Having said that , the input from our expert facilitator was invaluable and enabled me to focus more on timing and keeping the discussion moving . <p> As a result , nine percent of our networks members provided contributions , and if you apply the 90-9-1 rule , we reckon that , in total , 90 percent would have viewed the discussion , without the need to organise and pay for everyone to travel to a single venue . We received 30 times the number of posts that we normally receive on an average day all focused on a valuable business priority . Its hard to quantify how many new members were added to the network as a direct result of the event , but what we do know is that overall , membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YamJam as an idea was initially floated ( six weeks ago ) and the actual event taking place . During that time , our CEO has also joined the network . <p> Next time , I would focus even more effort on making sure that people feel comfortable with the media . I would also try to find advocates in different parts of the organisation to help increase engagement and share the workload of promoting the event . Clear senior level sponsorship would be great as would more exposure on the intranet . I would gather even more advance feedback and address any concerns . I would also do more to encourage everyone to have a voice and feel comfortable expressing their views and posing questions . Relating the questions to practical , real life examples or case studies could also help people to better connect . <p> All in all , the session exceeded my expectations . Colleagues have already been asking whether there will be more of these events , and it has given me lots of ideas for future topics . I sincerely hope that others will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a YamJam of their own ! @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024741 @624741/ <p> During the keynote at NetSuites SuiteWorld conference last week ( see- here for details surrounding our presence there ) , - I heard a statistic that really resonated with me : business data doubles every 1.2 years . While I 've heard several versions of this statistic that vary by some margin of error , that 's not the point . The point is that there 's a lot more data today than ever before , and we are creating this data at an increasing rate . We are drowning in data , and not only are there more messages per channel , there are also more channels getting added daily . We face a deluge of data in personal and professional lives . Aided by the - consumerization of business apps , - we consume activity and information streams , following things , places and events . Tools and platforms emerge that aggregate , tie together and filter . <p> As Clay Shirky aptly points out , its not information overload ; its filter failure that 's the problem . The better you can separate signal from noise , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal life . My post on Cultural Imperative for a Social Business drew out a really smart comment from Herve Tourpe on our internal customer community . " Power also derives from the capacity to deal effectively with information overload , " said Herve . I- think that 's a great way of thinking about filter management in the context of modern leadership . <p> Let 's talk about filtering as a solution to the problem of information overload . Before data ever becomes information , it has to be delivered to your brain , processed and either filed or acted upon . I believe there are 3 types of filters that help you deliver the right data points to your brain : <p> 1 ) - - Machine filtering . Of course , you want your communication platforms to get to know you and serve you relevant data automatically , to be converted into information . The platform gets to know your historical behavior , your interest graph , and interest graphs of people with whom you have ties of varying intensity ( from tight to loose ) . Ill address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - - Manual filtering : No automated filter will ever know you 100% ; - you as a consumer of information are also responsible for managing your own data flow . Part of it will require you to get to know and adjust machine filters . But even more importantly , you should be proactively managing which platforms you participate in , which feeds you read and send aggregate , and which people and events you follow . <p> 3 ) - - Helping others filter : This is the more vague of the three , because it has to do with community etiquette . Basically , if you are posting content to a public place where others can read it , make sure it will be relevant to the community that " lives " in that place . Let 's be honest , we all have a message we want to share , and there 's nothing wrong with making sure that your message is seen by the right people . But when posting to a community or group , or mentioning a popular hashtag , please make sure its relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help other community members manage their noise , and they will thank you for it . <p> Since each of the above points can easily be its own blogpost , I 'll plan on writing 1 and 3 separately . In this post , I 'd like to focus on point #2 more closely . Without further ado , here are some simple tips on adjusting your own filters . <p> Choose people you follow carefully . <p> This applies equally to internal and external social networking . On Yammer , as well as on Twitter , you can and should follow the people whom you find interesting and relevant . That being said , if you are a marketer , do n't  feel compelled to follow only marketers . There 's an amazing serendipity that happens when people with different experiences , backgrounds and worldviews work together . Make sure the selection of people you are following is relevant to you , while inspiring you to think outside of the box . I 'm embedding Steven Johnsons TED talk on where good ideas come from ; it underscores this point perfectly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing wrong with adjusting things and people you follow from time to time . In an internal networking scenario , you may move departments or change job positions. - In an external networking scenario , you may have transitioned to a different industry , moved to a different city , and your personal situation may have changed . Stimuli that are interesting to you may ( and should ) change over time . Do n't  feel bad " pruning " ; as much as machine intelligence is here to help you , the ultimate control of how you manage information falls to you . <p> Strive for more relevance . <p> Sometimes I like " drinking from the firehose " by flipping over to " Company View " in Yammer and reading my entire feed on Twitter . This is tremendously fun and enlightening but gets overwhelming quickly ; its not sustainable in the long-term . Thus , there 's a tremendous value in having a laser focus on content that 's relevant to you , even if that relevance is situational or temporal . To that end , I advise using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Twitter you can create lists . Not only do groups narrow your focus , helping you track and participate in more conversations , but they also help you meet people . Imagine if you are new to your Yammer network ; you probably want to follow and become followed by like-minded people . But who are they and how do you find them ? Joining and participating in a group is a great first step ! <p> Birds of a feather flock together . <p> Groups help batch participants and information they exchange , and tend to have a longer-term orientation . There are also ways to unite people and information with a shorter-term mindset . In an internal collaboration scenario , ad-hoc workgroups come together to work on something specific and then disband . At Yammer , we encourage the use of topics , which can be attached to each thread ; thus threads can be batched together for easy tracking and lookup . The Twitter equivalent of a topic is a hashtag , which also serves to batch together all tweets marked with a # symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a topic in Yammer by posting a keyword with a # sign right in front of it ) . <p> Allow for serendipity . <p> Focusing on topics and hashtags , putting conversations into groups are all great ways to ensure that you can focus on signal vs. noise . It also allows you to get your message in front of the most relevant people . But remember to step outside of your world every once in a while and allow for some cross-functional , cross-cultural and cross-awesome serendipity . <p> I 'd like to turn it over to you for comments . Please share in the comments what filtering mechanisms work for you !

What do I do if an employee says my CEO grinds small childrens bones to make his bread ?

Recognize patterns over time and create your own list of FAQs ; direct people there . <p> Keep the house in order : <p> Maria:While you have to establish a solid usage policy that aligns everyone without too much constraint , you also get the distinct pleasure of enforcing the policy. - - The community manager knows where the line is , and is empowered to do both : take action on minor infractions and escalate the major ones to the right departments to take disciplinary action . Outside of infractions , the community manager should take action to ensure that the general mood of the community is productive and constructive by a continued focus on things to do vs. things not to do . <p> Have some fun ! <p> Kate : If a community manager is always business focused and unquestionably right , employees will feel they , too , must be perfect . - - Bring business value , but also ask an obvious question , do n't  delete your typos , and make a lame pun ! <p> Maria : Your community is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborate if they do n't  feel want to be there .

@@12024747 @624747/ <p> There are many reasons that businesses today might choose to invest in their technology and adopt new digital solutions . However , underlying core business requirements , there is usually a need for some form of change . Companies always start the conversation with " something could change to improve X , " or " something has to change to overcome Y. " Its easy to be fooled by the pop culture idiom , build it and they will come , but the reality is that people do n't  like change , and this extends to changing internal enterprise tools and processes . Organizations quickly realize that building an exceptional digital solution is only half the battle , and the other half is getting employees to embrace this change and adopt new processes , systems or values . <p> Last year BrightStarr worked with the Rugby Foootball Union ( RFU ) , the governing body of rugby in England , on a new and transformational SharePoint Intranet that had some lofty goals and would change the way the organization collaborated . The RFU has a 550-strong workforce helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way through to the professional level . In their efforts to grow rugby in England they run competitions , help to develop coaching and support some of the worlds largest rugby tournaments such as the Rugby World Cup . Headquartered in the 82,000-seater Twickenham Stadium with a large team operating from geographically dispersed locations around the country , they needed a new robust platform that would bring colleagues , information and resources together in a single digital location . <p> The RFUs new Intranet was focused on three key functions that would support their work : delivering essential news and information across the organization , empowering staff with a brand new people directory and building effective communities within the organization . SharePoint 2013 offered a wealth of functionality that enabled the RFU to realize these goals for their new Intranet , but they wanted much more than a static solution . The RFU recognized a huge opportunity to create a truly innovative digital solution , which would support staff collaboration and team communication in new ways through a custom integration of Yammer across their Intranet . <p> Yammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the RFU , which in turn reflects the culture of the sport they represent : teamwork , respect , enjoyment , discipline and sportsmanship . By integrating Yammer with SharePoint , the RFU was able to surface real-time conversations and information alongside the more static Intranet functionality , which brought the solution to life and made collaborating easier than ever before . Yammer groups within the RFU are not only used to discuss topics such as office services and company social events , but also extend to the sport itself , like the Young Rugby Ambassador programme and the Rugby World Cup in 2015 . The RFUs internal communities now have a new way to connect and engage , and this ability for staff to directly contribute to discussions and to support one another has led to high user adoption of the new solution . <p> The go-live point of any Intranet project is a significant moment for both the project team and the employees of the organization as all interest groups want to see success . The great thing about featuring Yammer in the Intranet is that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to having working conversations , only now they are faster and better than ever before . The moment the Intranet goes live , staff can engage , share and get to grips with their new tool together . <p> RFUs new Intranet , " RFU Connected , " has been described as " a step change " to their internal digital tools , building their internal team culture , improving efficiency and increasing employee engagement within the organization ( and it looks great to boot ) . The project represented a significant change for the RFU , since it not only connected disparate staff and provided new tools , but it also incorporated new methods of developing , learning and sharing best practices . Through the combination of robust SharePoint features and the highly engaging Yammer platform , they were able to support staff in not only engaging with this change but also being excited about it . <p> To find out more about this project , watch our executive video case study below ! @qwx171301 @qwx171306

Its our goal to create a platform that enables a uniform social experience across the applications people use every day at work . Yammer connects people to one another and to the information they need to get work done whether this content is a document note created inside Yammer , or something shared from an external business app . <p> While we continue to create deeper connected experiences across Microsoft products , we are also committed to expanding our partner ecosystem to include all enterprise apps. - In fact , we 've doubled the number of partner integrations to 60 since we launched the Yammer App Directory in October 2012 . Were excited to highlight some of our newest integration partners , including Klout , which we are introducing today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Yammer user , you can publish your public Klout- score and expertise directly on your Yammer profile . If you 're someone who has a lot of influence in the public social-sphere , this is a cool way to showcase your Klout score in the workplace . The second aspect of integration allows Yammer admins to turn on a deeper integration with Klout to produce Yammer-specific Klout scores for employees based on their activity within their companys Yammer network . This is a great opportunity for organizations to identify top contributors and subject matter experts based on their Yammer participation. - Check out Klouts blog post to learn more . <p> In the past few months , Yammer has also added integrations with 7Geese , a social performance management tool , and Scoop.it , a content curation platform . From the business intelligence side , Yammer partner GoodData introduced a new and improved integration in conjunction with sentiment analysis provider Kanjoya . The updated integration combines operational reporting and sentiment analysis in the same dashboard , providing full context on the structured and unstructured data from your Yammer networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure the ROI of their technology investments , and this integration offers a unique way to measure the impact of Yammer conversations . <p> Just as the volume of Yammer partners has increased , so has the adoption of and activity on these apps . The frequency of transactions between Yammer and partner apps , measured through API requests , has increased significantly . Compared to year-to-date numbers last year , API requests have increased 180 percent and are on pace to grow 300 percent by the end of the calendar year . <p> Given the power and flexibility of Yammers open APIs , its no surprise that partners continue to reap the benefits of their integrations with Yammer . Mindflash , the online training platform who partnered with us last summer , has seen a significant jump in free trials since joining the Yammer App Directory . Mindflash is benefitting from the exposure their app gets on Yammer as they can target companies who are embracing technology within their organizations in fact , Yammer is one of their top sources of trials . <p> Were even broadening our partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners Axceler and Nintex have already developed integrations for Yammer , and we expect this trend to continue moving forward . The established SharePoint Partner ecosystem of over two thousand partners is embracing the app model , which is reflected within the SharePoint Store . <p> Coming this November , Yammer is launching a Developers Certification program , which will feature self-paced training , community groups , webinars , and a certification exam that develops the advanced skills necessary to be called a Yammer Certified Developer . Its the latest addition to the certifications offered by Yammer Education Services . Needless to say , its an exciting time to partner with Yammer . There are more than 12,000 developers using our open APIs to create deeply social experiences for business users to make companies more open , connected and productive . Were looking forward to watching this ecosystem grow even more .

@@12024751 @624751/ <h> Loving the Like ' Button <p> By the Yammer team , on August 8 , 2013June 28 , 2017 0Shares <p> Any social network user will tell you , the more " Likes " your post gets , the better . But in practice , Ive seen that a " Like " can mean more than simply liking what an update has to say . As an avid user of the " Like " button , I was curious to learn more about how other people use it on Yammer . So last week , I created a survey and posted it to the Yammer Customer Network ( YCN ) . The feedback was lively , and the results indicated that Yammer users intuitively choose the " Like " button to quickly convey a variety of messages . <p> As it turns out , there are many different uses of a " Like , " and each has a direct benefit to you and your network . I 've broken down the major examples as ranked below , and encourage you to try using " Like " in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show your approval , appreciation , or agreement . <p> 95% of the users surveyed hit " Like " when they genuinely like someones post . Clicking the " Like " button is an efficient and easy way to participate when you 're busy , as Workflow Expert Lori Koncz explains , " Like is acceptance , appreciation , and applause all in one click . " This can be particularly powerful when a leader uses " Like " to show that they are engaged with their employees and recognize contributions across their organization . <p> 2 . " Like " messages that you 've been @mentioned or ccd on to notify the poster that you 've have seen the message . <p> This creates a quick feedback loop , without a string of emails that just say , " Got it " or " Youre welcome . " <p> 3 . " Like " new users posts for positive reinforcement . <p> Lisa Vanderlip , Communications Specialist for the Canadian Cancer Society , told us , " As my networks community manager , I encourage Likes as they let the poster know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posting and then all you hear is crickets nothing . " " Likes " are one of the best ways to boost employee engagement in a new network and build momentum during a network or a group launch . <p> 4 . As a new user , " Like " posts to get your feet wet . <p> " Likes " are a low-stakes way for new users to get comfortable with working out loud . And , by liking coworkers posts , these shy users are building connections with others and supporting their network . <p> 5 . " Like " to recognize useful content outside of your immediate team or division . <p> Yammer encourages us to work out in the open , and the " Like " button is a simple way for colleagues to show appreciation for useful content , discussions , and collaborative effort across the organization . Being " Liked " shows that people outside your own immediate team care about what you are working on . <p> How to " Like " a message you dislike . <p> Sometimes there 's just a negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " may feel inappropriate , but its important to show you 're engaged . Speaking from personal experience , I believe most people understand that your " Like " conveys support and acknowledgment , not that you 're actually pleased that your coworker is " sick as a dog . " If you 're still concerned that clicking " Like " will send the wrong message , you can " Like " someone elses uplifting response in the thread , or simply write a personal reply of your own conveying how you feel about this topic or issue . <p> Regardless of how you use " Like , " share your personal experiences with us in the comments below ! If you 're interesting in starting a discussion in your network about the different and creative ways people use " Like , " please reach out to me for details on the survey I posted to the YCN. @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024753 @624753/ <h> How To Drive Social Adoption Throughout Your Business <p> By the Yammer team , on May 29 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Enterprise Social Networking has become quite a hot topic across many blogs , news sites and conferences . When done right , an ESN can catapult a business into a collaborative success . However , when it fails to meet business goals , it is sees as " nice to have " . To that end , I conducted a- video interview Mycustomer.com , in which- I covered a number of different points relating to the popularity of Enterprise Social Networks , how to identify and measure the value and making the change stick within your organisation . I 've summarised some of the key points below . <p> How are your ESN initiatives doing against some of these critical success factors ? <h> Why is there so much demand ? <p> Weve seen a huge take-up in Yammers service which is indicative of a strong demand , recently topping 5MM people registered via www.yammer.com . <p> One of the main reasons we think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference at work , and this often requires them to make connections within the organisation that they might not be able to with the current information systems they have . <p> Whether its finding a document that theyd otherwise spend a week re-writing or connecting with someone that has the expertise they seek , ESN tools such as Yammer provide a way of making the resources of the organisation available to you when you need it . <p> We see our customers benefiting from this capability in a huge number of different ways , from enabling their sales teams to deliver faster , providing better customer service or on-boarding new employees faster . <p> This level of connectedness is also essential for businesses that need to adapt to a world where the rate of change is only ever increasing . Without being able to effectively marshal the resources at their disposal , organisations will find adaptation to be a challenge without tools such as ESN to provide these connections . <h> Who is driving the take up ? <p> We see a wide range of stakeholders involved in ESN initiatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders who are at the table in the majority of cases : <p> The CIO is a key stakeholder in any ESN initiative . They will almost always have responsibility for the overall management of the service from a technical point of view and ensuring that it meets the relevant standards of the IT organisation . Tools like Yammer are also a fantastic way of CIOs being able to demonstrate quick time to value and delivery of services that enable the business . <p> The HR Director has a key role to play in terms of formulation of policies and governance for the use of the ESN capability , much as they did during the introduction of email and other forms of communication . As employee engagement is generally part of the HR remit there is also a direct HR benefit to the delivery of ESN as it is a great way of measuring and improving employee engagement . <p> The Communications Director is very often part of the core ESN team . Recognising that the introduction of ESN represents a shift from one-way communication to a discussion with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to the Internal Communications organisation and a source of real benefit for them . <h> How do I find the value ? <p> ESN is a capability which gives your organisation the ability to more effectively draw on the people and resources it has . Given this , there are a wide number of areas where business value can be obtained . We advocate the following process : <p> Analyse bottom-up : For those with existing free Yammer networks , the process for identifying value areas can be accelerated by analysing what is already happening . Often those who realise the potential value of the platform will gravitate towards it and will be demonstrating some behaviours that can be amplified or adapted for maximum business effect <p> Filter through a top down view : Review what your organisation is looking to achieve strategically and marry the capability that Yammer provides to that . This will help demonstrate relevance to those who are most focused on company strategy . What we often find is that there are already activities that are going on within the Yammer network that directly support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether more value can be delivered <h> How do I measure the value ? <p> Given the breadth of potential benefits , there are a correspondingly wide set of measures which could be applied . Fortunately , the measures which often make the most sense are those which are already used within the organisation ( such as sales metrics or employee engagement scores ) . <p> When measuring the value , our key advice would be to focus on the effect ( e.g. the business result ) rather than the cause ( simply measuring uptake of a platform ) , as this will allow you then demonstrate value in terms that the business understands . <p> While core metrics such as uptake are important , having X people using a platform does n't  mean that it is generating value for an organisation if it did , then you could make a very reasonable case for installing bars in your offices ! <p> Support your adoption metrics by also considering real business measures for example , how many deals did your sales team do that made use of the ESN capability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by how much ) as a result of the connections made via the ESN ? <h> How do I make the change stick ? <p> As with any new capability , adapting an organisation to make the most use of Yammer will take time , particularly if the organisations culture is not one that is conducive towards sharing of information and team working . There are a few critical success factors that we have seen work consistently at our customers , which are : <p> Pick things that matter : Focus on processes that are core to how your organisation operates and explain how the capability Yammer provides can be directly relevant to making them more effective <p> Gain executive sponsorship based on a business case that has been created around these core processes , and ensure that this sponsorship translates into active participation by the executives involved <p> Communicate relevance rather than technology : Do n't  treat this as a technology project but instead communicate to people why this is relevant to their day to day work and does n't  add time to it . Put all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour your ability to deliver business value will be limited <p> Remove any technical barriers : Choose a platform that reduces the number of technical barriers to adopting the change in behaviour . If people have to think too hard about what button to press , they are unlikely to adapt to the new way of working . <p> Put it where people work : Integrate the capability both into the business process and the tools people use every day . Technology like Yammer Embed can help hugely with this and has been shown to dramatically increase adoption , as the barrier to contribution is significantly reduced <p> Here at Yammer , the Customer Success team are always on hand to help you make your journey to ESN adoption a comfortable one .

Its also not always easy to persuade people to adopt new methods for working or to even try new technology . We understand taking that first step towards socializing the way you work with your team can be difficult . Luckily , with the help of our customers , we 've compiled a list of best tips to help you and your company understand how to get the most out of social . <p> 1 . Work out loud <p> If you 're brand new to Yammer and want to set the example for others in your network , try working out loud . What do we mean by working out loud ? Share woking drafts of your documents and ask for feedback from peers . By sharing projects as you work on them , you 'll find more opportunities for collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final product will be . <p> 2 . Invite colleagues from your team and other departments <p> Loop your colleagues into the conversation by inviting them to join your network . Set up a Yammer Group for your team , share notes from meetings , collect comments on documents , and provide updates on your projects . At your next team meeting , take the opportunity to do a Yammer 101 overview to help them get started . Use the group to manage team projects to get everyone involved . <p> 3 . Connect with other active members and create a community of peers <p> Its said that threes a crowd . Well , we believe you should connect with as many peers as you can find . Share ideas with one another and set a strategy to help others embrace this new way of working . By reaching out to others who are active Yammer users , you will find an untapped pool of success stories and a group of like-minded individuals who are working towards the same goal as you . <p> 4 . Recruit an Executive <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are hesitant about trying new technology at work and can even champion the initiative . Find an executive who is particularly passionate about driving change in the organization or social tools in general . Provide your sponsor with regular updates on your progress , the value you 've gained , and any challenges you are facing . <p> Simon Terry , CEO HICAPS at National Australia Bank found that the best way to engage executives was by discussing relevant topics on Yammer and inviting them to join the conversation . Help your executives get started by coaching them to understand the following key points : <p> Get your messages out , but make it a two-way dialogue : - Yammer allows leaders to reach people at all levels of the organization and engage them in a two-way conversation . It gives executives a chance to clarify strategies , get updates on the initiatives , and become aware of customer feedback . <p> Discover the potential of your employees : Social media gives people a forum to share their knowledge and allows others to uncover unknown talents in their coworkers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock to discuss your post . Your title or reputation may be intimidating . Yammer offers a way to connect with those you may not regularly interact with , but you may have to give people time to warm up to you . <p> 5 . Highlight successes <p> There is power in recognizing the success of others . A great way to easily find accomplishments is to encourage your team members to hashtag valuable conversations with #yamwin . This makes it seamless to showcase successes in the future . <p> Jennifer Thorimbert , Enterprise Community Manager at The Walt Disney Company said that for her early adopters , quickly showing triumphsno matter how big or smallwas key to ensuring Disneys Yammer network continued to grow and to stay relevant after the initial launch . <p> Whether you 're at a startup or a Fortune 500 company , its time to embrace social as the future of business .

@@12024756 @624756/ <h> Enterprise Social Networks Exactly What Has Changed ? <p> By the Yammer team , on May 9 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Enterprise Social Networking ( ESN ) has been around since 2007 . We 've talked a lot about success and have even reached mainstream adoption in many large companies . What made me curious was : - exactly what has changed ? As I started to look at this , it struck me that ESNs are communication platforms . So how have communications changed because of this ? <h> The reigning champ <p> Email has been around for over 20 years ( for - history of email , see Enterprise 2.0 You ca n't win or lose in the first inning ) , but only recently have we started to realize the strengths and , more importantly , the weaknesses of having everything in ones Inbox . Far too many of us get too much email to remain effective , and comments like- " email overload " and " email bankruptcy " are testament to this fact . We rely on the sender to read our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we still find that there are many things we need to know about but we dont. - Additionally , Marketing folks realized that many of us spend a lot of time in our inboxes and have started to use email to send unsolicited marketing newsletters ( and sometimes SPAM ! ) , placing more demands on our time and causing further frustation . <p> While email has given us one place to find information , thanks to mobile apps , the downside of email is that its a " closed system . " This means that only the people that are explicitly included in the email thread know about it . There is a lot of information captured in our inboxes that is n't necessarily private or confidential that may in fact be better utilized if shared . In fact , most of us classify the information that we process on a daily basis as being uninteresting or unimportant to others . The reality is that we are really bad judges of how important information is to others , yet email requires us to assume this role despite us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim OReilly popularized the term Web 2.0 and Andrew McAfee applied that to enterprises with Enterprise 2.0 , there 's been a lot of buzz and discussion on how " it changes the way companies do business . " By opening up conversations and sharing information previously trapped in inboxes , people who need to know information have access to it . This fundamentally shifts curation of content from the publisher to the consumer of the information . <p> This concept of shifting from " push " to " pull " is n't really new , and has been the topic of many Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0 discussions , presentations and blogs . But , as we apply this shift inside of our companies , let 's examine the dynamics in play that cause friction if not managed properly . <h> The Hierarchy <p> For most of us reading this , the hierarchy is n't anything new . At the top of the heap is the CEO who generally has Vice Presidents reporting to him/her , who in turn have Directors reporting to them and so on . In this model , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with promotion as the reward for being in control . At the top level , the CEO has the broadest scope , but possibly the least depth on any given topic . As you get deeper into the organization , the scope decreases and the depth of understanding increases . <p> Communications are typically managed through interactions with direct reports . At each level of the hierarchy , the leader interprets &amp; filters based on what they believe to be their organizational priorities . By doing this , each leader can ensure that his / her organizational needs and priorities are being met . This does n't  just work on information cascading down from the top ; it works similarly with information coming from the bottom . <p> Filtering information coming from knowledge workers has enabled leaders to keep a broad view on all of the things within their scope without having to know all the details . One side effect of this filtering is the tendency to spin : spin bad news to avoid blame , and spin good news to attribute success to themselves . While this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside companies . <h> Middle Management Squeeze <p> Enterprise Social Networks have tipped the corporate apple cart . We 've now made it so that knowledge workers get the message directly from the CEO and other executives , and have visibility into what 's going on with other groups without relying on their management team . On the other hand , these executives now have much greater visibility into the details of what 's really happening inside their company ; this has made it much more difficult for people to hide the missteps and challenges inside of their organizations . <p> What 's really changed is the role of middle management inside of organizations , but nobody bothered to tell them this or prepare them for the change . If we do n't  address the changes with them , this very powerful group of people will seek to undermine the change and regain control . While many executives may downplay the importance of middle management , these folks can impact the success of transformational technologies through tactics such as : subtle intimidation , outright defiance &amp; blatant " That 's not how we do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by proactively helping middle management understand the shift in their roles and how they can leverage emergent technologies to be successful , you can gain powerful allies , due to their breadth of experience . <h> The evolving role of middle management <p> What exactly is this new role ? While it varies , it usually has the following components : <p> Interpret Help your team understand how what the CEO says impacts their organization . <p> Plan Clearly define the priorities for the team and ensure that these priorities are being met . <p> Focus Help your team keep focused on the business priorities of the organization , despite all of these new inputs . <p> Teach Help your team learn from mistakes and avoid making the same one twice . <p> Lead Demonstrate to your team the value of transparency and recognize when your team is practicing desired behaviors . <h> The right tool for the right job <p> Its important to remember that despite this openness , not everything belongs in an ESN . Individual criticism , earnings and other sensitive areas should be kept in channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask yourself : " Does this need to be private ?

Of those results , many refer to business events , such as Disrupt SF by TechCrunch , and educational tools to empower your business to beat the competition . However , what separates this educational post from the others is that the true meaning of " disrupt " is defined with three actionable ways for business leaders to upset the competition . <p> First , let 's define " disrupt . " According to Bing Dictionary " disrupt " has two distinct meanings : <p> " Interrupt : to interrupt the usual course of a process or activity " <p> " Destroy order : to destroy the order or orderly progression of something . " <p> Applying this definition to business , disrupting the competition in the coming year requires two things from your company . One , business leaders must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely internal communication and organizational structure . Two , business disruption requires your company to destroy the order of preference in your customers minds if a competitor is top-of-mind currently . <p> Here are three ways to help you smartly interrupt the status-quo processes within your company that are n't  working , and capture the preference of your customers purchasing decisions . <p> 1 . Re-think and experiment with new internal communication processes . <p> Adam Pisoni , co-founder and CTO of Yammer , suggests business leaders reimagine their traditional hierarchical structures as networks of people communicating to get things done . For example , he recommends the following action : <p> " I think were only beginning to explore the balance between hierarchies and networks . In truth well probably need both . Networks of hierarchies and hierarchies of networks . To understand where the hierarchy is failing , look for places where change is particularly difficult , or where people seem unhappy doing what they 're supposed to do . Or where people are having lots of meetings . Meetings are usually a reflection of a broken hierarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inform other groups , or ask other groups to do things for you . These are areas where working as a network negates the need for as many meetings . " <p> Obviously companies need traditional technology to communicate , project manage and complete tasks , such as email and Office Suite products . However , many organizations , in fact , 85 percent of Fortune 500 companies , are implementing Enterprise Social Networks as a way to encourage employee engagement , innovation and collaboration . Last year , the Yammer Blog produced " Steps to Cultivating Employee Engagement . " These steps still ring true as a valuable resource for business leaders . The following steps show how to cultivate employee engagement with social technology : <p> " A visionary leader turns vision into reality by creating a vivid image of the target they need to attain and creating a specific strategic plan for the coming year , " suggests Forbes contributor , Dave Lavinsky , in " Are You a Visionary Business Leader ?

Today , well discuss how enterprise social networking is transforming sales and marketing in pharma companies and look ahead to what 's next for ESN in big pharma . <p> Selling Pharmaceuticals Sales and Marketing <p> Selling drugs in the pharmaceutical industry is no longer just about how your product or technology competes or how the product is priced . The emphasis is now on the patient . A recent Mayo clinic research report found that " Expenditures on prescription drugs reached $250 billion in 2009 , and accounted for 12 percent of total personal health care expenditures . " Patient relationships with their medicine , how medicine improves their quality of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important factors in the marketplace . This has led some pharmaceutical companies to start using enterprise social networking externally to open up dialogues with patients and customers , enabling them to respond more quickly to feedback as they explore new markets and try new approaches to treating disease and illness . <p> One sector of big pharma in particular interacts with patients more than others : the Consumer Health Care ( CHC ) sector . One large privately held global pharmaceutical company employed an innovative use case on the over-the-counter marketing front . Retail employees posted photos of product displays in pharmacies from across the globe in their Yammer network . For example , in France , a cold medication display with stuffed animals was posted on Yammer so that others in the global network could see the success of that specific marketing implementation . Employees could see what was resonating with customers and replicate the best visual merchandising across stores , attracting more customers to the stand . <p> Enterprise social networking is also used to educate and support sales reps who spend a large majority of their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reps are able to access information easily and ask their fellow reps questions . This means that they have the most up-to-date information and expertise at their fingertips , even on the go . There is also a cultural benefit as well : people who typically might be working alone in the field are now connected to the larger organization in real time . <p> What 's next for ESN and Big Pharma ? <p> Were just beginning to see the positive impact of enterprise social networking on the pharmaceutical industry , particularly in R&amp;D , operations &amp; manufacturing and sales . Companies that have started to invest in and implement enterprise social networking will see even more business benefits as their networks continue to grow internally , externally , and globally . We are very encouraged by our discussions with pharmas currently using Yammer that this trend will continue. - " Yammer has helped employees gain exposure to other regional and global teams , share best practices and save countless hours by delivering valuable content in a way that is far more efficient than mass email threads , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affairs at Sanofi US .

These natural divisions help us share portions of our lives with the right set of people , and in turn consume portions of their lives . Similarly , our activities and conversations at work are also divided into distinct areas by projects , teams , - initiatives or general interests . Finding the most effective way to share relevant information with the right groups of people can be daunting . Yammer Groups provide a natural platform that allow you to share , learn and collaborate with the right colleagues in just a few basic steps . A Yammer Group that is created with a specific purpose , goals and objectives , is extremely effective in helping you and your team stay connected . <h> Before you create a group <p> Before you dive in and create your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed the right course of action. - Browsing through your Groups Directory will bring light to which groups already exist on the network , helping avoid group dilution and confusion , caused by creation of repetitive groups . Once you 've verified the need for your group , there are still a couple more points to consider. - The Social What has laid out three great questions to ask before creating your group : <h> Creating your group <p> Once you 're ready to set up a group , the actual group creation is a cinch . Along the left hand side of your Yammer home screen , you will see a plus sign with a " create group " - option . <p> The next step is to determine the settings and group information : <h> Choose the owner and administrator <p> In a premium network , the person who creates a group is automatically the group administrator and " owner " of the group . To ensure you have the right person administering your group , it is important to understand what being a Group Administrator involves . Nicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shared her thoughts on what it means to be a group administrator : <p> Determining basic group settings ( as laid out below ) <p> If you specify the option Require new members to be approved by me the admin must need approve or deny requests to join the group . <p> Make new members feel welcome and encourage group engagement <p> Moderate conversations if required <p> Provide basic Yammer support to the group and escalate to Network Administrator if required <p> Manage document storage <p> Mine the conversations for useful information and knowledge , pass them onto relevant people <p> Cross-pollinate conversations into other groups when appropriate <p> Add topics ( tag , keyword ) to a conversation without topics , so it can be more easily retried/found <p> Provide group statistics depending on the type of group you have set up <p> Move , close or archive the group when it has lived its life <p> Pages can easily be used to upload meeting minutes , action items , and agendas . <h> Determine Group Settings <p> Internal Group or External Network An Internal Group is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An External Network is a separate network built off of your " home " Yammer network its usually used to collaborate and connect with those outside of your company . <p> Name and description Make sure the name of your group is clear enough so those searching can find the group on the network . The description should provide more insight into the groups purpose and goals . Make sure to use the Info tab to share more information about the group , its purpose and processes , outline member responsibilites and highlight the type of person that should join the group . <p> Public or Private status A public group is open and available for all members of your Yammer network to join . Public groups are perfect for projects and initiatives that require cross-functional collaboration throughout the organization . Public groups also allow- all interested employees to discover content within the group and use it in their own work . A public group can have open or restricted membership . Anyone can join a public open group and have its updates deliver to his / her Yammer feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this content will not deliver to peoples feeds ; membership in this type of group must be approved by the group admin . <p> Private groups are just that : private . Content within a private group is only available to members of the group , which are admitted via the group admin . At Yammer , we highly encourage the use of public groups . Our culture and product was created to make work more transparent , open and sharable in order to- drive business transformation . While a private group can be useful for sensitive information , we urge you to consider public as a default for topics that are not sensitive . If you change your mind later on , Yammer allows for toggling of a group from public to private , and back . <h> Invite people <p> If you invite the right people , they will invite others , and soon your group will begin growing organically . Make sure you 're inviting members who will have a vested interest in growing the group and contributing meaningfully . <h> Using Groups <h> Set the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals , expectations , purpose and roles of the of the group , from the very beginning . In the info tab of the group , clearly define key goals , roles of various members and deeper information about the groups purpose . You may also want to create a Page , outlining group goals and objectives , and encourage group members to add their suggestions to the page . This will illustrate , through action , that the group is a place for collaborative sharing and co-creation among all members . If the group is centered around a project or initiative , begin uploading relevant files and documents to the group this way , all members will have access to the content they need. - Starting the conversation in a group can be difficult when it is in its infancy . As you invite members to the group , welcome everyone and ask for them to provide a status update to the group . This will encourage participation from the beginning and immediately provide insight into other members activities . <h> Keep the Pulse Alive <p> Maintaining up-to-date content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer group . Do this by utilizing some of the features available for groups , such as these : <p> Pages can easily be used to upload meeting minutes , action items , and agendas . <p> Events can be used to give notice of meetings and important dates . <p> Announcements can be used to broadcast information to the whole group . <p> Encourage group members to share weekly or daily status updates on projects to provide transparency into individuals activities . Weening collegues off of the " reply all " email habit , may be a challenge at first , but understanding- what to post and- where ( tips here ) can certainly help . When you upload information , questions , and files to Yammer , these resources are automatically available for the rest of the organization . This open sharing of information reduces duplication of work and reinforces- serendipitous discovery of content . <p> Mine the group conversations for relevant and insightful conversations to share with other areas of the organization . Cross-pollinate useful information as much as possible ; this allows for other areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <h> Maintaining Healthy Groups <p> In order to maintain the group as a place that members continue to use , some basic management and moderation may be required . Files and content within your Yammer group should be fresh and updated on a regular basis . With Yammer Files , a previously updated file can easily be replaced with the newest version , to ensure access to the most recent information . <p> Inevitably , some groups on Yammer may become stale or may overlap with others in objectives and purpose . However , the content in these groups may still be applicable or useful for the organization . Instead of deleting an entire group and its content , consider working to save the information . One option is to consolidate the relevant files and pages to another active group . In order to keep old group discussions organized and accessible to all , just change the group name and info tab to " Inactive group " . <p> Yammer groups are without a doubt , one of the best ways to solicit many-to-many conversations with your team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thoughtful way , your group can become a highly successful mechanism for managing activities , providing transparency into everyones work and enabling better decision making by- eliminating blindspots. @qwx171301 @qwx171306

Its truly humbling to learn from them and hear their stories from all over the world . Australia and New Zealand has been a strong area of growth for Yammer . One of our notable customers is Deloitte Australia , which consistently produces great content around best practices in internal social and executive alignment . Another cool company from " down under " I had the fortune of " meeting " online via Twitter is GrabOne , a group deals company from New Zealand . I caught up with GrabOnes social media specialist Jen Corbett who was kind enough to share with me how they use Yammer to drive internal communication and productivity . <p> Managing explosive growth <p> GrabOne is growing fast ! Seems like group buying is a worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jen , they are adding 2-3 people each week , and every one of their roughly 70 person staff ( at the time of this writing ) is signed up for Yammer . We can certainly relate to the difficulty of onboarding and integrating new employees , let alone keeping everyone on the same page across several distributed offices . <p> Yammer as part of onboarding <p> How did everyone get signed up ? GrabOne is doing something that we definitely recommend as a best practice : they have added Yammer as part of their onboarding process . When the new employee gets a computer and email , they also get Yammer and Skype . <p> So how did Yammer start at GrabOne ? Well , we 'd have to credit Jen with driving the effort . She first learned about Yammer at Social Media Club , but at that time there werent enough people at the company to really have the service shine . As GrabOne grew , Yammer started to emerge as a solution to its growing pains . <p> What to Yam ? <p> What are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting results of their database queries . For example , they found out what the most popular names are in the database . <p> Sales shares how many coupons were sold . The operations team shares positive feedback , and the HR manager shares inspirational quotes like these : <p> As someone in charge of social media efforts , I can appreciate Jens desire to have the freshest information at her fingertips to give to customers . Yammer helps her figure out when a deal is sold out , or the site is down . Then she can effectively communicate it via social channels , to help customers set expectations . Everyone shares what he or she is working on , and collaboration ensues . <p> Having fun with Yammer <p> GrabOne loves to have fun on Yammer too . For example , Jen launched the April Fools Day initiative earlier this month . She suggested that they do an April Fools joke via Yammer , and everyone threw in ideas . As a result , the winning idea was born : a dolphin harness ride around the bay ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Copywriter wrote and shared copy . The development team made a deal spalshpage . The clever joke even got on national news creating some effective off-the-cuff marketing . In addition to raising awareness , working on this joke together helped everyone have fun and further build culture . <p> What about the other 364 days a year ? GrabOne understands that culture building happens offline and online . Company-wide events , as well as assembling people by hobby , are usually coordinated via Yammer . GrabOne uses groups effectively , allowing thematically and functionally related content to be grouped . When I asked Jen what her favorite feature is that she wants to see further developed , she told me that she 's quite fond of leaderboards . Jen is competitive , and I have a feeling that other GrabOnners will have to fight her for the leader status . @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024764 @624764/ <h> Working Social : Driving Executive Engagement <p> By the Yammer team , on May 16 , 2014May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> The first two posts in this series looked at how to get started and how to create a social strategy based on business goals . Now let 's look at how to sell it into your organization , starting with your executive leadership . <p> At Altimeter , our research found that there usually is n't strong buy-in for the social strategy . Fact : 52% of respondents in our survey believed that their top executives are informed , engaged and aligned with their companys social strategy . Now , you can look at that and say that its pretty good half of corporate executives are bought in . But the counterpoint is that for half of these companies organizations with an active social program the top executives werent aligned with how their customers and employees were engaging with each other in social channels . <p> Can you imagine an executive not knowing or caring about what customers were doing in their stores ? Or how and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? When it comes to social , executives tend to think that it does n't  involve them , that its too trivial or inconsequential for them to focus on . No matter how many of their peers , board members , or direct reports tell them that social matters , they wo n't engage . <p> " What 's In It for Me ? " <p> When I work with executives , there are two major reasons why they are n't  engaged with their social strategy : 1 ) They do n't  understand why social business matters to them personally and 2 ) They think it will take too much time so they do n't  get personally engaged . Let 's deal with the first issue , helping them answer the question , " What 's in it for me ? " <p> To get started , figure out what the top goals are for your key executives its going to be different for each of them . All executives make it to where they are by having a laser focus on achieving clear and concrete goals . So what are their top goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the goals on your executives list lines up with one of the objectives of your social strategy . The next step is to connect the dots between the executives goals and your social efforts lay out step-by-step how social can help that executive be successful . <p> While some executives will push right from the start for concrete metrics ( " Show me the numbers ! " ) urge them to have some patience . Its easy to show them operational numbers the number of hits , number of followers , etc . But emphasize that what they need are value metrics how social drives changes in customer satisfaction , increases touchpoints that result in sales opportunities , etc . That takes the attention and partnership of the executive to help derive the value being created by social . By focusing on the payoff that matters , you 'll be building alignment of that executive because the social initiatives success is connected to their goals . <p> The Lack of Time Fallacy <p> Busy executives say they do n't  have the time to " do social . " But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value from them ( see above ) then they should have an idea of how much time they are willing to invest in social . The problem is they do n't  know what activities they do that will drive the biggest bang for the buck ( or minute ) . Couple that with low social media literacy and its no wonder that executives do n't  want to " do social . " <p> To help them get over that initial hump , identify some very specific things that they can personally do to support the social media initiatives that drive value for them . This could range from checking a feed on their computer or smartphone to see the latest conversations taking place with customers or employees , or recording a video sharing the results of the latest customer meeting to be shared internally with a product development team . Let 's take a look at how long those activities would take : <p> Check feed on phone : 30 seconds <p> Record video : 2 minutes ( any more and people wo n't watch it anyways ) <p> Read customer reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes <p> Let 's face it the lack of time is a fallacy . None of these activities require a huge amount of time and yet they potentially can create a lot of value . The problem is defining in very concrete terms what the time/value tradeoff is and then lowering the friction to engage for the first time . <p> Reverse mentoring where an executive is paired with a subject matter expert is a great way to get started . Just make sure that your " mentor " clearly understands what the executive values or you 'll see the " lessons " canceled and not rescheduled on that executives calendar . <p> Drive Value , Not Activity <p> In the end , executives are pretty smart about what they focus on they have good radar and filters to prioritize the things that will drive the greater value for the organization . Its their job to choose the strategies and initiatives that will achieve goals in the most efficient way possible . Its your job as the social business strategist to connect the dots between social and business value . So to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being created by social business , even if its tenuous . You 're looking for just that first inkling of interest that begin with these key words , " Tell me more . " You 'll then know that you have that executive hooked . <p> The next post will look at how to explain the value of social business to the rest of the organization and drive adoption of social technologies and platforms . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

I caught up with Erin Grotts , the Director of Internal Communications at SUPERVALU , to ask a few questions . <p> Maria Ogneva : Please introduce yourself and tell us what you do at SUPERVALU . <p> Erin Grotts : My name is Erin Grotts , and I am the Director of Internal Communications at SUPERVALU . SUPERVALU INC. is one of the largest companies in the U.S. grocery channel with annual sales of approximately $35 billion . SUPERVALU serves customers across the United States through a network of approximately 4,300 stores composed of 1,102 traditional retail stores , including 797 in-store pharmacies ; 1,332 hard-discount stores , of which 935 are operated by licensee owners ; and 1,900 independent stores serviced primarily by the companys traditional food distribution business . SUPERVALU has approximately 130,000 associates . <p> M.O . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at headquarters ? <p> E.G. As a nearly 140-year- old company , we are steeped in tradition and are proud to be home to many devoted associates whove been with us for decades . Jobs vary across the retail division each store has hourly store associates , department managers , assistant store directors and store directors . These retail associates roll up to a banner ( that 's what we call chains of stores under the SUPERVALU umbrella , such as ACME , Albertsons , Jewel-Osco , etc ) . We have Store Support Centers ( headquarter locations ) to support all of our field operations as well as for our wholesale and independent business . <p> M.O . How did you used to communicate prior to launching Yammer , and how have things changed between then and now ? <p> E.G. Prior to Yammer , we connected to each other through internal email publications ( coming out of the internal communications group ) , SharePoint sites and large town hall meetings . As we started using Yammer , we pulled the plug on the numerous weekly email publications because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborative . Now associates know to go to Yammer to learn and share news . They also use it to give leaders and peers feedback on different initiatives or processes. - Our job in internal communications has shifted . We are shifting from " gatekeepers " to " curators . " We find the great things our associates are doing and help promote and share them more broadly . We have a Yammer profile called " The Grapevine , " which sources and reposts news and posts tips . Our news breakdown is : 20% official company news and 80% associate-generated news . Communications Coordinator Ashley Brooks and I , supported by a cross-functional Yammer champion group called the ySquad , function as community managers and facilitators by encouraging conversations , training others and surfacing news and featuring hot new groups . <p> M.O . Who is the ySquad and how does one become a member ? <p> E.G. The ySquad is a cross-functional group of volunteer Yammer champions who are committed to a deeper level of training . They help discover great content from across the network , connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squad , we put out a call for volunteers . We did n't  limit participation , and members are self-selected based on the upfront time commitment required . <p> M.O . How did you discover Yammer ? Who was the first person or group to use Yammer ? <p> E.G.It was the CEOs vision that brought Yammer to SUPERVALU , but it was the grassroots support of users that helped it stay . CEO Craig Herkert was brought to SUPERVALU and implemented our company turnaround strategy . Craig said once ( in response to an associate question ) : " I am most afraid that people will continue to do things the way they have always done them . When you are turning a company around , there needs to be engagement from every member . " <p> Honestly , I was skeptical at first . We still have a typewriter in our Boise office , and I wondered how this new technology was going to work here . But you ca n't underestimate peoples willingness to try something new , especially when you have long-time associates who really care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect with company leadership and share their ideas and opinions . Our associates were ready to change ; they just did n't  know how . We gave them a voice . <p> As we turn our company around , our CEO Craig Herkert stresses the importance of radical transparency . <p> Associates need to know what 's going on , and Yammer gives them the chance to do so . Senior leadership is also able to see where the challenges and opportunities are . Just like any large company , issues can get " masked " at a certain level , which means the C-suit does n't  always get the full picture . With Yammer , the days of this problem are over . We are lucky that our executive team believes in the profound impact that social media has on a company and are ready to expose the good along with the companys problems and challenges . Our CIO Wayne Shurts coined the phrase " Business fast and simple , " and if something makes us more agile , the management team is up for trying it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation in the internal communications space is really valued . <p> M.O.What do you mean when you talk about the turnaround at SUPERVALU ? <p> E.G. SUPERVALU is focused on acting as one company , working toward a common goal of delivering increased value to all of our customers and meeting their needs store by store to become Americas Neighborhood Grocer . Internally , we are working to drive an open , transparent and agile culture , while continuing to bolster what makes us great our associates , history and heritage . <p> M.O . How does SUPERVALU use Yammer ? <p> E.G. One of our main use cases is around sharing best practices across stores . We know that feeling and operating like one company is a key to our success . When we first launched Yammer , we invited store directors from different banners to the network . Once they started using it , they could see how their store was like other stores no matter what Banner name was on the outside of the building . Now they can share information to drive sales across banners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have over 1,000 groups , ranging from seasonal best practices , to gluten free food ideas , to big sporting event promotions. - There are even hyperlocal groups for beach stores or college stores . We also use Yammers external networks to communicate with franchisees , suppliers and other outside parties . We have an onboarding network for new recruits which helps them get used to the culture and understand what to expect on their first day of work . We pride ourselves on our deep tradition , and these values are critical to impart on new hires . Yammer is also a great resource for processing new-hire paperwork and aligning everyone via online chats called " Yammer Chats . " The new hire experience can make or break associate retention , and Yammer helps us provide an excellent onboarding experience . <p> M.O . How do you make Yammer part of everyday processes ? <p> E.G. Its important to really understand what makes up an associates workday . What systems do they use ? Are they sitting at their desk ?

Yammer External Networks enable companies to extend the reach of Yammer to customers , partners , suppliers , alumni , agents , franchises or contract workers , just to name a few , that are essential to your business success . <p> In many companies , realizing the need to communicate with people outside the traditional enterprise is vital , but this creates somewhat of a business conundrum ; How and why do they want to collaborate with us ? Often a company needs to feel that they know the answer and it must be right the first time , especially when it comes to interacting with your customers . This can lead to- analysis paralysis resulting in these efforts stalling before they even get deployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very complex solutions that nobody knows how or wants to use and in the end , finding out that all the external party wanted to do was to have conversations and do basic file sharing .

By using the same tool , it provides a user experience that is consistent with what your employees already use internally and helps employees focus on the conversation , not learning yet another tool . <p> You are in total control . If you want all of your customers to collaborate with each other , then you can setup one community for your customers . If on the other hand , you want your customers only to collaborate with you , then you can setup a community for each one , creating a secure environment to collaborate . <p> If the person outside the enterprise already has a Yammer account/network , this new relationship will be added to their existing account enabling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both free and licensed versions of Yammer with varying features and licensing .

@@12024775 @624775/ <h> Conversation : Let 's get it started <p> By the Yammer team , on April 26 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> One of the questions that I get asked most often is how to get a conversation started ( and keeping it going ) on a Yammer network . At Alcatel-Lucent ( ALU ) , it took 6 months of contributing and starting conversations every single day before the network reached a self-sustainable level . This was a challenging time since Yammer had just launched ( 2008 ) , microblogging was so new , that there were no success stories to share , and our company had a lot of priorities besides launching a social network . But , it was a great opportunity as well . Here are some of the things that I believe are absolutely imperative in a healthy , sustainable network . <p> Be a leader - You do not need to be an executive or even a manager for that fact . Demonstrating leadership in the network is a great way to influence the direction and tone of your Yammer network . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to understand Yammer better , they need to see the vision . Share with your community ( no matter how small ) , what the vision is . Do this frequently in the beginning until more people get it . For me , it was " I see Yammer as being a way for us to find answers quickly in the company from areas that we would not have access to using any other tool . " Its even better if your community helps shape the vision . <p> Be Interesting This is possibly one of the most challenging things for people . Nobody likes to think that they are not interesting . But in business communications , - interesting has traditionally not been one of the key objectives . In Yammer , you are trying to get people to consume your content and pay attention to what you have to say . If your contribution is boring , chances are people will see it that way , even if you are the CEO . Think about what draws- your interest or what might matter to the people you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever , colorful or even a little mischievous . One of my favorite words actually came from one of my bosses . He said , " Go ! Be- provocative ! " . One way to be interesting is to draw upon your passion . Passion comes through in your writing . <p> Be Patient This is harder than you may think . You are passionate , you know the answer , but letting the community respond instead of you is very powerful and important . <p> Lead conversation by asking questions I had a vision for how I thought Yammer could be leveraged , but telling others would do little more than get them to say , " So what ? " or " Yea , Right . " . Instead , I asked a lot of questions . I would examine what challenges we faced within the company and then ask if Yammer could help to make it better . Sometimes this by itself was not enough ; I would also throw out an idea if nobody responded to the original question . However , the idea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example : " What would be the value of providing Yammer on mobile to Sales teams to get answers for customers faster ? " <p> Define Actions The power of Yammer really comes through when you can can move a conversation from having a discussion to taking action . When asking questions , especially early on , try to identify if there are actions that you or someone in the community can own and execute on . This will help to demonstrate that Yammer is just not about talking , its about getting things done . <p> Have an opinion , but be open to changing it Most would call me opinionated , and I would agree . I use my opinion to start a conversation , to seek better understanding . I would n't hesitate to put a stake in the ground and make my opinion strong , to be provocative . Most of the time , this was what I thought , but sometimes it was just to get a conversation going on a topic that seemed to be going nowhere . When I made my strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant and/or just plain wrong . But , what people came to realize was that through conversation , I was able to be influenced . I used my opinion to start a conversation , not end one . I would encourage people to challenge my opinion and then I 'd acknowledge their points ; then I 'd challenge them back if I felt that their points fell short of the mark , with the purpose of finding a single view that all could agree on . <p> Help others solve their problems I spent most of my time trying to provide value to the company . I have a varied background , and when someone asked a question that I knew the answer to , I answered it ; when I knew someone else who could , I made a connection . Even though I was not in IT anymore , I was able to help people with things like password resets , SharePoint and Instant Messaging , just to name a few . These were not things I was responsible for , but I was trying to create an environment where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change I wanted to see in the company . <p> Be willing to make mistakes Many companies have a low tolerance for mistakes . There are many reasons for this . Most of them are political , so you need to be careful here . In many debates online , you are going to realize that you are just dead wrong . Sometimes the tendency is to keep fighting just so you do n't  have to admit you made a mistake . When you are trying to develop an ESN , this type of behavior will kill conversations ( or at least make you irrelevant and ignored very quickly ) . Freely and publicly admitting you were wrong and willing to listen will go a long way to help people want to engage with you . <p> Create a positive work environment The tone of a network is defined by the community . You will have new people coming into the community every day . These new people will have varying levels of experience and expectations . If they come in and see that your ESN is a battleground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none . One way to help newcomers feel welcome is to acknowledge them as they join and ask them to introduce themselves . Once people are engaged in conversation , do n't  hesitate to nudge them if they seem stuck in a situation . Its through this assistance that people will feel comfortable sharing the things that they really need to know . Quickly interject if you see a post that state things like , " Boy , that was a stupid question ! " Remind people that we are not here to judge each other , but solve business problems , and that its a great way to get the answer broadly socialized across the company . <p> Avoid Sarcasm ( at least without labeling it as such ) I throw this in because I 've been burned by this in an effort to be funny , ironic , or challenging . Sarcasm rarely comes out online in a way we intended , due to non-verbal cues . My answer for this was to be a little geeky and use " &lt;sarcasm&gt;Who cares about security ? &lt;/sarcasm&gt; " . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point instead of stating an opinion . <p> Have a Support Network The part that helped me solve the challenges the most and have the strength to keep going was having an active support network that related to the challenges that I was facing in my efforts to drive change through an organization . For me , it was the 2.0 Adoption Council . Their help and support brings the experience of many into each of its member networks . I highly recommend finding a group like this and actively participating . <p> Even if you have been using Yammer for a while , and the network has a defined tone , its not too late to influence and shift the tone to be more productive with a little work . These core principles will help drive a healthy Enterprise Social Network ( ESN ) in your company whether it is 50 or 50,000 people . <p> While I 've tried to share- some of- my techniques for driving conversations in an Enterprise Social Network , they are far from exhaustive , and may not work in your particular circumstance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the techniques you use to drive conversation in your Yammer network .

@@12024779 @624779/ <h> The Right Information At The Right Time <p> By the Yammer team , on November 9 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Knowledge workers today are challenged , to say the least . There 's too much information , the information is in many places , and its hurling at us with unbelievable speeds . We lose a lot of time searching information ; in fact , according to the IDC " Hidden Costs of Information Work in the Enterprise " study , an average knowledge worker loses 6.2 hours each week looking for information and not finding it . These are the hours employees could spend doing actual work or updating their skills , and executives could make decisions that much faster ! <p> Curiously , there seem to be two opposite forces at odds with each other . On the one hand , there 's the- hyper-growth- in volume of information , and on the other hand there 's the need to wade through this information quickly in a world that moves faster and faster every day . Let 's take a closer look at these two movements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todays business world is nothing like it was 10 years ago even 2 years ago ! Todays marketplace moves faster than ever before , and as businesses we must become more connected in order to work with these shrinking lead times : <p> The Social Customer is empowered , educated , hyper-connected and ready to join hands and form a groundswell in a matter of days . Just check out Dave Grays account of how customers self-organized to pressure Bank of America to reverse the $5 banking charge decision and succeeded . Being able to understand emergent issues and respond quickly is of critical importance . <p> Employees can now become accidental spokespeople for their company , as social shrinks the distance between Customer and Company . If they are in a position to represent the company , they need to be able to get answers quickly . <p> Employees are requiring their workplaces to be more social , and a recent Fast Company article points to how connectedness trumps salary among young workers . To retain the best talent , companies need to become more connected . <p> There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innovation is only speeding up . Cloud computing and developments in enterprise mobility have enabled truly global collaboration helps assemble the resources that you need quickly . This has really lowered many competitive barriers , leveling the playing field between small startups and large corporations alike . The good news is that you can now innovate faster . The bad news is that your competitors can now innovate faster also . <p> Feeling the pressures from customers , employees and competitors , businesses must adapt and evolve to become more social , collaborative and connected . However , most businesses and knowledge workers today still face the following roadblocks to finding the right information at the right time . <p> Silos : Decades brought on by the Industrial Revolution have left us with extremely siloed organizations . Silos were established to properly flow information down the reporting hierarchy . If you wanted everyone in a department to know something , you 'd have to run it through the department head , who would in turn disseminate it downwards . This originated from necessity , but does n't  work anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed of social . <p> There 's more information than ever before : The amount of information created by the worlds population has been growing at a dizzying speed , and its projected to grow 50X over the next decade , per a study by IDC. - We are buried in info as consumers and as employees , and its getting increasingly more difficult to locate signal among noise . According to Twitter , it took- 3 years , 2 months and 1 day to amass one billion tweets , and now it sends a billion tweets weekly . Now , the service handles a billion tweets every week . More activity per network is only half the story though there are also more and more services sprouting up all over the place . <p> Business data is trapped : What do you get when you add business silos to the skyrocketing data growth ? You get incredible amounts of data trapped in siloed business systems . <p> So where do we go from here ? <p> Embrace discovery : - Its no longer enough to know your functional area well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the periphery of your network to be effective at your job . While before you got everything you needed from search , now you need to proactively set yourself up to discover useful information from inside and outside of your immediate networks . Tune into the signals beyond your immediate department at work ; explore the the larger company network and your personal networks . You may learn a few things in unexpected places that can help you in your professional endeavors . <p> Be deliberate about your content : As information producers , we have to be deliberate about the information we put out there . Because we inhabit social networks with other people i.e. you share your Yammer network with your colleagues we have to be cognizant of etiquette and create information with the end goal of it being found . When you state that as the goal , you think about your content differently . <p> Create environments where discovery is possible : As organizations , we have to commit to creating environments where sharing is allowed to happen and serendipity can flourish .

This fundamental upgrade in the way we communicate is helping organizations move faster and become more competitive , regardless of size , geography or industry . Gartner predicts that " by 2013 , spending on social software to support sales , marketing and customer service processes will exceed $1 billion worldwide . " At Yammer , we are seeing growth numbers that further prove robust interest and growth in Enterprise Social Networks ( ESN ) . <p> As a company in hyper-growth , Yammer faces a lot of the same challenges that it helps customers solve . We drink our own champagne and test a lot of our theories on ourselves . As the ESN market continues to expand , our customer-facing teams have been forced to rethink our internal processes and methodologies . Traditionally , the Sales , Customer Success , Support , Security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a customer relationship . In order to both scale and enhance the Yammer customer experience , that needed to change . <p> To address this challenge , our team set out to create an " Engagement Playbook " that would get our teams on the same proverbial Page throughout the customer lifecycle . To do so , we created an interconnected web of content and conversations housed in a unifying Yammer Group titled " Engagement Playbook . " <p> In order to launch in time for our Global All-Hands Kickoff , we had to design , develop and deliver the Playbook in just four weeks . During that time , 60 colleagues worked together to build the Engagement Playbook . We learned some valuable lessons along the way , and the following summary of the steps we took can be used as a blueprint for anyone wishing to crowdsource a project with tight deadlines and limited resources . <p> 1 : Plow : Define a clear objective , tenets , framework , and timeline <p> A common misstep in crowdsourcing a project is to engage the crowd too early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe for disaster . Rather than immediately involving everyonewho might be interested in contributing to the Playbook , I took a day to synthesize what it was we were trying to accomplish and establish some direction on how we were going to pull it off . I focused on the following four areas : <p> Key Tenets : Key tenets provide a framework for making decisions throughout the project and establishing a value system for the team to agree upon. - If you 're going to crowdsource a project , it is imperative to pay special attention to these conditions . <p> General Outline : While Outline may sound like the antithesis to a crowdsourced project , providing some general structure is essential to keeping the project focused and driving consistency across the contributors . The purpose of the Outline is to create suitable conditions for collaboration , not to define a rigid structure for how the team should work together so make sure the outline is flexible and can be iterated upon . <p> Timeline : Demarcate key events on across a timeline . This will help keep everyone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of a few peers , the following Engagement Playbook Outline Yammer Page was written , vetted and published marking day one of the Engagement Playbook development effort : <p> 2 . Seed : Engage the Crowd <p> Youve plowed the field , now you 're ready to start planting seeds . Like any project , engaging the team who will be contributing to the project should not be approached recklessly . Target a subset of the contributors based on expertise , influence , and bandwidth to serve as project facilitators . Or as John Kotter would say , create the Guiding Coalition . These facilitators will play an important role as stewards of the projects objective , tenets , outline and timeline . Drastically increase your odds of success by identifying the individuals goals or motivators that are aligned with the success of the project . Does this project make their role easier ? Does their involvement offer recognition ? Does it allow them to influence their own role or future ? <p> With the core team engaged , you are now ready to make a splash . Draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple communication channels and soliciting support from key leaders . This will help increase the size of the participating crowd and reduce the average time required per contributor . Like with the facilitators , look to forge personal connections to the success of the project . Clearly translate the " what 's in it for me " and underscore the importance and value of the project . Stress the unique nature of the project and how each contributor will be empowered to directly impact the outcome . <p> 3 . Grow : Monitor and Encourage <p> The seeds have sprouted ; now focus on cultivating their growth . As the project lead , your job is to monitor the activity of the various teams , keep everyone motivated , and ensure that the crowd is tracking against major project milestones , building short-term wins . <p> At this stage in the process , the use of collaborative technology becomes critical to your projects success . By keeping conversations and content open and shared across the team , issues are more rapidly identified , gaps are more quickly filled and the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of collaborative technology , however , is its ability to connect the team on a human level . Each contributor builds off each others enthusiasm and motivation , creating a vigor that results in a rewarding , efficient , and enjoyable experience . <p> Closing : <p> We finished building the Playbook a full week before we presented it to the organization at our Global Kickoff . Every team beat every milestone , and every contributor felt a sense of accomplishment , ownership , and engagement with the outcome . We now have a solid and scalable foundation to support our growing customer base , teams , and organization ; allowing us to focus on what matters guiding our customers through their social transformation . <p> If you 're interested in learning more about how the Engagement Playbook was developed or how you can leverage Yammer to save time and increase the efficiency of your team , contact your Yammer CSM. @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024784 @624784/ <h> Receiving Too Many Yammer Messages ? <p> By the Yammer team , on November 14 , 2008June 28 , 2017 0Shares <p> One of the most valuable aspects of Yammer is the ability to control the content you receive . As opposed to email where the sender has control over distribution of the content , Yammer empowers the receiver to control the content they receive . This enables you to surface only the content that is most relevant and interesting to you . <p> With our latest release , which included the Groups feature , we made a few changes in regards to the updates that you receive by default . Aesthetically , we changed the name of the Following feed to My Feed . We also changed some of the functionality : <p> Following feed Only messages from people or including tags that you follow <p> My Feed All messages from people , tags or groups that you are following and your General Feed , which consists of , all messages not posted to a Group . <p> The reason we include General Feed messages in My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the All feed to My Feed . Therefore , people that were not using the ' following ' feature would still receive updates . At the same time , the noise was reduced because many people started using the Groups feature and Group messages are not included in the My Feed , unless you joined the particular group in which the message is posted to . <p> If you were using the Following feed before this latest release , or your network is large , and or you are receiving too many updates because of the addition of General Feed messages , you can easily disable the General Feed . To do this follow these steps : <p> Click the My Feed vertical tab <p> Click the ' i ' icon on the My Feed vertical tab <p> Disable the General Feed check box <p> This change will revert the functionality of the My Feed to only display the messages from people , tags , and groups you are following . If you 're receiving too many uninteresting messages in your My Feed , this modification may be of interest to you . 
@@12024785 @624785/ <h> Seek to understand ; focus on value- <p> Everyones got a job to do including your executive . A persons desire to adopt and use a work tool is only going to be as strong as the tools ability to produce results . To help your exec use Yammer , make sure to take some time to understand their needs and suggest ways in which you can drive real results . <p> Ross Cavanaugh , Internal Collaboration Consultant from Wells Fargo advises : " First &amp; foremost , I 'd focus some time BEFORE the meeting to understand what his/her hot buttons are , as well as a few of the current biggest pains ( issues ) that Yammer might help or resolve . While there is no silver bullet , the areas I might focus on if I went to this meeting blind are : Value / ROI and Engagement . <p> Simon Terry , CEO of the HICAPS unit- of NAB recommends focusing on relevant topics that help them be better leaders . " It is especially important if you can show discussion of a topic important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 1 . Get their messages out , but differently reach people you do n't  talk to often in a two-way conversation . This is great for clarifying strategy , learning about progress or customer issues 2 . Discover the potential of your people- insights , talents , diverse interests , their networks . <p> Christine Brown , Internal Communications Manager- from City of London recommends understanding the leadership style first : " All I can say is it depends on the manager , as they have very different styles and approaches . If I could generalise about what pushes most peoples buttons , itd be : <h> Make it easy <p> As you identify the value you will help capture with Yammer , make sure to ease them into the process . Even though social interaction is second nature to you , remember that its not that way for everyone . Social can signify a departure from how execs have communicated in the past , and some coaching and education will be necessary . <p> Miguel Zlot , the Enterprise Social Networking Evangelist from a large consumer goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their day : " I always ask them the following question : How much time do you spend in airports waiting around ? Normally the answer is " A bunch " , then I proceed to load Yammer on their mobile phone or tablet and show them how they can quickly scroll through messages , reply and like them . I have seen greater participation once we have done this . " Jennifer Thormibert , Community Manager- at Disney echoes Miguels advice : " With the mobile app , I find senior managers like the ability to quickly read or post from the elevator , or in an empty meeting room when waiting for others to arrive , etc . " <p> Andrew Pribulka- in Technical Marketing of Arlington County echoes this sentiment : " Understand the value of the mobile app since most of our upper managements schedule is spoken for on any given day , its important to encourage engagement in between meetings or while travelling to an appointment , which can be done thanks to Yammers mobile app. " - <p> Lise Hansen , Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little things that can ease people into using social : " Every interaction on Yammer does not have to be witty , thoughtful , vetted post . Spending 5 minutes a week liking a few posts shows you 're there and you 're recognizing others for being there also . " Lise also advises bridging the gap between existing communications channels , such as emailing into Yammer . Simple tips for emailing into a Yammer group even putting the address of groups into their contact list for them can help bridge the divide . " Because fear of more e-mail reigns above all else , assure them that they can manage the notifications in their email inbox . " <h> Feedback is a powerful thing <p> Humans are encouraged by feedback they receive from others execs will likely energize employees and be energized by their feedback . Miguel Zlot shares his experience : " I once demonstrated the power of a like from a Senior Executive : I asked him to randomly like a post and within minutes the person responded back to him , and started to follow him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never met and probably never would . Show your executives that with simple interaction , the user become more engaged because they feel the higher ups are interested in their work . Everyone knows how valuable engaged employees are , so there 's no need to re-hash it here . " <p> Jonathan Anthony , Director of Corporate Communications at- Teekay shared that in his network , " exec participation gets 4 x average engagement ; there is thirst for knowledge and reward for participation . " - <p> Simon Terry warns about the other side of the coin , though : " People do n't  always flock to discuss your post ( especially if it looks like PR ) . Your title or reputation might even be intimidating , and Yammer is a way to change that . " - <h> Being more informed <p> There 's more and more information available to us , and businesses are required to move faster and faster to keep up with what their customers need . This can be a problem if there 's a lack of executive visibility into what 's happening across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , as reports presented by their direct reports , can be skewed. - <p> Miguel Zlot shares that social can help ground executive better by exposing them to more and better rounded information . " I believe the higher up in a company one gets the more detached they get to the grassroots of the company and what people are working on or having issues with . One example I use is that we had a very senior person in one of our business units get upset that people were posting about Wine on our Beer Network . She expressed her dislike until she found out that Wine Wholesale is a big part of our business in the UK . Everyone can learn something on Yammer no matter how high up they are . I have learned more about our business in the past 3 years than the previous 12 before that . " <p> Jennifer Thorimbert of Disney says : - " If you have a geographically separated team , its an easy way to stay on top of what everyone is doing if you encourage people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadblocks . " <p> Because enterprise social networks act as dynamic containers of current and cutting-edge knowledge , the right information is just a click away . To that end , Lise Hansen advises to use the search functionality : " Yammers great search can help them get a pulse on a topic . They will be amazed at the quality and range of topics theyll find . " <h> Friendly competition <p> When getting execs to participate , you have to remember that they are a competitive bunch . We certainly are n't  suggesting manipulation , but a bit of friendly competition never hurt anyone ! <p> Miguel Zlot corroborates this story : " The number one thing that will get C-level people engaged is when another C-level person hits the jackpot with a post on Yammer . We had the CEO of our Canadian business unit hold a contest to accompany him to the hockey game , which included beers and food . The CEO made up the contest and the questions for the contest , and it was the single most active post on the network ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and posted himself . This set all the other c-level people into a frenzy trying to figure out how to do something similar . If one c-level does it and gets great response you can be sure they will all want the same thing . " <p> Simon Terry agrees : " Social proof works . Find a peer or superior of the Senior Manager who is an effective user . Show the Senior Manager the posts and response that the other manager is getting from the community . " Simon suggests that participating in an internal network can be a great primer for participation in the larger social community : " You know that thing called social that everyones talking about and you do n't  know how to use ? We have built you a private playground with friendly people where you have unique power and influence . Come experiment and learn to impress your peers with your social chops . " <h> Influencing employees <p> To add value , you need to help executives do their jobs which is setting a direction and getting enough buy-in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need to give employees what they need . <p> What do employees need ? Jonathan Anthony says : " The number one thing employees want from leaders is not " strategy " but " honesty . " So , reminding leaders that their voice , true , pure , humble , is in need in the organization is the #1 item . Leaders take themselves too seriously just shoot the breeze in public . It will make you feel better. - <p> Jennifer Thorimbert talks about the importance of trust and simplicity : " You can build trust and connections in your team by sharing just a couple sentences , rather than a LONG ... <p> Andrew Pribulka advises that to resonate with employees , executive communication needs to have two aspects : <p> 1 . Consistency balanced engagement over an extended period of time rather than too much engagement for the first week and nothing after that . 2 . Simplicity convince upper management that commenting on Yammer is n't held to the same communication standards as an official memo . <h> Results- <p> The above tips can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer . But do n't  take my word for it ; the proof is in the pudding !

Not surprisingly , however , many of them end up asking the same question : where in the world do I start ? <p> Initial- ideas about- gathering information to determine what to automate- might- include- conducting a survey , interviewing key members of various teams , or simply starting to list tasks that- you- feel should be automated . <p> The irony- with that approach ? The process of determining what should be automated- suddenly starts looking- pretty manual . <p> Automation Anywhere Cumulus- has- partnered with Yammer- to- quickly and easily- get the information you need about automation from the- people that trudge through- tiresome manual tasks every day . Using Yammer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate community- can suggest tasks to be automated , and other users can vote on tasks they like best or agree with most . Conversely , managers can post initiatives , and users can- suggest ways to hit that goal through automating tasks . <p> The best part ?

We 've stayed true to this , but our product has come a long way since we first launched , evolving to become a full-fledged social network for the enterprise . <p> Since today marks a major milestone , we thought it would be fun to take a look back at what we 've been up to the past two years . As the Community Manager at Yammer , I spent some time chatting with our founders and captured on camera a few of the highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout this post . <p> In 2008 , our founder and CEO , David Sacks , and co-founder and CTO , Adam Pisoni , were working at Geni in Los Angeles when they first came up with the idea of Yammer .

After several months , they had a prototype and began using it internally at Geni to test the product and the concept overall . I asked our CEO at what point he knew Yammer had the potential to become a global company , and here 's what he said : <p> Fueled by the win at TechCrunch50 , Yammer hit the ground running and began building out the product further . With a growing team and huge promise for success , the company relocated to San Francisco in Summer 2009 . <p> In the two years since we launched , companies around the world have adopted Yammer as their Enterprise Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies are using Yammer , and in less than two years , we welcomed our one-millionth user , making Yammer one of the fastest enterprise software companies to reach one-million users . <p> Our customers have had a big hand in influencing the direction of our product . What sets us apart from many enterprise software companies is that we develop our product with the end user in mind , and we are very thankful to have so many passionate Yammer users who have given us feedback and inspiration . Some of the major product enhancements over the past two years have involved expanding our product to include B2B communication by introducing Yammer Communities , updating and broadening our mobile applications , integrating with other products such as Microsoft SharePoint , Twitter and Skype , and improving our search functionality . In just a few weeks , well be making another major product announcement , unveiling the Yammer platform , our own applications , and a new user interface . <p> While I was chatting with David and Adam , I asked them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've made . What impresses Adam the most ? Find out in this next excerpt : <p> Weve achieved a lot in the past two years , and we could not have done it without each and every one of you .

I 'm using Notes to take and maintain minutes from meetings with clients as we map out how to roll out training to them . I 'm sharing Files with my colleagues for feedback and discussion , utilizing their countless stories and experiences . Ive been able to discuss and share ideas on upcoming projects with co-workers on the other side of the country , some whom I 've never even met . Yammer is really changing the way I 've viewed " working . " As I 'm writing this , I cant believe Ive only been at this job for a little over five months . From delivering training at client sites , to facilitating Power User Training at Yammer on Tour to speaking at sessions at Microsofts World Partner Conference , the last five months have been a whirlwind . The most amazing thing though is that I was at full productivity after about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer , I 've been able to hit the ground running . I do n't  think it would have been possible , if Yammer wasnt used as part of the onboarding process . Now , you must be thinking , Yammer for onboarding ? <p> From the get go , I 've been immersed in Yammer . Before my official start date , I was given access to an external network called Yammerversity . This gave me a chance to work in Yammer right away and expose myself to its different features and functionality . ( I came from a company that did not use Yammer , so this was my first exposure to it ) . Through this , Yammer and I were able to achieve a couple of things : <h> 1 . I became familiar and comfortable with my new job role . <p> As more and more people continue to use Yammer within a company , it becomes a knowledge repository . Conversations specific to my team and around their notes and files , are a treasure trove of information on getting up to speed . Being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really helped me to know what was expected of me and how I could immediately contribute to the team . Part of my onboarding process was to go through the Yammer certifications . As I was going through them , I shared my feedback on things that needed to get updated and how to improve some of the quiz questions . This was then used to update our certifications. <h> 2 . I was able to learn about company culture and get access to job related resources . <p> Cynthia Hanson put a fantastic Preboarding Note together that contained links to various e-Learning modules covering Yammer basics , the history of Yammer , and the culture of the company . By the time I stepped into the office , I already had a sense of the people and the company . Once I was given full access to the home network , I was added to a group called Yammer New Hires , which had additional Notes on benefits information and company sites I should be aware of . The best resource of them all though was all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about our commuter benefits , I did a quick search and found my answer . If I could n't find an answer on Yammer , I could post it to the company ( in the appropriate group , of course ) , and know that someone will be able to help me out . <h> 3 . I was able to start to build relationships and network . <p> The first thing you 're supposed to do once youre granted access to the Yammer home network , is to post a #bammerintro . Bammer is a nickname for a baby Yammer , or a noob . In your <p> Bammer intro , you are supposed to introduce yourself to the company and share a little bit about yourself . Folks across the company can " Like " your message and reply with their own welcomes and greetings . This one little exercise is a great start to building relationships . When I finally visited the company headquarters , people already knew who I was and I knew who they were based on our interactions in Yammer . I already felt like part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cynthia B. , Cynthia H. , Kristin , Louise , and Natalie . <h> 4 . I was able to feel engaged and valued . <p> Working out loud in Yammer creates transparency in what I 'm working on and what other people are working on to . Allison has mentioned me on conversations that she thinks are relevant to me or that I can provide value to . Through this transparency , I can see my comments and suggestions are being read and used . Just the other day , I put together a deck about what to do now that you 're a Yammer Certified Power User . Allison loved the idea and wanted to use it in our other certification programs . <p> These are just a few of the ways Yammer has eased my transition to my new job . If you 're looking for a way to jolt your onboarding program , try making it a little more " social , " you 'll be pleased with the results . I know I was . <p> So , how about you , the Yammer community ? Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you learning ?

@@12024796 @624796/ <h> Fear And Enterprise Social Networks <p> By the Yammer team , on December 22 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> " The only thing to fear is fear itself " Franklin D. Roosevelt <p> Enterprise social networks are gaining mainstream acceptance , but to some companies they still remain shrouded in mystery with " What If " s popping up like mushrooms after rain . If you are launching an enterprise social initiative , a big part of your job is going to be answering these questions and helping manage these fears . As you do so , please realize that the folks who are giving you resistance can become allies instead of impediments , and its up to you to turn the conversation around . Its also important to realize that the most significant sources of fear are : loss of control and lack of understanding . You can minimize the former by underscoring that bringing things out into the open helps guide the conversation and fix the underlying problem . You can change the latter with proper education . Let 's take a closer look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disspel them : <p> Myth 1 : Enterprise social networks are timewasters <p> One of the most frequently voiced social network fears is that everyone will socialize all day and not work . One key point that I think is relevant for all social media internal or external is that social is a manifestation of who you already are . If you are an unproductive member of your team , at some point people will realize it , with or without a social network . If anything , social networks put you on your best behavior because well anything you say is preserved in writing . If you are indeed a timewaster , everyone will know it including your boss . This is an interesting implication for employees as well as managers ; employees can use this as an opportunity to showcase their expertise , while managers can find expertise . <p> Myth 2 : People will post inappropriate content <p> Let 's face it if you do n't  know what 's appropriate and what is n't , you are probably going to have a tough time in any professional situation . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this explosion can happen anywhere , whether or not you are on Yammer . Although social media can accelerate your public faux pas , its never going to be responsible for it . As the network community manager , make sure you know the difference between slightly cringe-worthy and wildly inappropriate . There 's no use overreacting and alerting everyone for a slightly off-color joke have a private conversation with the offender , and reserve serious punishment for an appropriately sized crime . <p> Myth 3 : People will post confidential information <p> Your legal and IT teams will want to review your social network for security and compliance if you plan to discuss sensitive information on it . Its important to realize , though , that any secure software is only as secure as the human factor . A disgruntled or uneducated user can potentially grab a screenshot of your internal communication whether its cloud , on-premise or even an e-mail . Your best strategy to prevent these situations from happening is through education and creating and enforcing policy . Additionally , you should take a look at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below ) and proactively eliminate any impetus for disgruntled employees to go rogue . <p> Myth 4 : It will become a negative environment <p> Negativity will happen ; humans never feel happy 100% of the time . When it happens , just be prepared to deal with it , but the real goal is to nip it in the bud . The mood in your network will reflect the mood in your organization , and if things get overly negative , you have problems that are far , far greater . You may be suffering from a debilitating deficit of trust , employee buy-in , passion , " brain drain , " innovation stagnation , among other unpleasant characteristics . If your employees are n't  engaged , - they will not see much value in contributing to a shared creation space . If they feel like their ideas get shot down and mocked , they will look for an organization that appreciates them . If they feel like management is n't honest , they will disengage and eventually defect . <p> But do n't  take my word for it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which- Forresters Rob Koplowitz and Tietos Juha Krapinoja discuss these fears that fail to materialize ( this specific discussion starts at around 41:00 , but the entire webinar is worth a listen ) . In his Yammer network , part of Juhas mandate is to ensure that no confidential information is shared and " no unpleasant tone happens . " - Heres a remarkable nugget of insight from Juha : your early users are going to establish community norms for the future , so make sure you are inviting the right people . <p> Net-net : what you fear will probably not happen , and if it does , you will be able to respond because you planned ahead ( you really should ! ) <p> To ease your organizations fears of things that may go wrong , make sure to follow these steps to success : <p> Accountability A network like Yammer is open , transparent , and links to employees real profiles . Transparency increases accountability . People want to do their best because everyone is watching , including the CEO , their boss , their teammates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being " that guy " at the holiday party ; however , while the egg-nog induced haze fades , your digital identity is forever ( or until your company keeps it ) . <p> Your culture : Your internal community simply reflects your culture , while also helps build it . If you have a high-producing , highly curious culture , which inspires constructive dissent , discussion and creation , you will get the most out of a platform like Yammer . If you have a customer-centric culture , your employees wont put customer and partner relationships on the line by disclosing private information for personal gain . <p> You have a goal : If you are clear about your goals , the vast majority of your employees is going to support the objectives you outlined . It pays to have a solid vision for your network and education that helps people understand their roles and direct benefit to them . <p> Create policy and educate : When you create your policy , give HR , IT and legal a seat at the table , but avoid " voting by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend your existing electronic policy that already covers email , while taking into consideration intricacies of human networks and how content spreads . Educate your users on how-tos , best practices of engagement , as well as dos and donts of your policy . Make sure to differentiate between major and minor infractions . <p> Activate the community to take action : Properly educating employees not only ensures that individual contributors have a chance to shine , but also allows the entire community to regulate itself . To echo Juhas point , your early members can serve as models for the rest of the users . Make sure you have share the same vision and give them the tools to be successful . <p> You have a response plan : In the unlikely event that your worst fears are realized , do not panic ! Your ability to handle any crisis situation is going to hinge on the work you already did . Have an escalation process in place and define roles and workflows . <p> Back to you , reader !

Can you describe it in a sentence ? <p> At Yammer , we firmly believe that culture plays a big part in success of internal communication and collaboration . As we develop this platform to help companies communicate and break down silos in their organizations , we are learning from our own use of Yammer . Creating a culture within Yammer can be successful as a platform , has been of utmost priority . <p> As we discussed in a blogpost earlier this week , the key characteristics of a successful culture are : - transparency and openness , knowledge sharing vs. hoarding , authenticity and organizational flatness .

If you allow for serendipity to happen , you may be surprised at what happens next . <p> Knowing who people are and what they do may be a challenge for large , distributed organization . Its also hard for a company that 's growing quickly , and Yammer is a prime example of that kind of company . To make sure we are communicating well and onboarding new people , we use a blend of offline and online techniques .

@@12024802 @624802/ <h> For Enterprise Social Networks , how much adoption is enough ? <p> By the Yammer team , on January 4 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> In traditional enterprise change initiatives , you tend to start with a defined set business requirements to address a given problem or opportunity . Socially-driven enterprise change , however , is different because parts of the organization are already changing prior to full articulation of a problem or solution . Companies find their employees using social technologies without any formal support within the organization . People are finding value , but may not be focused on quantifying that value into a business case that can be used to support the effort . <p> Once a company finds itself in the midst of groundswell of social adoption , it needs to determine how to effectively integrate it into its culture and operations. - And a key consideration is ; " How pervasive must adoption be ? " - To determine the answer , the organization must understand the scope of the solution : - is it a global one or targeted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map the population to the Adoption Curve to best predict when users will start using the solution . <h> Effort/Cost of Adoption <p> If we look at the effort it takes to achieve widespread adoption in a large enterprise , the further you get along the curve , the more effort ( and cost ) is needed to get people on board . This typically means engaging smaller groups that may have very specific individual reasons for not adopting social , and may require things such as small team meetings , printed collateral , travel and other off-line channels . At the extreme , this may include classes and/or mentoring programs to help people get up to speed . <h> The ROI of Adoption <p> As we start to examine the ROI of social inside an organization , we must start with the value and then subtract out any cost to achieve this value . The further along in the adoption curve the higher the cost of getting people on board . This increased effort has an impact on your ROI and can significantly decrease the ROI without significant gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each individual contributor provides potentially equal value ) . The actual value to the organization can only be answered if you determine where your stakeholders and use cases fall on the adoption curve . This can be achieved by performing a Stakeholder Analysis to determine where the various stakeholders fit along the adoption curve and the potential value each represents . For example , Sales may be late adopters because they are too busy focusing on customers to experiment with new tools and processes but may offer great value by shortening the sales cycle . <h> When to stop ? <p> Knowing when to stop focusing on adoption is difficult , but I would offer that once you reach the point where the costs are starting to impact the ROI in a negative way , that you should give up on adoption and focus your efforts elsewhere . In an average large organization getting 100% adoption is very unrealistic . Usually complete adoption falls in the 60-70% range due to many factors. - This does n't  necessarily mean that you are reducing the value that your solution provides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ROI equation , leading to higher efficiency . This is something IT has been doing for years . <h> What about the rest ? <p> Focusing on getting the Late Majority and Laggards to adopt social technologies may not be your best use of effort initially , but eventually they may become participating members of your network . Keep focusing on the people who drive value out of the solution and the others will eventually catch on ( or not ) . It is through recognizing the success that the solution creates , that the others will participate . Even with that being said , there is a small fraction of your employee base that will never use a solution . Their reasons in many cases are valid . I would encourage you to try to understand why people do n't  want to use the solution , but not put a lot of effort into trying to change their minds . <h> Where to focus ? <p> Knowing where you effort can be best realized is a challenge as it may be different for every company , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the value with the least amount of effort . <p> One area would be to help to ensure the people who are using the solution are leveraging it to the maximum . I can not begin to tell you how often I see solutions ( both social and non-social ) implemented where people are only using 10-15% of the capability . When I asked to better understand their jobs , I often come across many more ways they could realize value , but they seemed to lack the understanding of how they could do this . A good way to do this may be through a capability blog , where you take one capability and demonstrate how it works and how people are using it to make their jobs easier . <p> Another area of focus could be around bringing new employees on board . Since these individuals are new , they are much more likely to adopt something new and can be brought up to speed using these new methods of getting their jobs done faster and better . One thing to keep in mind is that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users will also change ; you should be periodically checking to ensure that the new user experience remains easy . <h> Conclusion <p> While there are no hard and fast rules for determining when to shift your focus , by understanding where your key stakeholders fall on the adoption curve , you can better understand the timing . The cost of adoption will eventually cut into your ROI this realization should drive your actions . By continuing to share the success that your adopters are realizing inside the organization , you will eventually draw the others in . Behavior change always takes a long time ; it is always best to be patient and focus on activities where you can have greater impact . @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024803 @624803/ <h> What 's Passion Got To Do With It ? <p> By the Yammer team , on June 21 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Ive been thinking about passion for a while and started to really think about it after I picked up a copy of- " The Power of Pull " by John Hagel III and John Seely Brown . If you have n't read it , you definitely should . It offers a non-sensationalist yet sobering view into reasons , consequences and , most importantly , ways to thrive in the era of " The Big Shift . " The Big Shift signifies a move , facilitated by technology , away from predictability and to a world that changes at an increasingly rapid pace a world where todays competitive advantage may not be defensible tomorrow . <p> As a business , you survive by pulling the right resources towards you at the right time ; your greatest source of competitive advantage is , of course , your people . Its the concept of adaptability described by CTO Adam Pisoni so eloquently in this video . To truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracts the best people to you , but also helps them tap into their passions . <p> " I 'd like to suggest that- passion is all about commitment to personal improvement . In contrast with- obsessions , which are all about losing oneself in an external object , passion is all about connecting with , and developing , ones own capabilities . " <p> Passion in a business : <p> Weve talked about the empowered employee : an employee who is able and willing to take action in the best interests of the company . I see passion as the missing link between knowing that you should do something but doing just enough and doingmemorable and extraordinary work that inspires and moves forward not only the business , but the world at large . Passion is the fuel for empowerment ; its what drives people to push forward , beyond themselves . <p> Because , you see , changing the world is not rhetoric : its what people consumed by passion do . Passionate people do n't  think in terms of checklists and widgets ; they see the world through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the type of person necessary to reach and exceed their potential . We 've often relegated world-changing passion to entrepreneurs , but in todays environment , everyone needs to act like an entrepreneur . Features are commodities , and customers do n't  want incremental improvements . Whether or not they themlseves realize it , customers want products that help them thrive in anxiety inducing , dizzying change . To deliver products that help their customers do that , companies need to think bigger and do better . <p> Passion moves companies . Collective passion , laser-focused on the same goal , has the potential to move the world , improving organizations by helping individuals improve . Passion is n't additive , its multiplicative passion begets more passion . Companies with passionate employees tend to attract like-minded employees and energize customers . As such , the organizational imperative is to create an environment where passion thrives . <p> I can tell you that Yammer is a very special place because of our collective passion . Our internal passion helps us overcome obstacles , as we are singularly driven to change the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we innovate and attract the right resources and people to help us execute . We are n't  moved by static task lists ; we are moved by banding together to get done whatever needs to get done . Employee and customer passion is symbiotic for us , one feeding the other . Our customers exhibit outward signs of passion towards Yammer because together we are making the world a better place by helping organizations and people maximize their potential . <p> From an individuals viewpoint : <p> As individuals , we feel the stress and anxiety just like companies do . There are more and information streams to look at , and the way we do our jobs is changing fast heck , this may even be the the end of a job as we know it. - Just to keep our jobs , we have to out-innovate our competitors and keep winning the hearts , minds and wallets of our customers its getting harder by the day . For people with passion , its easier to stay focused on what 's important , as everything else becomes clutter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because passion is not situational . People who simply go through the motions will always feel frazzled ; people with passion will never feel frazzled because they are n't  scared of the future or uncertainty . <p> When I posted a draft of this post on our Yammer network , Matt Partovi , a brilliant ( and very passionate ! ) colleague of mine alerted me to this video of Steve Jobs talking about passion as the thing that keeps you going when others would give up . This clip is very much worth watching : <p> As part of the same conversation , Matt echoed how much easier a task at hand is for someone with passion he feels energized doing things he enjoys , while things he does n't  enjoy drain energy . <p> Sure , we 've heard the adage for years follow your passion and the rest will come . But how many people you know follow their passion , or even know what it is ? I think we 've been making the mistake of defining passion too narrowly . For example , if I was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that would really limit me to working with social networks . But if I reframe my passion into " I am passionate about the change social has on the world , " I can unleash my passion onto a greater variety of worthwhile goals . <p> People often ask me if they should have a separate social identity for their personal life and professional one . I used to explain it as a blurring of personal and professional worlds .

But what happens when we start doing work together , not just talking about it ? Wed be leaving money on the table if we do n't  ; in fact , this collaborative opportunity was- quantified by McKinsey as 1.3 Trillion dollars. - What does it look like when a- business works together with its community- - to create products , go-to-market strategies , content and marketing ? <p> Something happened the other day in our customer community , which is an example of such collaboration and a direct result of a participatory relationship . It started when a- customer posted a link to- this McKinsey article on Leadership 2.0. - This happens often in our community , because the environment allows participants minds to wander , explore the bigger picture , question and challenge the status quo . This post prompted an interesting discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture in a social organization , and whether this sweeping change is a revolution ( which is what it often feels like ) or a more subtle and graduate evolution . As a " host , " our role in this conversation was to draw people in , ask questions and promote deeper thinking . Customer and thought leader Simon Terry posted some brilliant thoughts that I thought merited a public blogpost ( I 'm hoping that he will write a book one day ! : ) . - After a few simple messages back and forth , he created- this post. - The whole thing took just a couple of days and one revision . <p> Why does this matter ? - This very simple act is actually more profound than it seems on the surface , as it manifests a shift in action , marked by a shift in thinking. - To the participants it felt really natural ; however , it can be anything but natural if you do n't  think of your customers this way . Working this way- requires a fundamental shift in how companies view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and action. - Your customers and partners are no longer idle consumers of your information ; rather , they are active participants in the future of your field and your companys role as part of this future . <p> In the above example , the conversation did n't  start with the purpose of creating a piece of content . It fluidly and naturally evolved through the unstructured , yet committed interchange , and there was room for it to do so . There were no preconceived notions , just the commitment to challenge ourselves and each other and come up with a solution . Participants were invested in the conversation , and the blogpost became an extension of it , not a method to reach it . The final result was thus inspired and not forced , and writing this blogpost was n't a dreaded responsibility on Simons part . It just happened , and we moved in its direction together . Everyone benefitted as a result . We as a company furthered an advocacy relationship with Simon that goes beyond signing the check and got powerful " social proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share his thoughts with a broader set of people via a thought leadership platform . The entire community benefitted by getting involved in a mind-expanding dialogue . We did n't  market to the community , but we created artifacts together ; the community was part of the message , not an idle spectator . <p> While the above line of thinking can be abstracted to any group of stakeholders , let 's focus on customers for now . If the purpose of a business is to create a customer ( per Peter Drucker ) , then the purpose of marketing is to help your customers to create new customers , and customer communities offer an unprecedented way to do so and at scale ! The purpose of customer communities then is to inspire and connect customers to each other and to the original intent of their purchase and loyalty . Your customers do n't  buy your product for the sake of buying your product ; they buy it because it makes them- feel- or- be- a certain way . Find out what that intent is , help them build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause into working with each other and you . What can they do together that they cant do alone ? What is your role in all this ? <p> For example Our customer community exists to help our customers actively shape their own and each others experiences and successes with Yammer . Yammer is not about being social for the sake of being social ; its about enabling the behavior change that helps companies become more adaptable . When they buy Yammer , customers buy transformation and adaptability . Being part of the community helps them realize this value , as well as help all of us shape how we think about the future . They have truly become our partners , thought leaders and collaborators , not just success stories we talk about . <p> Of course , as a business , you are n't  always going to be able to leave things to chance and just move in the direction of the conversation . Sometimes it does n't  happen . You still need process , official messaging , and you need to have a goal to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other stakeholders deeply , and from the beginning . In addition to involving them in your process , try to expand how you see each other and move in the direction of their thought and action .

The Yammer team returned to the Westergasfabreik to welcome over 600 customers from more than 40 countries . Throughout the afternoon , attendees had the opportunity hear the latest thought leadership on the future of work and Enterprise Social . Our customer community also had the chance to share their experiences of working like a network . <p> Keynote : The Responsive Organization Yammer Co-Founder and CTO , Adam Pisoni , delivered the opening keynote about the impact of disruptive technologies on business . For Adam , innovative technologies are becoming so ubiquitous that there 's no longer much of a competitive advantage to just having it . The new competitive differentiator is an organizations- ability to work differently in order to take advantage of the technology it already has . Companies that continue to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are constantly being disrupted by those that can respond faster to customer needs . <p> So what can businesses do to get ahead of these recent trends ? Simply put , organizations- need to evolve . They need to work like a network to keep up with the pace of change and the increasing amount of information in the digital age . Companies like Qantas , Westfield , and Nationwide are able to move quicker through open communication , experimentation and working like a network . To those in attendance , Adam laid out three key calls to action for kickstarting this workplace transformation : <p> First of all , start small . What can you accomplish immediately ? <p> Second , do n't  feel like you have to convince people who disagree . Find people who are ready to embrace change , and work together with them . Focus on the green dots . <p> Lastly , focus on workplace initiatives people really care about . Engaged and passionate employees are those who feel like the work they 're doing matters . <p> Learning From Our Network of Customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a network is to hear from organizations who have successfully undergone that transformation . That 's why we partnered closely with some of our biggest customers to develop this years customer panel and breakout sessions . <p> Successful social initiatives start off with a clear vision and buy-in from leadership . <p> Make it as easy as possible for people to participate by embracing mobile workers , and making your intranet social by integrating with existing platforms . <p> Allow your staff to find value in themselves by supporting " bottom-up " adoption . Some of the most impactful ideas come from two people having a conversation . <p> We were excited to hear these customer stories and insights , and hope attendees came away inspired as well .

@@12024807 @624807/ <h> Community Managers : Do n't  Try To Do It All On Your Own <p> In true community spirit , this post was written by Maria Ogneva and Bryony Cole of Yammer , with participation from our customer community . <p> Pop quiz : a community manager needs to answer every question true or false ? <p> If you answered " true , " you may want to read the rest of this post . If you answered " false , " you should consider writing a post for this blog . Seriously . <p> There are a few reasons why a community manager should n't do everything . <p> Its not healthy for the community or for you as a community manager . If you do everything all the time , you will burn out , quit your job and move to a small coastal town in Costa Rica good for you ( eventually ) , but not good for the community . Jokes aside , any community that 's overly dependent on any one person is not healthy and will suffer if that person is not available . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community to be an environment where people come to co-create something bigger than themselves , you need to model these behaviors as a community manager . When people cant get in a word edgewise , they eventually disengage , and you can kiss your community mission goodbye . The community can derive far better outcomes through a participatory environment than any one person ever could . <p> People do n't  scale . By being way too dependent on one person from the beginning , you are reducing your chances of successful scaling . What happens when the community manager gets sick , goes on vacation , or moves jobs ? <p> Community management is less about managing and more about enabling others . Its about building a community that self-sustains through the right dynamics , and a huge part of that dynamic are a group of power-user ambassadors who act in the interest of the community , educate others and model healthy community behaviors . Our customer community has coined the term Yambassador . <p> Getting budget for a community manager is oftentimes a challenge ; the perception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workload unnoticed by others in the organization . While employing an extra set of hands may seem like a fantasy , there are already many potential community manager clones lurking on your network today. - <p> Yambassadors are typically power-users who adopted the platform early and/or easily . Being highly engaged on Yammer is n't part of their job description ; they do it because they love it either for what they get out of it , for the connections they make , or the difference they can make in their organization . <p> Let 's take a look at how an active network of Yambassadors can help propel a community to the next level . <p> Find your Yambassadors <p> You must be thinking to yourself , " These Yambassadors sound great ! But how do I find them ? " Do n't  worry ; they will choose you before you can choose them all you have to do is listen . Observe the top contributors and conversation starters . Who is sparking the most conversation ? Who is helping others out ? Is someone using the platform in a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invite them to be part of the Yambassador program . <p> Mark Allotey , Intranet Manager from Telefonica O2 UK , says " I asked a group of people to help me with some of the community management aspects of Yammer . I looked in the leaderboards to find the people who use Yammer the most , and messaged them to sound them out about being a Yambassador . " <p> In her previous role at Tyco , Phoebe Venkat , Director of Digital and Social Communications for ADT , informally recruited Yambassadors and set them up in a private group after the formal launch . " They are helping me and my communications team with greeting people , providing tips , sharing resources , etc . They also serve as informal monitors pointing out and addressing inappropriate content , etc . " <p> Manhattan Associates calls its Yambassadors " The Lone Nuts , " which comes from Derek Sivers " How to start a movement . " Lone Nuts drive questions &amp; posts to the appropriate groups so new users are n't  overwhelmed by Yammer. - Former community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of the first followerwithout them , you 're just a " Lone Nut . " Acknowledge &amp; nurture those first followers because they are essential to starting a movement &amp; leadership . " <p> Recruit from across the business <p> Ideally , these Yambassadors are spread throughout the community , representing various companies ( in external communities ) and various business units ( in internal communities ) . - Phoebe Venkat recommends that " you surface likeminded champions of employees across the business to help guide others . Its good to have a cross mix of functions , titles , etc . This is especially important in huge , highly matrixed organization . " <p> Stuart Campbell , Governance and Portfolio Coordinator from VicRoads , has found that using Yambassadors to help promote Yammer within business areas with specific use cases has been the most successful . <p> Yambassadors help a community scale by providing support where it may fall through time zones or simply escape the eyes of the official community managers . Having a support network when you are managing a real-time 24/7 network is particularly important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office hours . <p> Learn to let go and trust <p> Community managers tend to be deeply invested in their communities and feel an unhealthy need to be always on . Its much like a parent diligently watching over the network , making sure everything is going well , everyone is happy and there are n't  fires to put out . And just like a newborn baby , you cant turn the network off it needs attention , a lot of attention , no matter the time or the day . The mistake most make is feeling alone in nurturing their network. - To feel less alone , you have to surround yourself with the right people who can help and inspire them to rise to the challenge . You must trust and nurture them . <p> Nurture and pay it forward <p> The only way that a community manager can scale is to invest in Yambassadors today who can then turn around and invest in the next crop of Yambassadors , and so on and so forth . With the right Yambassador base , your community can scale infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you pay it forward today with education and helping align the rewards of Yambassadorship to individual motivations . Your primary job as a community manager is to give the resources to the people who will serve as a resource to everyone else . <p> - Set up a private workspace <p> Set up a private group for the Yambassadors to discuss the network , community management best practices , share tips and generate ideas . Be sure to include lots of informational resources , and encourage the team to share and problem-solve together . Think through the " new Yambassador orientation , " including easy access to resources in a Welcome Note . Welcoming new Yambassadors helps them feel special and well-resourced to take the next step . <p> Phoebe Venkat says : " I like having the Yambassadors group as private instead of public . We do n't  have anything to hide , but sometimes we discuss information that may be confidential or simply not reasonable to share with the wider network . " <p> Joe Robens , IT Strategy Manager at Aristocrat , shared : " Support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great sign that the user base gets the tool a bit more . Support specifically is peer based with no formal training . I have set up a group with videos and docs for people to use . " <p> Be open and engage early <p> If you want to motivate your Yambassadors to truly shine , share your plans with them early on and make it easy to contribute . This gives people " skin in the game , " and increases the quality of your ideas . Co-create the charter and Yambassador role definition together . With 20 Yamassadors , Phoebe Venkat held a planning call to establish how to serve an ever-growing population . This meeting yielded a one-page description of roles and responsibilities and WIIFMs ( what 's in it for me ) for Yambassadors . <p> Mark Allotey says : " Its a purely voluntary role , but they 're already people who are demonstrating some of the Yambassador behaviors and are big Yammer advocates . I 've created a written overview to explain the details of the role ( which I shared prior to them signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important . I 've asked the Yambassadors to help me refine and shape this role further . " <p> Win hearts and minds <p> Make sure your strategy for engaging your Yambassadors also engages them ! Make being a Yambassador fun , exciting and prestigious . How can you help them ? What do they want to hear about ? If they love the platform , perhaps show them an advanced sneak peak at new features , before others see them . A plan for engaging your Yambassadors should include regular communication and recognition . Because different people are excited by different things , remember that one reward does n't  fit all it can come in the way of Yambassador status , public recognition and praise on yammer network , messages from and access to executives , and with physical gifts when appropriate . <p> Build culture together <p> Christoffer Christie , Business Readiness Lead at NAB , shared : " Yammer is a great tool to support your culture . People co-create culture ; technology enables . Try exploring your culture using Yammer . Get a group of 5-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration . Use a Yammer group to come up with seed questions about culture for your main company feed . Ask your Yam Champs to commit to 5+3 : to spend at least 5 minutes 3 different times a day contributing to these culture discussions . Perhaps identify some key behaviors the Yambassadors will model . " <p> Work together to engage the C-suite <p> Joe Robens advises : " You need a C-level champ to step up and start using it . I started with direct reports to the CEO and started a bit of a competition by telling them who was in the lead . This way when I did speak to the CEO about Yammer , he was well aware and jumped on board . I had to pitch it ; but he got it and now sends regular- Yams- with his thoughts . " <p> Go multi-platform <p> A meet-up in person or a phone call is a nice way to supplement all the digital activity . Host a Yam-up session with your Yambassadors off the network . Its a great opportunity to really get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to listen . Excited users have plenty of suggestions for how to use Yammer many you may never have thought of . <p> Divide and conquer <p> Do n't  try to do it all yourself ; share the responsibility ! Giving an enthusiastic user a specific area of responsibility increases their sense of ownership over Yammer and stimulates more positive behavior . This may include owning a specific task like welcoming new users to the network or running a poll of the week . <p> Yambassadors help stimulate conversation , train other users , moderate the network and continue to find new and useful ways to use the platform . In turn , reward them with status as part of the Yambassador group , recognition , and a sense of co-ownership . The effort of a team to pull a sled will ensure you slide a lot faster toward your goals , and frees you up to do even more . You might even get a good nights sleep .

To introduce those themes to a wider audience , he put out a Social Business Cookbook that compares business transformation to kitchen artistry . Because after all , everyone likes talking about food . <p> The cookbooks subtitle is " How to get a faster and higher return on projects and collective know-how , " and it offers tips for using enterprise social solutions like Yammer to listen to staff and customers , adapt to the realities of the marketplace , and grow a business . <p> Hansen is passionate about the benefits of collaboration , which he s seen firsthand at his company , Grundfos , which is the worlds largest manufacturer of pumps . With more than 18,000 employees around the globe , Grundfos has discovered that social solutions like Yammer , Lync , and SharePoint are essential ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was originally just for internal consumption , but since Hansen is a strong advocate of social tools , he and his team are sharing their experiences through the cookbook and also more broadly on their blog . <p> Working Out Loud <p> As Grundfos has become more globalized , its staff has learned to collaborate online as a way of transcending borders . " But we have to be much better at that , which is why we are changing the way we work , " Hansen says . " Until recently , we have been solving tasks more or less on our own , or by involving colleagues close by . But to stay competitive , we have to collaborate across business units and borders . We have to change the way we work . We have to learn to work out loud . " <p> By " working out loud , " Hansen means asking questions , sharing drafts , and lending expertise across the organization . " Its about getting more out of the work that we already do , " he adds . " Its about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective know-how . We want to collaborate as if we were colleagues sitting under one roofdespite our companys global nature , large number of employees , and rather complex product program and organizational structures . " <p> As outlined in the cookbook , Grundfoss social business push is designed to " drive business growth , innovation , and strategy execution by leveraging opportunities and ideas , collaborating effectively , and reducing inefficiencies . " <p> A two-fold increase in productivity when it comes to executing events and projects <p> A two- to three-fold increase in business-process quality <p> Significantly better return on the companys collective expertise and know-how <p> Improved identification of sales opportunities <p> Deeper understanding of market sentiments <p> Sales intelligence that bests the competition <p> Listening that Leads to Success <p> For a taste of what 's in the cookbook , well start with Hansens recipe for problem solving through crowdsourcing : <p> Ask a specific question and include your timeline <p> Post the question in Yammers Global Grundfos Community <p> When people give input , ask follow-up questions <p> Cultivate newly discovered experts <p> Share feedback with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this recipe , Hansen cited the experience of a Grundfos business consultant who needed input on global export challenges to prepare for an upcoming meeting with an international trade council . She posted her query on Yammer , then quickly gathered examples to strengthen her caseand connect with experts shell consult with when future issues arise . <p> According to the Social Business Cookbook , the results from that particular exercise in social listening were tasty indeed : <p> Global reach of request after less than five minutes effort <p> Input from multiple people with cross-organizational expertise in less than 24 hours <p> Total problem-solving time of about 18 minutes <p> Adapting to Tight Budgets and Timelines- <p> The Social Business Cookbooks recipe for the socially supercharged launch of a product catalogue included these directions : <p> Be clear on the purpose and success criteria for your project <p> Understand that you have to be effective together without meeting and traveling <p> Make a private working group on Yammer ( allowing asynchronous 24/7 collaboration ) <p> Agree on wanting to succeed doing virtual teamwork <p> Bring the entire task and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project on email <p> Execute by combining local physical mini-events with digital support <p> The cookbook then delved into the example of a team of four Grundfos employees spread across three time zones tasked with planning and executing an internal catalogue launch in six weeks with a budget of $1,200 . The goal for the launch was to increase the target audiences awareness of Grundfoss service-products portfolio from a level of less than 10 percent to at least 50 percent . <p> Hansen reported that the teams efforts yielded delicious results : <p> 400+ people ( 70 percent of the target group ) were reached during the launch <p> About 40 percent engaged actively to give immediate feedback to the project team <p> Project execution on time within budget <p> Looking at the bigger picture , Hansen estimates that Yammer and other collaboration tools have delivered a veritable smorgasbord of benefits : <p> Global events executed for 50 percent less than planned costs <p> More than 40 percent reduction of e-mails for collaboration and project development <p> Non-productive meeting time cut 10 to 20 percent <p> Reduced traveling expenses <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to replace an in-person gathering of the companys top talents with an innovative virtual one . The 48-hour webinar used a private Yammer group to bring together senior executives and graduates of Grundfoss Global Talent Development Program . During that period , teams from 55 international markets joined forces in real time to solve problems on tight deadlines , using the time-zone-spanning collaborative capabilities of Yammeras well as perspective from executives who used the network to answer questions , comment on projects , and provide online briefings . <p> Not only did the webinar save a bundle on travel , it gave Grundfos a valuable knowledge repository , since Q&amp;A material was accessible after the virtual event . Although some were initially disappointed when the in-person gathering was canceled as a cost-saving measure , the programs graduates rated the webinar a huge success . One of them commented , " This was one of the best experiences I have had with the talent programs I have attended It just had a different vibe to it . I had my reservations coming in , but it exceeded all expectations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " extreme efficiency " of the social business network , and they were impressed as well . <p> A Better Bottom Line through Transparency <p> Hansens cookbook has a simple recipe for cost saving : <p> Ask a question in the " All Company " Yammer feed <p> Spot an opportunity in the open thread and reassign it to the appropriate Yammer group for further discussion <p> Bring in experts to verify and arrive at a solution <p> That recipe has been replicated many times at Grundfos , including a recent effort that serendipitously led to a smarter approach to buying software licenses . " Duplication of effort and other inefficiencies result when similar threads of work that could be joined up are not , " Hansen observes . " That 's where having a single enterprise network like Yammer makes all the difference . " <p> The example given in the cookbook involved a project manager looking for training material for a software tool . When he put the call out on Yammer , he discovered the material he neededas well as the fact that it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Further Yammer crowdsourcing unearthed the fact that most of the companys software licenses were purchased individually . That sparked a decision to consolidate them into one group agreement , saving Grundfos $20,000 . <p> As Hansen sums it up , " Working out loud on an enterprise social network like Yammer has yielded exciting benefits so farand were even more excited about the future .

We live in a world of constant change , where companies must learn how to adapt to survive . Your products and your goals for those products will inevitably change over time some faster than others ; so building an organization that embraces change is crucial to maintaining a competitive edge and staying ahead of market shifts . <p> So what is the best way to approach organizational structure ? First , you must be willing to abandon the traditional org chart . Your organization is comprised of all of the ways employees communicate and collaborate to build your products and get work done .

Two weeks ago , Charlene Li , best-selling author of Groundswell and Open Leadership , answered this question in an interactive Yammer webinar with hundreds of business professionals attentively listening and asking questions . The- five questions below were posed by webinar audience members to Charlene and Christina Fan , Lead Customer Success Manager at Yammer. - The following responses are based on- Charlene and Christinas combined real-world- experiences with- how to successfully work social : <p> 1 . Jeff:Why does engagement fall off , and why do you think those folks would fall back into the habit of using other technologies ? - <p> Charlene : The main reason is because they are n't  seeing the value from the new technology platform . If there really were value , theyd obviously continue to use it . That 's the key reason why focusing on use cases that address high pain points and thus create high perceived value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey . People also fall back into using other technologies because of installed base pressure . For example , when you get emails from people , you tend to take the easiest route and reply back to them via email . Its the path of least resistance , but not necessarily the path of most logical and valuable outcomes . <p> 2 . Matthew : Is the 1-9-90 rule in social the best an organization can hope to obtain ? - <p> Charlene : There is plenty of research that shows that the 1-9-90 engagement rule is defunct . But there also is n't a " perfect " or " ideal " level of engagement . One interesting thing to note is that engagement levels as measured as " creating " and " commenting " are off the charts for some markets like China , Brazil , Turkey , Philippines , and South Korea . The U.S. is actually middle of the road when it comes to engagement levels overall . And other factors ranging from proximity and affinity to other group members , to passion for the topic also greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels to gauge success , go back to WHY you are deploying the technology in the first place . Ask yourself : are you successfully addressing the pain points that drive the deployment ? Are you seeing impact on the business ? These kinds of metrics can happen even at low " engagement " levels , so do n't  assume that higher engagement is always a good thing . <p> 3 . Lonya : How can you gain support for a staff to manage your ESN ? - <p> Charlene : We recently worked with a company that was trying to expand their staff of 1 FTE to 2 FTEs , to manage an internal community of 35,000 . The key was to demonstrate the value that the existing FTE was creating , and then very specifically explain what an additional FTE would be doing to drive additional value . The key then is walk it back what would happen if the company did NOT invest in the additional person ? What business objectives would be harder , more expensive , and slower in their achievement ? <p> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer to collaborate with my industry peers ? - - <p> Christina : The free version of Yammer has all of your collaboration features of a paid network without administrative controls .

@@12024821 @624821/ <h> Running a Successful Yammer Event <p> By the Yammer team , on July 13 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> People love purpose-driven events where they can meet other people and talk about things that interest them . In the digital world , you are no longer bound by physical limitations of having to be in the same place at the same time . The popularity of Twitter has given rise to tweetchats , popular online gatherings of people discussing certain topics and using hashtags ( # ) to easily group conversations . Did you know you can do the same thing on Yammer ? One of our customers , Austen Hunter , - wrote about his experience with a Yammer event at his company . <p> Oftentimes , this is a good way to conduct a " townhall " meeting with executives or around a topic . Because the conversation is not bound by limits of time and space , the conversation can develop before and after the actual online chat . Here are some success tips to ensure that this event goes off without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to fail <p> Even though the nature of a Yammer event is all about honest , realtime conversations , you must plan for success . We recently conducted a Yammer event with the Yammer Customer Community . Prior to the event , we did a lot of preparation around big picture stuff like goal and vision , as well as executional details like dates and general logistics . There was also lots of communication lots and lots of it ! <p> The first key step in planning your Yammer event is figuring out a topic , purpose , audience , event leaders , and timing. - For our inaugural event , we wanted to keep it broad , but depending on your use case , it may be better to find a more consolidated topic and keep the conversation focused around that . <p> Once we set a date and decided a topic ( a strategic " state of the Union " and peek into the future townhall with Yammer CEO David Sacks ) , we had to figure out the actual details of the event : <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all future conversations , into which we invited our cmmunity . We recommend inviting your entire target audience into the group so they wo n't miss the conversation even if they do n't  go . We do recommend doing it in a separate group because it will be easier to find and refer to , without overtaking the main feed . <p> We chose a topic for the chat , so that people can easily follow the conversation . In Yammer , topics act much like hashtags in Twitter , uniting conversations and making them easily searchable . In Yammer , you can follow topics , as well as people . <p> Just like with any community effort , you have to lead by example and illustrate the behaviors you want others to do . We recommend seeding some questions and getting community members to submit questions ahead of time . <p> When a Yammer event happens , the conversation moves at a million miles a minute , so you have to make structural decisions before it starts . Will you have all the questions and answers in one thread or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the latter , so each question could act as its own thread-starter , prompting its own conversation . <p> We recommend having more than one person help coordinate and communicate the event . This way the tasks can be shared if needed . <p> Communicate for success <p> We created the event and initial communication about it in the main feed . This communication included a request to post questions to the events group . You want to create the event at least 2 weeks prior , but not too far in advance so that it gets stale . <p> We broadcasted this announcement to make sure that it delivers to each community You should choose the method that works for your network broadcast , newsletter , invitation cards , etc . As with seeding questions , look for your community " movers and shakers " to help you communicate , as long as the content is something that your community actually wants to talk about . <p> Prior to the event , and at the start , clearly communicate republish rules : is it OK to tweet / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing things publicly . <p> Get executive sponsorship <p> If the goal of your Yammer event is to boost internal engagement and get everyone excited about a more open and collaborative paradigm of communication , we recommend to involve a senior executive . Exec sponsorship in general is a big part of your success in internal communication strategy . <p> To drink our own champagne , we put our CEO David Sacks front and center during this event . First , he shared the Yammer vision and strategy with everyone in a webinar format , and then answered questions and engaged in a conversation directly and in real-time . Because your exec is probably really busy , make it easy to work together by taking care of the details early : communicate the vision , the timeframe and logistics . <p> Showtime ! <p> At the beginning of the session , make sure you restate the objective and introduce the format , topic and the key participants . Things will move very quickly , so make sure that you either share the burden of typing across several people or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were uncharacteristically lucky because our CEO is extremely tech-savvy and also types very fast . However , depending on the level of facility with the tool for your organization , you may need to either do a little more tool education or plan for multiple executive participants . <p> Because this is a conversational medium , you will inevitably come across questions that are n't  clear ; in this case , do n't  be afraid to put it out to the rest of the community for the clarification and to help shape the conversation . Back-and-forth is expected , and most answers got more questions , which got more answers. - Make sure you stick to the topic you preselected , and gently nudge the conversation towards it during the event . <p> It helped us have several people at the table collaborating for answers , bringing different perspectives and insights . Having scribes was also extremely useful in a situation where a question repeated itself . In that case , a scribe would post a link to the existing question . Scribes during the event were really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention where it should be drawn to during the chat . <p> We were able to answer the majority of the questions in the time span allotted and continued the conversation afterwards .

@@12024825 @624825/ <p> As Yammer has been growing explosively since its launch 2.5 years ago , our community has also grown . Our community consists not only of our users and partners , its also of third-party developers . Without third party developers , we would n't have apps like YammerFox , the Firefox extension , among others . Our relationship with developers is so important that we hired a fulltime developer advocate Mikeal Rogers . I sat down with Mikeal to talk about his job and his upcoming goals in this Q&amp;A-style interview : <p> Q : Hello Mikeal , can you please introduce yourself ? What do you do at Yammer ? <p> A : My name is Mikeal Rogers , and I 'm the developer advocate here at Yammer . I act as a bridge between third party developers and Yammer . I 'm an advocate for people who use our API . Check out this short video of Mikeals job in his own words : <p> Q : How did you find this job ? <p> A : Yammer put a call out to hire for this position , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially been a developer advocate for years . In the past , I worked as an engineer for Mozilla ; since its an open source project , there was a fair amount of advocacy that naturally came with the job . After Mozilla , I was an early employee at CouchOne . CouchOne was a product for developers , so essentially everyone there was an evangelist . <p> Q : What are some things that you 've accomplished since you 've been here ? <p> A : So far ( over the past couple of months ) , I 've improved documentation and created a new developer landing page . Ive been promoting the developer community and developing resources for them , such as a more comprehensive walkthrough of the OAuth flow . <p> Q : What are your strategic goals ? <p> A : I want to help people using the API ; currently the flow is a little difficult . I 'm going to make it easier to use the API . Another objective is to proactively reach out to developers in other communities to use the Yammer platform . <p> Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Online communities as well as conferences and events . On average , I travel 30% of my time going to various events . I 'm also deeply involved with some conferences . For example , I 'm on the programming committee for OSCON and the lead organizer for NodeConf. - I 'm currently helping out 3-4 other JavaScript related conferences . <p> Q : Do you find larger or smaller events more productive ? <p> A : Smaller events all the way ! Smaller events tend to be frequented by innovators , while larger conferences cater to more of a mainstream audience that 's trying to figure out how to fit tools into their workflow . I try to keep all events in which I 'm involved in as small as we can . <p> Q : With so many communities and projects to look after , how do you prioritize ? <p> A : Having come from the open source community , I have a strong workflow in place that I adopted years ago . As a general rule , I make a priority anyone who is blocked from doing their job . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would help you first . If I 'm not traveling and helping people get their jobs done , I 'm working on my longer-term projects . <p> Q : - What do you think are the success characteristics for a solid developer advocate ? <p> A : A good developer advocate needs to first and foremost be able to think of people outside their organization . When we work somewhere , we adopt an internal process and forget what its like for someone from the outside . " Also , you have to be a true advocate for your community , no matter what it takes sometimes you may have to upset people inside your own company , and you ca n't be afraid of that . " <p> And there you have it our new developer advocate Mikeal Rogers is here to connect Yammer to its developer community .

I could talk about best practices and ways of using certain features to their fullest potential . Alternatively , I could ask our customers to tell me their stories about how they are using it , illustrating best practices and creative approaches . I 'm thinking the latter is far more effective . So without much further ado , let 's shine the spotlight on BostInnovation , a news organization focused on startups and innovation in Boston . <p> BostInnovation started because there was a pronounced need in Boston and on the East Coast in general to establish a community voice for Boston-based startups . With so many universities in the area , the city of Boston is ripe with innovation . BostInnovation was started with the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture blog , of sorts , highlighting what universities are doing and what new startups are springing up . The cool thing is that BostInnovation does n't  simply focus on web startups , but startups of any sort , such as food trucks ! <p> So where does Yammer come in ? <p> Use of hashtags makes Yammer a " dynamic CRM " : <p> BostInnovation has a hybrid model of core employees and editorial freelancers , and they use Yammer to communicate effectively . Greg Gomer , Tribal Leader of BostInnovation , says that one of the main uses of Yammer has been that of a knowledge base , almost a dynamic CRM of sorts . Because BostInnovation tracks companies and news and events associated with these companies , the team uses hashtags extensively to mark their own posts , guest posts , events and external articles . By using hashtags , Yammer places them into topics . If a team member was about to write an article about tablet technology , for example , he or she would simply navigate to the search box , pick the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> " Working in a newsroom requires our employees to constantly be in the know . Without Yammer , stories , leads , and other communications would simply get lost in email , creating a massive bottleneck . Yammer has streamlined our editorial process , " says Gomer . <p> Alternative to spreadsheets : <p> We 've always seen Yammer as an efficient alternative to replace some of the email functions , such as : brainstorming , status updates , team updates , Q&amp;A . BostInnovation has taken it a step further by using Yammer as an efficient alternative to spreadsheets ! Gomer says that it creates a nice repository of everything that 's properly tagged , and you can go back to the first day the company yammed . <p> Using groups zeroes in on the signal : <p> BostInnovation also uses groups extensively . They use private groups for core , fulltime members . In these groups , they talk about management , strategy , and the business side of running the news organization . Public groups exist for all community writers to get story leads , exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer on the go : <p> The modern employee is on the go a lot . However , the BostInnovation crew is on the go more than an average team . Because they are in the field chasing and creating stories , the Yammer mobile apps and desktop apps are huge competitive advantages. - The alert system has proven out to be huge because of the time sensitive nature of BostInnovations work . Writers need to be alerted to anything pertinent to the story they are working on . Also , editors are often alerted when a story is done . <p> BostInnovation has been using Yammer for the past 9-12 months . Theyve been such fans of the product that theyve even written this blog post . Gomer says that it was easy to pick up , but it took a little while to develop and document their own best practices and make sure that people adhere to tagging topics the same way .

@@12024832 @624832/ <h> How Great Leaders Reduce Managerial Blind Spots <p> During one of the leadership trainings at Yammer led by Professor- Francis Flynn , we discussed the relationship between expertise , organizational rank and confidence . Its not what you think ! <p> Experts are n't  at the top of the org chart <p> While initially counterintuitive , this concept makes sense after some consideration . Experts are the ones doing the work ; they are the ones on the front lines . Experts are at the forefront because they 've chosen a specialization and are consistently accumulating experience in the field . The further you move up in the org chart , the more business areas fall under your prevue . Naturally , as you become more removed from the daily execution , your line of vision into specific areas of expertise fades . Your expert skills dull in comparison to experts who practice their craft every day . You become a generalist who has to go wide vs. deep . You need that wide view to understand how the various pieces of the puzzle fit together . <p> Managerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , your decreased line of vision into functional areas and market needs can lead to blind spots . You are relying on your organization to surface information for you , as you cant see everything with your own eyes . This information asymmetry can be accidental ( I forgot about this or I assumed you already knew this ) or deliberate ( I do n't  want you to know this ) . Whatever the cause , information asymmetry leads to managerial information blind spots , which in turn inevitably lead to poor decisions . The difference between a great leader and an OK ( or terrible ) one is the awareness of these blind spots and active work to remove , or at least reduce , them . <p> Decisions have wider ramifications <p> Paradoxically , while visibility and deep expertise decrease as you go up the chain of command , decisions start to have wider ramifications . To ensure that these far-reaching decisions can be good decisions , access to accurate information is paramount . Unfortunately , due to blind spots and murky line of vision , managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ todays world , however , " I did n't  know " hardly cuts it as an excuse . <p> Social technologies democratize information by increasing access to it , across organizations and between businesses and their customers . Information can now flow freely to all levels in the organization , including upwards to management . The paradigm of a leader thus becomes someone who is open to dialogue , connected to information , committed to considering feedback and humble enough to change his/her views . This kind of leader is more intent on creating environments where information blind spots can be eradicated , instead of brandishing information as a competitive weapon . <p> Overconfidence leads to bad decisions <p> The more expert we become at something , the more we realize how little we actually know . I remember myself when I was 13 I thought I knew everything , and I 'm sure you did too . And just like you , the more I learn these days , the less I know and the more open I am to knowledge and alternative viewpoints . <p> Paradoxically , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know and may feel the false confidence that comes with lack of experience . When leaders and managers do n't  know what they do n't  know and especially when they are used to people telling them what they want to hear they lose inertia to search for alternative viewpoints and challenge their decisions . This myopic view leads to making bad decisions because it does n't  allow for the possibility of being wrong , or the desire to learn more . <p> Reducing managerial blind spots <p> The practice of- working out loud , as detailed by- John Stepper , - - or narrating your work ( also read this- great post- by Harold Jarche ) is well supported by an enterprise social network . By narrating our work , we can solicit feedback before we proceed too far in any given project . The practice of narration also let 's us share what we 've done , which helps us show vs. tell our own expertise and learn of what others are doing and good at . Its a much more natural alternative to the weekly recap . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I do ! When I remember to do them , its always a painful experience trying to think of what I did that week or what I will do the following week . This is especially difficult in fast-paced environments where projects move around and get displaced by other projects and tasks quickly . If you consistently narrate your work and use the right taxonomy to organize , you will have a running list of accomplishments and lessons learned , which is always available to you and whoever else is interested in it . Managers can then avoid information blind spots by simply curating , consuming and tying together relevant signals from across the organization . <p> Leveraging expertise of others <p> Another way in which narrating your work removes managerial blind spots is through openness , which invites contribution of others . This way , leaders who are in the throes of making a decision or putting together a strategy can do a gut check with their experts and solicit feedback . The key thing is that this can be done without proceeding too far in a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeing up resources to pursue something meaningful and helps the manager " save face . " Access to better information quite simply increases the quality of decisions made , and good decisions lead to lower costs , higher profits and higher morale . <p> If you are in a leadership position , how do you avoid informational blind spots ? If you are an employee , how do you keep everyone in the loop and raise your visibility/expertise ? How do you narrate your work ?

Unlike most of the Yammer employees participating in Hack Day , Paul does n't  have a college degree in a technology-related field , or even any college degree at all . And yet unlike most of the Yammer employees who participate in Hack Day , Paul does have the coveted Hackers Choice double-horse-head trophy , one of only two premiere prizes awarded on Yammer Hack Day . <p> Pauls story is unlike that of most winners . On a typical day at Yammer , Paul is a member of the facilities team . His specialty is delivering packages because he has a knack for remembering employees names and faces and mentally charting where to find people in the Yammer office . <p> Hack Day , however , is not a typical day . Technically , its more like three days , but they 're still unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here 's what happens : the people who build Yammer stop doing their formal jobs and spend two days working on creative improvements to the product . Its a way to drive innovation and provide a platform for our in-house talent to flourish . <p> In Pauls case , he had an idea for a project that he wanted to create and present at Hack Day : a visual heat map of the office that illustrated which employees received the most packages . He had all of the information he needed , there was just one obstacle : he had no experience or training at creating a page like that . He had not taken any classes about coding or worked on any coding projects . <p> " Hack Days a good motivator to keep active , but the whole point for me was to learn about it and the learn the process . " Paul said . " This looks interesting and I 'm willing to learn it . Being in this environment and having people that can help me while I got into it was great . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational for me . " <p> For the other hackers , the formal work week was only two days long , but Paul couldnt take time away from his facilities position and still had to fulfill all the responsibilities of his 8-to-5 job . Once his work was done , hed work on his hack , staying in the building until almost midnight . <p> Paul started the week with a stack of papers documenting all of the deliveries since the beginning of the year . His first step was to create a digital version of that information in an excel spreadsheet . With a little bit of help from some friends in Yammer engineering , he turned the office map into a grid , with numbered points to represent each employees desk . From there , the delivery information from the spreadsheet was translated into points on the map and the more packages a desk received , the hotter the color became . <p> here 's a screen shot of Pauls prize-winning hack : <p> When Paul presented his map on Hack Day , he was met with thundering applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Director of Product Engineering Jay Laney ) as the most addicted online shopper in the office , he also told the story of how he built his hack , starting as a blank slate on a Tuesday night and building the final product for presentation by Friday morning . <p> Pauls prize , Hackers Choice , was voted on by his fellow competitors . It was a blowout . He won because his hack was exactly the kind of idea that makes Yammer Hack Day special . <p> " I think Paul won so many of the votes because he tapped into the soul of Hack Day : He imagined something he wished could exist and he did n't  let anything get in the way of building it , " VP of Engineering and Hack Day emcee Kris Gale said . " We 've got a vision for Yammer and we feel like we 've built a team that will knock anything down that stands between us and that end state . In Pauls case , he just went for it and roped anyone he could find into giving him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We value that tenacity . " <p> Pauls story is the spirit of Yammer , especially on Hack Day . Its about imaging what kinds of improvements can be made and finding ways to bring them to life . He was n't discouraged by his lack of programming experience . Rather , he s inspired by Yammer success stories that value skill and enthusiasm more than traditional resume fodder . Particularly , Paul said he sees Yammer CTO Adam Pisoni as an example of an individual who learned new skills to achieve success in the technology industry through a non-traditional route . <p> " I 've been interested in the whole coding thing ever since I found out that our Chief Technical Officer was a high school dropout , " Paul Said . " I 've also met a bunch of other people here that do n't  have college degrees , I 've thought maybe I can get into this . " <p> Even though he was a little embarrassed by the results of Pauls project , Jay Laney knows that Hack Day is a necessary part of Yammers creative growth . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer has done that not let a lack of any technical background get in the way of their fixing something technical that bugged them , " he said . " On the other hand , he revealed my late night shopping habit to all of Yammer , so I really wish none of this had ever happened . " @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024836 @624836/ <h> Using Yammer For Events <p> By the Yammer team , on November 19 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> The real magic of enterprise social networking happens when you can use online and offline elements to augment each other . While Yammer creates a participatory environment for digital townhall events , or can even replace some digital and in-person events , have you also thought about using it for some larger-scale physical inter- and intra-company events and conferences ? For our first annual conference YamJam12 , we used Yammer to augment the in-person experience , help attendees build relationships , encourage thought-provoking discussions , communicate with attendees and encourage retention and sharing of content . <h> Have a purpose and an exit plan <p> This should be fairly obvious , but before launching any community , you need to figure out what this community will do , whom it will serve and how , how success will be measured , etc . Our YamJam12 community was designed to serve registered attendees , and we opened it up to a few virtual attendees who could n't join us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantly , you will need to know what happens to the community after the event is over by deciding this before you invite people in , you 'll be able to manage expectations . Will you keep it open or shut it down ; for how long after the event will it remain open ? Who will look after it ? <p> Remember that a community is a living organism , not a static document . While it has great informational value , a community should n't be approached as a broadcast platform rather one to help its participants connect on shared values and co-create experiences . <h> Have community managers <p> Even though event-based communities can feel transient , they still require active community management . Without it , you face the risk of a languishing , anemic community that wont reach its potential , and even pose a brand risk . A good community manager will ensure that people are deriving value , meeting each other , and that conversations stay productive . The community manager will also establish a transition plan to migrate members to permanent communities after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes work and understanding of human dynamics and value systems . Ideally , itd be someone who knows your company and your community well . <p> Its always helpful to recruit an unofficial community manager ( or a few ) from the community , to partner with the official community manager . Sometimes , you will make a formal ask , and sometimes this person(s) will emerge . We have found this approach extremely effective ; in the past , we 've approached community members to become unofficial community managers and lead discussions leading up to the event . For YamJam12 , we had a couple of members who took on this role unofficially . <h> Integrate into signup experience <p> One of the most important steps to a successful community is member vetting and timing of entrance . Whom will you invite and when ? Give the community a few weeks to congeal before the big event , but keep in mind that invitations too far ahead of time may cause the " empty bar " problem . <p> Build invitations into your process from the beginning , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically loading registrants vs. asking them to join after registration . Leverage all the channels at your disposal : email , social , inclusion on the event landing page , and even physical signage . Whether you invite registrants through a digital or a physical channel , do some campaigning and let people know the benefits to them . <p> For YamJam12 , we automatically loaded all registrants . While this reduced friction of clicking the " Join " button , we wouldve seen higher engagement if members chose to join the community themselves . <h> Design an onboarding experience <p> What will people see when they first come into the community ? - Think through the information you need to serve them , as well as the actions you would want them to take . Depending on the flow of new joiners , you may want to welcome people , ask them to introduce themselves and point them to the right resources . These are the resources we developed with the YamJam12 community : <p> A welcome Note that giving a rundown of all the groups you created helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups they need . <p> Stating the community purpose , expectations and TOS in your usage policy and info tab puts it front and center and helps people adhere to desired behaviors . <p> A custom masthead with the YamJam12 design provided visual consistency with the website and other materials . <p> Featured documents in the side bar allow for easy at-a-glance reference . <p> Connecting apps and integrations that make sense helps people get the most out of the platform . <p> Seed content : - give people something to read and do when they first enter the community . Put them in the right groups and state explicitly the purpose for each group . <h> Create structure without stifling <p> You need to design your community thoughtfully , thinking through the different spaces that will help people find each other and the content they are looking for . As you create groups , be careful to not over-engineer , so that people do n't  feel like the community is their own . You do n't  want people to come into an " empty bar " , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell them where to sit . Ask yourself what the points of common interest and informational needs are . When creating groups , make sure the purpose for each group is clear . In the YamJam12 network , we created : <p> Groups for each of the conference tracks : Prior to the event , these groups served as informational platforms including sessions and information about speakers . During the event , attendees " live-yammed " things they found interesting , spurring discussion . Additionally , we kept Notes to capture all the knowledge shared during the sessions for reference later . <p> Private session groups : To encourage speakers usage of Yammer , we created private groups to collaborate on the content of sessions and panels . Groups were also used to collect PowerPoint slides and distribute speaker-specific information . <p> San Francisco group helped out-of-town attendees learn more about the city , plan their sightseeing and meals , and help people get together in an informal way . <p> A general " What is YamJam ?

To that end , design pre-event experiences that help people flex their muscles .

Before people know and trust each other , they wo n't want to ask and answer really deep questions . Build up to that trust with simple , easy questions that everyone can answer without fear of being judged by strangers . In the week leading up to YamJam12 , we asked folks to : <p> Introduce themselves and tell others where they were coming from <p> Post their favorite / most bizarre Halloween costume , and <p> Share a photo of what they are packing into their suitcase . <p> After people know each other , they will be able to really build value together , like this : <h> Provide unique experiences and exclusive content <p> Nobody wants to join yet another network that duplicates other experiences and copies over content available elsewhere . Think of things you can do exclusively in this community , such as : <p> Special events ( YamJams , contests , exclusive content available only in this space ) <p> Access to speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ability to influence some part of the conference plan an unconference , design something , name a session , provide feedback to speakers on content to be included <h> During the event : the nitty-gritty <p> The big day is finally here ! This is a great opportunity to help people get excited and capture the excitement in real-time . For maximum impact , do the following during the event : <p> Use other mediums to promote the community . Include signage at the event , big screens with displays , leaflets . Encourage all staff to let attendees know that this community exists . <p> Have Yammerfall displayed in common areas to pique interest and encourage joining the discussion . Considering displaying the main feed during keynotes and in common areas , and feeds from breakout sessions during sessions . <p> Prep speakers and ask them to mention Yammer groups at the beginning of their sessions .

While the event is still fresh in attendees minds , collect feedback about what worked and what did n't  around the event itself and the event community . Use the community to communicate post-event recaps , deliver attendee surveys ; use photos and videos to help people relive their experience together after they leave the event .

@@12024848 @624848/ <p> Deploying a successful enterprise social network requires a holistic plan that not only focuses on deploying the new technology , but also on the human aspect of the cultural change it entails . With the proliferation of social media tools in the consumer space , most users find it very easy to understand Yammer and how to use it . Even so , there could be some hesitation by users to leverage an enterprise social network if they are unclear on how the organization itself is embracing it , - how they are expected to use it on a daily basis and the benefits they will achieve from it . Over the many successful deployments of Yammer , we have gained insights into the ingredients for success . Success should be defined by every organization to align to its own strategic objectives at the outset ; what we define as success is meeting and exceeding these predefined success metrics laid out by each customer . <p> While specifics differ across customers , all successful deployments have included the following steps in common : <p> Define and communicate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new platform supports the Companys core values , mission and stratetic objectives . In addition , employees- must have a clear understanding of how it will help them acheive their own day-to-day goals . <p> Define success metrics up front . In order to design the right strategy to achieve your vision , you need to have a way to measure success . Success metrics serve as markers and will provide crucial information on how to adjust the tactics and strategy . <p> Create awareness to increase adoption <p> Form a coalition across different business groups to champion this vision . Identifying internal influencers and partners allows you to drive excitement that leads to greater adoption . These partners should include both , executives from different parts of the Company , as well as respected non-executives who can motivate through informal authority . <p> Have an official launch event to build excitement and to provide next steps on how to use the network . A launch event focuses the initial adoption , which creates a momentum that leads to greater adoption and modeling of desired behaviors . Follow it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users and to remind exisiting users of its power . <p> Reduce obstacles for adoption <p> Identify groups and users that have use cases that can benefit the most from the Enterprise Social Network . This discovery process allows you to find users that are ready to adopt and quickly buy into the vision . <p> Enable all your users to use the network . You may focus on specific use cases , but should expect for voluntary adoption by other users to lead to unexpected new use cases . Integrating the platform with existing tools , such as Sharepoint , also reduces obstacles for adoption . <p> Seed the network with useful information to quickly show value to users . ESNs are only as valuable as the information that users can get from it . With a critical mass of activity , static information will morph into conversations . <p> Provide targeted training . Because your users have different levels of understanding , addressing specific needs with the right information will increase adoption . Some common user levels include executives , power users , champions and new users . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull in others . A fully utilized network encourages top-down , bottom-up and horizontal communication. - Champions should include executives and non-executive users , in order to encourage 360-degree communication . <p> Nudge people by utilizing different tactics . For example use the Praise feature to publicly recognize people , publicly @ mention users with questions , help connect people to experts . After you 've done that , get out of the way and let them carry on the conversation . <p> Convert new users to power users , power users to champions . Everyone has the chance to be a champion , but their journey may be different. - Providing targeted support will help them on that journey . <p> Learn from your users <p> Follow up with users to identify new use cases and best practices . Our many customers have allowed us to work together to define common best practices . However , you organization is unique , and your specific goals and circumstances should be taken into account . Keeping in touch with your users will alert you to some creative use cases that you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you learn . Establishing specific metrics of success - is crucial to understanding if you are meeting - your goals . If something is not working , be flexible to course correct based on your learnings . Also , understand that your organization is not static either ; there are new objectives , new challenges , new employees , new use cases . Build in flexibility to monitor , reassess and act . <p> Back to you reader ! How do you ensure success in deploying a successful Enterprise Social Network ?

It takes more self-confidence and humility than many are comfortable with , but the payoffs are so worth it , and I 've discovered that a Yammer network is an ideal venue for exercising it . <p> When you do n't  know enough about a subject , think you know enough but are n't  quite sure , or think you may have incorrect knowledge , the best way to get the people who do know the truth is to either admit that you know nothing or proclaim what you do know , but purposefully spin it to be slightly or completely incorrect .

The most important thing it does is show others that you are interested in the facts and are open to criticism . <p> The example that prompted me to write this post was even more basic . I stumbled across something I should have found on my first day at Yammer , instead of a month later . Exposing this fact started a conversation that revealed others in the company were mostly unaware of the resource , and this realization caused us to make it more visible .

@@12024851 @624851/ <h> Community Management In Nascent Internal Communities <p> By the Yammer team , on September 12 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> In a post last week , I explored the success characteristics necessary for an internal community manager . Although these skills and traits apply to all internal community managers across the board , there are some differences that are dictated by the maturity of your network . In this follow-up post , I 'm going to explore traits that are necessary for building out a nascent community . Even though a nascent community does n't  yet produce a lot of volume , do n't  make the mistake of assuming that you do n't  need to invest the time and effort into it ; your community manager is going to be more of a builder , whose job it is to build and sustain engagement . If you are at the point of building out your Yammer community , you are probably in the process of just starting to roll out Yammer ( or will be soon ) . Make sure to check out these tips on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community manager is a key part . Heres what this community builder will need to do : <p> Find allies : Since you are just starting out , you need to lobby internally to get the support you need . But do n't  do it alone ; - find likeminded individuals who can become your allies . They may be on your team at first , and then you will be able to expand to other departments and business units and make it a truly cross-functional effort . When selecting these early allies , approach those who share your vision and passion for the " Open Enterprise . " Also , make sure to approach those stakeholders who stand the most to gain from the effort . Once the effort is up and running , collect successes ( qualitative and quantitative ) and share them with others . The best way to get support is to help people do their jobs and look like rockstars in front of their peers . <p> Get exec buy-in : Getting exec buy-in early is critical ; presence of executives legitimizes the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered part of the job , as well as setting the expectation to be on their best behavior , as " the bosses are watching . " - For example , a " plug " from the AAA COO really gave their network a shot of virtual adrenaline in the arm . <p> Define strategy , policy and governance:If you are just starting out , you will need to clearly outline the vision and goal of the network , tie it to existing business processes , align the stakeholders , establish policy and governance . When writing the policy , ensure that the right people have a seat at the table ( HR , IT , CIO ) , but do n't  go into " analysis paralysis . " When defining governance and best practices , focus on what 's appropriate and is n't and focus on " dos " vs. " donts . " <p> Seed the community with the right people . Those early users should be passionate about your shared vision , be genuinely interesting and knowledgeable and possess the necessary etiquette . They will set the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be practiced later , so make sure you pick the right people and ask them to help you create ( or at least validate ) your plan . <p> Create conversations:When your community is still new ( and even after its matured ) , you will need to consistently and proactively create conversations . This is where being knowledgeable about trends is useful ; starting conversations around industry events / competitive happenings is a great way to get the conversation started . When a great point is raised , make sure to draw people in to respond and do n't  be afraid to do it in other channels , like phone or a cubicle pop-in = This is where being well-networked becomes useful . <p> Focus on being useful : Communities- are like nightclubs . You could have the most handsome design with the snazziest features , but if no one is there , people will leave . Or you could have folks show up on the opening night , with much fanfare , and never come back . Just like a nightclub , building your community is a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people will come , but how do you get the first people into your virtual " club " This is why seeding your communities with the right people in the beginning is so important . To attract others , your content needs to : 1 ) help people do their jobs , 2 ) be useful in realtime ( have enough people responding to each other to get results ) , 3 ) be useful via archives and 4 ) connect emotionally . Think emotion has no place in the workplace ? Think again ! Stories of success resonate the best , since they help us envision success . People love to share stories as well , as it helps them be seen as an expert . <p> Promote in other channels : When you first launch the network company-wide , many people wont know what Yammer is . You may have to figure out how to promote it in other channels : in email newsletters , via your Intranet , physical flyers . Why not highlight some of the most interesting content tidbits to show people what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , check out the example of promotion on the company Intranet from customer Teekay . <p> Train , support and be a resource : As the " community gardener , " you need to continuously water the plants your community members . Train people properly ; let them know what your vision is , allow them to envision using it for their own success . Establish and share best practices , give people encouragement and be there as a resource . People want to do the right thing , but sometimes they may not know how ; its your job to help them . <p> Integrate business processes : Every company has its own way of doing things . You need to define what online networking and collaboration means to you , and which existing processes it plugs into. - Whatever your particular scenario is whether crisis communication , crowdsourcing ideas , onboarding , sales or support enablement think through the steps necessary , and the people you need to call on to make it successful . <p> Back to you , reader !

The API enables developers to build applications on top of Yammer and integrate Yammer into users existing tools and workflows . <p> With the release of the API , Yammer users should soon expect to have many of the same applications already available to users of other services such as Twitter . <p> In fact , Seesmic , developer of the popular desktop client , twhirl , has already announced that it would use the API to add Yammer support in the coming weeks . This will allow twhirl users to post status updates to either Yammer or Twitter from a single place . <p> The API will also facilitate the development of new productivity tools and the integration of Yammer with project management systems like Trac . <p> Yammers API offers much of the functionality available to users through a web browser . This includes access not just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features such as tags , threaded discussions , and a company directory . <p> The API mirrors the security settings on the Yammer website . It supports SSL , and network administrators can block access to the API if the user tries to log in from outside the companys IP range . <p> Network administrators can also simply turn off the API for their network if they do not want to permit third-party applications . <p> The coming weeks should prove to be very exciting as developers start to release applications built with the Yammer API . <p> For more information about the Yammer API , please visit the Yammer API page . @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024856 @624856/ <h> Red Light , Green Light and Engaging Employees in your Network <p> Remember the childhood game of Red Light , Green Light ? You designated one person to be the " stop light " and the rest to try and touch or pass the " stop light . " <p> This game can apply to Enterprise Social networks by replacing the stop-light with the network you 're using : Yammer . The players in this case are your employees . This simple analogy enables you to designate your employees to three categories : red dot , yellow dot or green dot . The beauty of this approach is that its not just applicable to social networking , its applicable to any technology or process that you implement for your company . <p> Green dots are the employees who- are most motivated for change . They evangelize the change , are energized by the possibility , and help set you up for success . They are your champions and help drive forward the endeavor . They inevitably become your power users . They are the ones who- are running to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are n't  quite ready for change , but are n't  completely adverse to it either . They are the- contributors to your network and help to provide content but do n't  become highly engaged . Theyll passively consume information . They are the ones who- slow down and take everything in . <p> Red dots are those who resist and do n't  adapt well to change , they are your challengers . They wo n't budge from their standpoint and believe that what 's worked in the past is the best to continue with in the future . Typically , these employees have been with the company for a long time , they 're the ones who vocalize loudest that your changes wont benefit the company . Red dots sound like they could stunt your network , but recognizing them is your first step to success . Every change that occurs will have someone who- does n't  believe its necessary . Without this opposition , we 'd actually never have positive change . Challengers ensure that you 're taking all aspects into consideration , including what 's worked in the past and what you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your network by ensuring you set realistic goals . They are n't  necessary stopping , but rather pausing to take in what you 're doing and raising concerns . <p> As you begin the implementation , look to your champions ( green dots ) to help raise awareness about the change . They can help move your contributors to more active participants of the network and include challengers fears and concerns in your initial plan . <p> In the case of New Signature , we were very similar to most organizations . While we believe highly in test driving technology , we also have challengers and those who do n't  see the benefit of certain changes . Our CEO , Christopher Hertz , was a self-proclaimed red dot during our initial Yammer push . He held the same fears that many red dots do : its another place to look for information , we 've been successful thus far without Yammer and he did n't  see the business use cases . We followed a similar approach to our network : focus on our champions and contributors . <p> Our champions brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the workplace . Our contributors provided new ideas , they participated in YamJams ( Yammer town halls ) and they asked questions. - As the network grew , it became clear that Yammer was helping to break down walls that had been in place , but were not yet- acknowledged. - Our YamJams grew from only five participants to 22 within a month and activity grew from 20 messages to 116 . These YamJams were held weekly with a different Executive Team member to enable the company to learn about each , ask questions and increase lines of communication . Because of this push , we were able to convert our biggest challenger into our biggest champion . He saw the benefits of Yammer first hand and realized this would transform our business and increase employee engagement . <p> Do we still have challengers with our network ? Of course ! But we embrace them more now , they help to ensure were keeping the network business focused and using it to have meaningful conversations . I do n't  think a network ever truly removes all challengers but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and including them as your network develops . <p> " AJ Shortlidge , @ajshortlidge @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024862 @624862/ <h> Employee Engagement Drives Customer Advocacy And Business Value <p> By the Yammer team , on May 25 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> These days , a brand voice is a composite of how customers , employees and the rest of the ecosystem feel about the brand . Social media has given a voice to many employees , and these empowered employees now want something bigger than being a proverbial cog in a wheel . These empowered employees , driven by purpose and passion , can be true brand advocates and radically improve both : the top and bottom line. - To do so , these employees have to be committed to the organization and its goals . This commitment is also known as engagement and is a source of enduring competitive advantage . Here are just a few reasons why engaged employees are simply good for business . <p> Engaged and informed employees are a source of knowledge . " People establish significant , visible expertise through their employment , " says Brian Kotlyar of Dachis Group . Your employees know what they are doing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership. - Buyers are n't  content with buying simple widgets anymore ; they are looking for an expert partner . To fully maximize the exposure of your employees expertise to the rest of the world , give them the tools to keep up to date and hone their skills , and empower them to offer these resources to those in need . <p> Engaged employees produce . Every CEO has a vision ; the challenge is to enable and inspire employees to carry out this vision . This task is made more difficult by employees reduced dependence on company resources to develop their careers . If you engage your employees and help them feel that they can contribute the companys goals , they will be more likely to be loyal to you and use discretionary effort vs. just scraping by and watching the clock . <p> Engagement leads to higher stock price . We already established that employee engagement drives customer advocacy and engagement , as well as cuts costs . It shouldnt come as a surprise that all of this- ultimately drives higher revenues , profits and thus stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most engaged companies have 5 times higher total shareholder return over 5 years than the least engaged companies . A study by Towers Perrin similarly linked employee engagement to a 6% higher net-profit margins , and a Aon Hewitt tied high- levels of engagement ( 65% or greater ) to outperforming the total stock market index and posting total shareholder returns 22% higher than average in 2010 . <p> Its clear at this point that engaged employees not only advocate for the brand and turn customers into advocates , but also deliver hard financial metrics . Jack Welch , the CEO of General Electric , summed it up nicely : <p> " Any company trying to compete must figure out a way to engage the mind of every employee . " <p> Since engagement has such measurable positive effects , one would think that all companies have learned to harness it and appreciate it , right ? Wrong ! here 's a snapshot of where we currently are with engagement : <p> Workers are largely unengaged : According to a Gallup poll , 71% of employees are unengaged or actively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged employees are committed to the company and its goals , why are most employees just waiting to jump ship ? - According to a- 2011 Careerbuilder.com report , " 76% of full-time workers , while not actively looking for a new job , would leave their current workplace if the right opportunity came along . " - Other studies show that each year , the average company loses anywhere from 20% to 50% of its employee base . <p> Given how important employee engagement is to meeting business objectives , yet how disengaged employees feel , there seems to be a major disconnect . In the next post , well answer the question " What drives employee engagement ? " and help you find ways to ensure that your employees feel engaged and inspired to advocate on your behalf .

The team was looking for a way to share experiences , challenges , opportunities and relationships with other organizations to make the campaign more efficient and to grow . Introducing and emphasizing a culture different from the parent company ( WWF ) was a key consideration as well ( Earth Hour is a non-profit collaboration between WWF , Leo Burnett and Fairfax Media ) . <p> The Results : <p> " Yammer has revolutionized how the campaign is working , " shared Andy .

As a result , have you ever felt excluded , unappreciated or undervalued ? Or perhaps you 've been on the other end and failed to communicate properly for fear of alarming people and getting negative feedback ? Ive been at both ends , and I am here to tell you that , though frightening , it is better to over-communicate than under-communicate . <p> Ask for help <p> Everyone and I mean everyone likes to have his or her opinion heard . Why not tap into that desire ? Sure , some of the opinions and feedback might be less than constructive , but there also will be some hidden gems that you would have never considered otherwise . I will be the first to admit that I am guilty of trying to take on too much by myself , and not asking for help from others as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer to improve our overall collaboration and engagement ( not to mention I was leading the effort ) , I truly began to recognize the value and power of information sharing and working out loud . <p> Sharing is caring <p> We have three different office locations , with developers of different levels and areas of expertise spread across all three . Since we launched our network as the go-to place for collaborating and communicating , the greatest #yamwin ( we use this word to refer to business successes facilitated by Yammer ) I have seen is when developers post a question to their corresponding group and within minutes , they receive a response . Their colleagues are able to help hammer through the development question much like they would on Stack Overflow except for this time , all of the questions and answers are retained on our internal network for reference in the future . In the past , developers would have to walk to each others desks or search on the Internet for the answer . This method answered their question , but knowledge was forever lost into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With an ESN tool , we are able to create a wiki and revisit that feed whenever needed . <p> The human side of executive communication <p> In working with executives , I have found that even though many are open to their employees collaborating and communicating , they are still hesitant to do the same themselves . Perhaps they are afraid that if they show vulnerability , people wont respect them as much , wont appear as powerful . The corporate ladder keeps executives safe from judgment , and utilizing a tool like Yammer compromises that safety . What most do n't  realize is that open communication actually makes leaders more powerful and influential . <p> Employees feel like an asset , not an expense line item when they see the human side of their executives ; when a member of the C-suite reaches out to a regular employee , this employee feels heard . By commenting and openly discussing something , execs can help their troops feel more bought-in . Even a simple comment or " like " can go a long way never underestimate the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting viewpoints and solutions from across the company is a powerful executive decision-making tool . Any time our CEO makes a post or asks for help , he is the most replied to member for that day he is our leader , and we are his a team . If he has an idea or asks for help , we feel a sense of community by working together to execute on that idea or resolve a challenge . <p> This sense of community and open communication does n't  happen overnight . Our network is working every day on improving the level of transparency . Once you embrace the idea that communication is not a four-letter word , I dare you to see how far it can take you . The possibilities are endless and your organization will only benefit as a result . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024871 @624871/ <h> Big Pharma Gets Social With Yammer , Part 1 <p> By the Yammer team , on July 15 , 2013May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> One of the first verticals to adopt Yammer , enterprise social continues to grow and thrive in the pharmaceutical industry . This has been a dynamic development for a knowledge-based industry that is historically security driven and compliance heavy . <p> We asked several prominent pharmaceutical companies , including Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb , with active Yammer networks how they have balanced the risks and rewards of Enterprise Social Networking ( ESN ) and set out to evaluate how ESN has enabled agility at three stages of the drug development lifecycle : designing ; manufacturing ; and selling . <p> New Challenges <p> Since 2009 , changing market dynamics have presented new challenges to the pharmaceutical industry . In a June 19 , 2013 report by CBS Atlanta , a Mayo Clinic research study revealed that " nearly 70 percent of Americans are on at least one prescription drug , and more than half receive at least two prescriptions . " Additionally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one prescription drug in the past month increased nearly 50 percent between 2007 and 2010 . " With these numbers continuing to increase , there 's little question that pharmaceutical companies face a tremendous challenge to supply consumer demand . <p> Pharmaceutical companies , however , are being squeezed from multiple angles . Governments are increasing pressure on areas such as pricing , higher domestic costs are driving a move towards outsourcing , and loss of sales on patented products have decreased funds . <p> An additional challenge has been slower innovation , with fewer new products in the pipeline . This has become a key point of differentiation in the agile biotech environment where the speed of innovation is fast not only across drug development , but across the biotech industry as a whole . In an attempt to recreate this , big pharma companies are shifting their approach . In some cases they have created smaller internal R&amp;D groups which are based around a product and must compete for funding . As part of these changes , enterprise social networking is playing a pivotal role in helping pharma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sales and marketing . Let 's take a closer look at each of these areas . <p> DesigningPharmaceuticals R&amp;D <p> Sales of legacy , blockbuster patented products are decreasing and traditional product areas have become saturated . With shrinking profits , pharmaceutical companies are doing more with less . At the same time , this is driving change in the way R&amp;D is being done . Through the use of enterprise social networking , some pharma companies have succeeded in doing more with less and in applying the agile methods of the biotech industry . <p> We asked Tom Hill , Service Manager of Internal Social Media at Bristol-Myers Squibb , about Yammers impact in the area of R&amp;D , and he responded that , " It can be problematic for large R&amp;D organizations to quickly share information across teams involved in the different stages of drug development using traditional tools like email . Bristol-Myers Squibb uses private Yammer groups to increase transparency and alignment within cross-matrix drug development teams . " <p> With respect to users within Bristol-Myers Squibb having transparent access to relevant information , Tom added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a group , individuals from multiple teams involved in different stages of the drug development process are able to quickly share information . " <p> Making Pharmaceuticals Operations and Manufacturing <p> In the pharmaceuticals industry , change and flux are constants due to frequent mergers &amp; acquisitions ( M&amp;A ) and product licensing deals . In this ever-evolving environment , agility in responding to a merger and acquisition or licensing agreements is essential . If navigated successfully , M&amp;A events can help a pharma company build more pipeline , diversify products , and expand its technology base . With enterprise social networking , merging companies can integrate more quickly , both organizationally and culturally , accelerating the time to value of an M&amp;A or licensing event . <p> Reducing the number of emails and meetings was an early win associated with Yammer use . Tom Hill noted that Yammer helps accomplish these goals for teams at Bristol-Myers Squibb , " This sharing of information also facilitates offline discussions that help reduce the number of meetings needed by these teams . " <p> At an operations level , leadership teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , a senior operations executive at a global pharmaceutical company uses the Yammer mobile app to post messages to his team when he is out of the office , letting him stay connected to his team , better understand their challenges and concerns , and apply this insights to improving operations- This tighter connection to leadership is something employees welcome as well . <p> At Sanofi UK and Ireland , Yammer is used to facilitate engagement and garner support for a new regional alignment strategy . Communication in the Sanofi UK and Ireland network enables team members to provide feedback on the new strategy and suggest actionable improvements that can make an impact across the organization . As Ian OHare , Head of Internal Communications at Sanofi UK and Ireland points out , " Yammer has added the conversation to our internal communication approach . We encourage everyone to discuss what we have published which has led to real engagement on important issues which have driven employee led change . Whilst its early days there is common agreement that Yammer has made a real difference to the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share best practice into their manufacturing processes . They are using Yammer to engage their employees around this new way of thinking and to educate workers at the plants . Plans are now in place to link up their manufacturing excellence teams , facilitating sharing of best practices across their manufacturing sites . The mobile nature of Yammer allows even those on the ground to participate and feedback on where they see inefficiencies , sending them back to the group to effectively solve the problems in a much faster way . <p> At another global pharma company , Yammer is being used by its European Leadership Committee . The company previously held three-hour town hall meetings , which required two days travel by regional leaders to attend the event in person . Now , the company holds the town meeting over the course of an hour using Yammer , resulting in significant financial savings in both executive time and travel costs . <p> By now , you 've seen how Yammer and enterprise social networking are changing the way pharmaceutical companies do business at the R&amp;D and operations levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how enterprise social networking is impacting sales and marketing in big pharma . <p> This post was co-authored by Daniel Brunt and Emma Stephen : <p> Daniel Brunt is a Senior Customer Success Manager at Yammer .

@@12024874 @624874/ <h> No Company Email ? No Problem ! <p> By the Yammer team , on September 3 , 2013June 28 , 2017 0Shares <p> Can you honestly say , without a doubt , that your entire company is connected and communicating effectively ? Very often , depending on how your business is organized , the answer is no . Many organizations operate with large , detached , and dispersed workforces on the frontlines ( hourly or kiosk employees , field or production workers , or even contractors ) . These employees can be the hardworking retail associates , servers , and cashiers of your organization that are on the frontline selling , serving , and helping your customers day in and day out . <h> A Disconnected Workforce <p> Despite the fact that these employees are the closest to customers , they are often times the most disconnected from the organization , with no channel to share feedback with headquarters or team members . There are a number of challenges that companies with a large field operation face , such as : communication issues , an inability to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the entire organization , and high turnover . - It is n't easy for these workers at the frontline either . They often suffer from low job satisfaction , lack of recognition from management , difficulties with schedule and shift coordination , and a lack of context about how their work impacts the broader objectives of the organization . <h> Empowering the Frontline <p> But their voices need to be heard . These workers understand how to best serve the customer as well as often see the challenges and issues that can affect your business at the core . Moreover , these employees will often have ideas and solutions that can save the organization time and money , and at times reduce risk . <p> To connect these workers with the rest of the organization , Yammer has developed an integration called " Users Without Emails . " This capability enables companies to include all members of their organization on Yammer , without requiring a corporate email account . Yammer can unify your workforce and align your existing systems across geographies and functions . It can be the connective tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their jobs . <p> A number of Yammer customers are already benefiting from this integration , such as Kroger and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers . The CEO of Red Robin , Stephen Carley , clearly understands the value of direct feedback from frontline workers . <h> Creating an Open Workplace <p> Yammer is on a mission to create an open and connected workplace enabling companies to bring their entire workforce together . Your companys network works best when it connects everyone in your organization , including frontline workers who typically have the most interaction with customers . As the pace of change and information increases , the companies that connect all of their employees are going to be the ones in the best position to respond to evolving customer needs , technology innovations , and other changes in the market . If you are interested in learning about how to connect your employees who may not have corporate emails with the rest of your organization on Yammer , you can contact us for more information . <h> Top 4 Takeaways : <p> 2 ) An agile company must make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand , and values of the company . As a result this can increase employee retention and improve company operations . <p> 3 ) Frontline workers are typically the main point of contact for customers , therefore they are the employees - who need to be empowered to effectively communicate and make decisions . <p> 4 ) Schedules for frontline workers vary by season , schedule , and position Give them the ability to stay connected and engaged . <p> Do you have examples of how your company or team has benefited from connecting with your frontline workers ?

Participants faced the daunting task of either gaining executive sponsorship or paying out of pocket to attend . So , with little more than two months until the event , I took on the challenge to break down the conference walls so those who could not afford to attend the live event could still participate and benefit . <p> Enter Yammer . With the enterprise social networking tool , we were able to extend the conference to the roughly 1,000 additional virtual participants ! <p> While planning for this event , I discovered that Yammer was not just a place to share information about the conference it was a way to virtualize the event itself . This addresses the most common question faced by every hosting committee , regardless of subject matter : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participant experience ? <h> Extending the Experience <p> An enterprise social network like Yammer provides a space for attendees to connect prior to the conference , gives them access to pertinent information throughout the event , and allows them to continue the conference beyond the closing keynote . In turn , the network provides a unified conference management environment for the host committee to collaborate , discuss , and share conference-related materials . <h> How to Use Yammer for Events <h> Before the Event <p> Ensure a positive experience by communicating early , and invite participants to the enterprise social network prior to the event . Consider integrating registration into the tool and have a booth at sign-in to walk participants through the network interface and key groups . <p> Set up conference related groups that attendees can find upon entering the network . Examples include groups for Conference Schedules , Conference Announcements , and Break-out Sessions where attendees can access calendars and presentations , discuss sessions , and connect with other attendees . <h> During the Event <p> While at the conference , attendees , speakers , committee members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and share a workspace . Allow these network members to create their own networking groups for relevant topics , alma maters , or committees that are utilizing the conference to work together . <h> Post-Event and Beyond <p> The conference does n't  have to end just because the event has finished . Continue the conference by keeping the network open for attendees to reconnect with each other , locate that keynote presentation they forgot to take with them , and most importantly , share feedback about the conference . <p> You know you 've nailed it if the community remains active after the event , so its important to have a game plan for your post-conference interactions &amp; communications . Consider how you will handle conversations specific to your product , industry , company , and prepare information that can be shared with customers or a wider audience . <p> To sum up how powerful using an onsite and online approach to host a conference , here 's a quote to inspire : " This was the best conference that I did n't  even attend " <p> imagine the possibilities !

To help , we 've put together six ways you can use Yammer to become an inspiring , strong and memorable leader . <p> 1 . Take a Poll Nothing is more presidential than voting , so ask a group in your network to help you by lending their vote on a poll . All you have to do is click on " Post a Poll , " ask your question , list the answer options and notify important individuals . For extra president points , you can even campaign for one of the options with posters , debates and speeches . <p> 2 . Create a GroupIts kind of like creating your own caucus to delegate . You get to decide what the Group is about and invite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights to manage the content and membership , and if you build it right , it can help you accomplish more faster . In an extreme way , its like appointing yourself president of a country that you created and only your friends live there . <p> 3 . Post an Announcement- Group admins have the authority to publish Announcements , which appear on a group feed just like a regular post , except they have a title and are marked as " Announcements . " Its similar to delivering a State of the Union speech , only you do n't  have to stop for all the applause breaks . <p> 4 . Expand Your Base Presidents are constantly looking for new people to influence , so look outside of your inner circle and read up on a Group that you 're not a part of. - It never hurts to find out more about the other parts of your network . You might just find a new way to pitch in . <p> 5 . Fill Out Your Cabinet Do you have a person in your network who is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak Japanese or edit photos ? Your colleagues should- list their personal interests and areas of expertise in their profile , so you can use Yammer to search for coworkers with specific skills . The actual president does n't  have a Secretary of SharePoint , but that does n't  mean you cant . <p> 6 . Praise SomeoneWhen you finish a project , give credit to the people who helped using Yammers Praise features . All you have to do is click on " Praise Someone , " select whom you 're praising and explain how they helped . Its a nice way to know that even if you 're running the show , you could n't do it without the help of your teammates . <p> For now there 's no way to kiss babies using Yammer , but new updates are always being made , so you never know what 's next . If you 're feeling extra presidential , there 's no better place to celebrate presidents than at this years SharePoint Conference . <p> How do you plan to be more presidential in your network ?

This can be challenging in large organizations where staff are scattered across the globe and functional groups . It can be equally challenging for small organizations where staff are stretched to the limit with a variety of tasks and duties . <p> This is exactly where we , as an organization , found ourselves in January 2009 . Were The National Society of Collegiate Scholars ( NSCS ) , a nonprofit honor society for high-achieving first- and second-year college students ; we have a staff of 20+ in Washington , D.C. with a few commuters scattered across the country. - Every person on our staff is so committed to and engaged in his/her work that it is often difficult to know what people in other departments are working on . <p> Enter Yammer in January 2009 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" ) or updates from trainings ( " here 's an additional document to supplement the training you participated in " ) . <p> Fun Yam : <p> But over time , Yammer became a community for staff to share their successes , stories and more . Here are some examples <p> The communications department would share a link to a story they placed in a local newspaper . <p> The chapter managers would share a highlight of a great service event that one of their chapters held : <p> Our online community manager showcased the best tweets , Facebook posts and comments from our other social media tools . <p> I even mentioned to staff on Yammer last Friday that I might be working on a blog post/case study for this Yammer blog ! Does it get much more meta than that ? <p> The sharing of these highlights and stories not only kept us in the loop , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond positively to your work is a great feeling and seeing a thread of those responses is even better . <p> Today , any NSCS staff member knows and can easily recount what other departments are working on and highlight others news and achievements . Yammer is also a fantastic culture-builder , serving as a great space not only to share successes , but also employees non-work selves . Just about every employee can tell you their employees favorite books and even desserts . <p> Here are some clear business successes that Yammer has helped NSCS achieve : <p> Improved collaboration among staff members on various projects and programs . <p> Reduced e-mail clutter by at least 15 percent , also reducing time that employees spend reviewing emails . Now a lot of our full-staff e-mails have a home on Yammer . <p> Improved insight into what colleagues are working on allows staff to determine when they can reuse ideas or work products already created by staff members .

It starts to feel like the only way to get anything done is to shut ourselves out from the outside world . <p> When we start to get down to it , it seems like the majority of these requests are asking the same thing : what are you doing ? The insane thing is that these requests are n't  limited to innocent taps on the shoulder ; we get requests by phone , email , and sometimes even establish daily status meetings . All of this in an effort to establish what we and our teammates are working on . <p> You might be thinking that 's a lot of time to just tending to status updates and you are right . Luckily the team over at WorkingOn has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Yammer . <p> WorkingOn provides your team with minimalistic status reporting . Teams can communicate with each other about current projects . Each team member can post short status updates that are used to track progress . Take the opportunity to use the natural pause when switching tasks to share what you 're working on . Its much better than emails or meetings because it minimizes distraction and provides more transparency about the work being done . This saves time , keeps everyone on the same page , and increases motivation . <p> How does it work with Yammer ? <p> WorkingOn offers multiple integration options that allow it to seamlessly integrate into your teams existing workflow , including Yammer integration .

More and more companies are coming to rely on remote workers . With traditional stand-ups you are completely reliant on everyone being available at the same time . Companies often have remote workers distributed over multiple timezones around the world . This makes it next to impossible for everyone to have a morning stand-up .

Undoubtedly , our #1 request was for a Groups feature . We have listened closely to your feedback and are confident that you will find great value in the Groups feature that we have developed . <p> With Groups your Yammer network can more closely mirror the organizational structure that already exists at your company ; members and messages can be organized by groups , as opposed to the entire network . For larger companies , Groups will help surface only the content that 's most relevant to each user , further reducing noise . <p> In order to accommodate the Groups feature , we needed to update the design of Yammer . You 'll notice the new column of vertical tabs on the right hand side of the Home page dedicated to the 4 default feeds : <p> My Feed ( Replaced the Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and tags you follow , as well as the groups you join . By default , your general updates , all messages not posted to Groups , will appear in this feed . You can choose to not receive these updates by unfollowing your networks general feed by clicking the i icon on the vertical tab and disabling your networks general feed . <p> All The all feed includes all messages posted by everyone in your network , excluding private Group messages . You can view the network stats , previously located on the Home page sidebar , by clicking the i icon on this tab . <p> Received The Received feed includes any replies to your messages as well as all messages addressed to you . <p> Sent The Sent feed displays all of the messages you have posted to Yammer . <p> Additional tabs are added for each additional Group you join . <p> There are two types of Groups , private and public . Messages posted in private groups are only viewable by members of that group , and only Group Admins can invite users to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or view messages posted in public groups . <p> To post an update to a Group that you have joined , simply click the Groups vertical tab on the Home page , add your message to the update box , and click Update . <p> You can also send updates to any private Group you have joined and any public Group that you have or havent joined , via : <p> IM : start your IM with to:groupname <p> SMS : start your SMS with to:groupname <p> Email : address email to groupname@yammer.com <p> Any Client Feeds : start your update with to:groupname <p> For more information on the Groups feature , visit the Groups page in the How-To-Guide . <p> New top-level tabs for Groups and Links gives you faster access to these features . <p> In addition to the new design and the groups feature a couple of other enhancements have been added as well : <p> International SMS : The option to send messages to Yammer via SMS has always been available for US users . However , we just added the ability to send messages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30201 in the U.S. or 447786207900 internationally to post a message . <p> OAuth : Now you can log in to applications developed through the Yammer API more securely ( no need to give other applications your password ) . With this enhancement comes an Applications subtab within your settings that enables you to easily authorize or deauthorize applications . <p> Updates to our popular Desktop , Blackberry , and iPhone applications , to support these new features , will also be released . Read the release notes for the Desktop Application here . The iPhone application will be up on the iTunes store once it is approved . <p> Enter key does not submit message : This was another highly requested preference that you now have the option to enable through your Appearance settings , if you wish .

Check out their stories and pro tips : <p> I am the Marketing Manager at Rural Sourcing , Inc.s , where I oversee all external and internal marketing efforts . When my company approached me with a request to take on the additional role as Community Manager , I saw an opportunity to build a legacy I could look back on and be proud of. - As a long-time social media advocate , I immediately knew that an Enterprise Social Network would take our companys internal communications to the next level . We have now grown- from 40 to 115 members and achieved 94% engagement . - To say its been an exciting journey is an understatement . - It has created a sense of one-unified organization , though we are spread across different offices and states . <p> Ashleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to always keep in mind is to " keep it simple " ( or KISS ) . If you over-complicate a post or a response , it is very easy for something to get lost in translation . Keeping the message simple ensures that you are reaching the maximum people possible , and are more likely to receive action . <p> Guide Executives to actively engage : - - When working with execs , outline a weekly schedule . Executives time is precious ; when you give them a specific time of day to post or spend 30 minutes responding to others , they are more likely to follow through , engage , and turn the pattern into a routine . <p> Its a Marathon , not a Sprint : - The journey to network-wide adoption and engagement is a marathon , not a sprint . Some networks will catch on right away but most will need constant massaging and planning and occasional engagement events .

But when used strategically , these tools are more than just fun ; strategy helps us tie what we do into the companys business goals and accomplishments . Create a strategy for everything you do as a community manager , and make sure your activities align with and support the companys overall objectives . <p> Build relationships offline : - Being a community manager requires a lot of energy and personality , and its important to keep that energy and personality going when interacting with people in person especially if they know you are the voice behind the tools . When they interact with you in person , people are often searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know a little about a lot : As a community manager you engage in so many conversations . Some are work related , and some are not . It makes it easier to steer and participate in conversations when you have a wide breadth of knowledge to draw from . <p> My name is Lori Kasserman , and I am a corporate communicator at Southern Company , one of the largest generators of electricity in the nation . My work is focused on driving the companys use of social media and developing and delivering digital content for internal and external audiences . In addition to being the voice of the companys social accounts , I am also community manager of the companys Yammer network . <p> I have worked at Southern Company for over a decade , and Yammer is the first tool that allows employees to make connections across geographic boundaries .

I 'd also include gardening and herding as other activities Ive undertaken to get the job done ! <p> When I started at GS1 Australia , one business unit was already using Yammer ; however it was important to take a step back and align this with the business strategy prior to rolling out widely .

It does n't  matter how much planning and engagement you do , people will do things in their own way and time they need to play , learn and experience the what 's in it for me to become really engaged . <p> Remember you are not alone in your journey as a community manager .

My favourite part of the job is working with teams and individuals to talk about their workflow and goals , and then offering a solution to make them more effective and engaged in their work . My personal goal is to eliminate email within the enterprise within 5 years I believe this is possible with tools like Yammer . <p> I think many CMs start out as power users within their network , and eventually create a CM role out of that passion and interest . I just applied for a job the old-fashioned way . = I had previously been a CM in a smaller Disney segment , and was excited to see a position that did n't  tie me and my users to one solution , allowing me to work through individual teams goals and workflow to find the best solution for their unique needs <p> Jennifers tips : <p> A few things that I have learned : <p> An exec saying- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it , too . <p> A little bit of hand-holding can go a long way . <p> Conversation starters end in questions , not in statements . ( Simple , but confusing for many new users trying to get activity going in their groups ! ) <p> This Simon Sinek TED Talk- sums up the approach that I take when onboarding new users and positioning Yammer and our other social tools. - We have a big job : to change the way that people work . That 's not easy , and the excuses of " I have no time " are true . If we understand users Why , and know the benefit people will see in their workflow , productivity , and engagement at work , they be willing to learn new things and make time for them . My best tip is to understand the Why for every user , team , department , and then help them with the What and the How . <p> My name is- Angus Heslop , and I work with on strategy and marketing in the global capital markets area at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also passionate about social media and design. - On top of my normal role , I also do all the communications , design , media and marketing for the graduate cohort ( 90 graduates ) at NAB . I created this external network to give graduates a safe space to share ideas , ask dumb questions , tell stories , arrange graduate events and organise initiatives . <p> NABs uptake of Yammer has been very organic , and although we did n't  have a lot of the resources in the beginning , it has allowed us to experiment and trial new initiatives to increase Yammer engagement , some of which have been used by Yammer with other clients . <p> Angus tips : <p> I have learnt the importance of giving people very clear , easy-to-follow instructions on signing up and using Yammer . One thing we have been trialling is a 10 day plan , which is overseen by a Yammer mentor . The plan involves going through a series of Yammer milestones day-by-day signing up , following colleagues , updating a profile , liking a postand all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a few vocal and visible Yammer ambassadors to encourage other users , so its not just you as the administrator doing it all ( which has the propensity to create switch-off ) . <p> People will only go Yammer if it has interesting content ; information on Yammer must be tangible to peoples day-to-day roles for them to get online . Its not enough to have a leader talk about future strategy , because this will quickly create switch-off , it there 's no information that affects peoples day to day work lives . <p> It is crucial to have support from the top . People will be more likely to Yammer if they see their leader Yammering . This can combat negative perceptions of Yammer as Facebook for work. <p> Happy Community Manager Appreciation Day to all ! You guys are the stewards , educators , coaches , storytellers , anthropologists , curators ( and sometimes " cat herders " ) . Your sense of passion and strength to keep pushing through are amazing .

@@12024899 @624899/ <h> Try Yammer ; Maybe Youll Learn Something <p> By the Yammer team , on May 26 , 2010May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> This is a guest blog post written by Mike Petersell , Management Center for Learning &amp; Performance Director at Pitney Bowes . His team is focused on management development for the Mailing Solutions business unit . Follow Mike on Twitter or check out his personal blog . <p> Without question , Yammer is a great tool for social networking . Since we 've adopted it in Pitney Bowes , we 've seen steady , organic growth in the number of users from all parts of the organization and a proliferation of communities built around areas of common interest . But my view of Yammer is a little different . As someone who is accountable for management development , I 'm interested in its power as an engine for learning . You may find it surprising to think of Yammer as a learning tool but that 's how I see it . I scroll through a users activity stream like a miner , seeing discussion threads as veins of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gems of information ; all with the potential to help people meet their individual development needs . <p> Most of my career has been devoted to helping people meet their learning needs by meticulously analyzing those needs and addressing them through rigorous instructional design . And yet , with all the formal learning I have designed and delivered over the years , I recognize that what makes people most successful is not what they learn from the content of the programs we provide , but what they learn from one another . Do n't  get me wrong , I 'm very proud of the work that I have done and the significant impact it has had in helping people learn and grow at work . But I realize a lot of the value created in the classroom comes from the informal elements of the learning experience such as the dynamic of the group , the experiences each member brings to the table , and the tools and resources they share with one another . That is why , to me , Yammer is a learning goldmine . It enables those special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom to happen all the time . <p> Learning guru , Jay Cross , defines informal learning as , " that which enables you to participate successfully in life , at work , and in the groups that matter to you . " It is the " unofficial , unscheduled , impromptu way people learn to do their jobs . " Isnt that what Yammer provides ? Isnt it really a mechanism for unofficial , unscheduled , impromptu learning opportunities ? That is what I see when I delve into my Yammer feed . And that is what I hope others in my company will see in their feeds as well . <p> To this end , my team plays an active role in our Yammer community . We create and join groups and use hashtags to post items on topics that are important to our learners such as #managing , #leadership , #remote-management , #change , and #engagement . We encourage everyone to do the same . By sharing messages , links and attachments , we hope our employees find value when they go fishing in their activity streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast their line . But we figure , why not seed the waters ? @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024902 @624902/ <h> Social Leadership <p> By the Yammer team , on June 1 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> In my personal blog , I recently wrote a post that talked about- The " Tyranny of Knowledge " in which I shared why we are sometimes misunderstood . Today , I want to share a use case that demonstrates one way leveraging Social Business platforms can improve communications . <p> One of the biggest challenge a leader faces is they are expected to know the answers . A leader- does knowor does he/she ? Your Leadership Style <p> Let 's look at - two different approaches and decide which is likely to achieve the best results <p> Your boss tells you , " You need to work 60hr/week because there is insufficient money to hire someone else " Your reaction is you are angry or frustrated , you have no input or understanding of why you are being asked to work longer hours , or what the problem is at all , but fear asking questions because your boss has a habit of getting angry when his authority is questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you are looking for a new job and boss . <p> Now , let 's look at a different approach . <p> Your boss tells you , " We have a lot of work that is n't being done . I realize that you are working hard . We need to either work longer hours or come up with ways to make things more efficient because we do n't  have the money to hire more people . Do you have any ideas ? " . The fact you are being asked for your input ( and given a choice ) totally changes your view . More than likely you have even taken on part of this problem as your own . You may even admire and/or respect your boss for being upfront and honest with you . You may , in fact , even end up working 60hr or even 70hr weeks . <p> While the first approach may solve the problem faster , it is more than likely going to have a long term negative impact that far outweighs the upside. - What is important to note is neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second case where people are asked for input , its clear the boss still owns the decision . <p> " It is better to ask some of the questions than know all the answers . " James Thurber <h> The importance of Listening <p> I was recently in an organization where the leader declared , " 90% of your job is communications " and then proceeded to lay out a plan on how we were going to tell people what we are doing . What was missing is there was no process or activity to solicit peoples feedback . If you are not listening , then you are missing a huge opportunity to understand if people really " get " your message , or perhaps there 's valuable information they are trying to share that could impact your view . <h> The two phases of leadership communications <h> Planning/Soliciting- input <p> During this phase , you should be soliciting input from people around you ( crowdsourcing ) , leading the conversation by sharing constraints that may not be apparent , but also ensuring the comments and suggestions align to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , it will help develop the sense of urgency . Dont- just listen to the people who work for you . Listen to others that may have some perspective that may be invaluable . Its through this- serendipity that the value of- Social Business really shines . What is important is to not shut anyone down in the process , instead work to bring people to gain greater insight and perspective . All feedback is good , the perspective may not be in line with yours , but sometimes even the most irrelevant suggestions might provide value or to look at the challenge in a new way . The most important thing during this phase is to keep an open mind . Also , its important to remember people have feelings . You are trying to build a community you can rely on . You will be best served by encouraging them , not discouraging them . <h> The decision and next steps <p> We cant operate in planning stage forever . If this were the case , nothing would ever get done . Now its time to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for feedback , you communicate the decision , with as much clarity as possible and be to include- why the decision was made . This is how you are going to get people to better understand the decision and ultimately support it . Often , we may ask for feedback , and make a decision that seems counter-intuitive and wonder why people are n't  supporting the decision . Its because they do n't  understand it . <p> To help get past the decision , its best to lay out next steps and next challenges , This will help everyone shift their focus to the new challenge . <h> Summary <p> While this process of social leadership communications may seem to be more effort and slower , I have found in my experience most times I end up not only with a better decision , but an aligned team ready to support the effort . <p> The other- caveat that I need to share with this approach is , its not instant . It will take people a while to get what you are doing and align with the approach as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution . This is not a project , but a process and it must be repeated time after time in a consistent way . It is through this consistent leadership that your business goals will be achieved . <p> I 'm always curious to hear what people think . Please let me know what you do to lead . Also , let me know if I got something wrong . 
@@12024904 @624904/ <p> This post was written by Maria Ogneva , the Head of Community at Yammer <p> While I was at SXSW last week , I was lucky to have met many Yammer users face to face . Some had just set up their accounts , some had set them up years ago , some were internal Yammer experts and champions for their organizations , and some were newbies . Regardless of level of experience , involvement or facility with Yammer , just about everyone I met , asked " How do I ensure continued engagement in this network ? How do I get people to come back and participate ? " <p> I think this is a key question to ask yourself , and if you can formulate a plan of action prior to rolling out the community , you will certainly be setting yourself up for success . Just like with every endeavor , you need to have solid objectives ( why am I doing this ? ) , plan of action ( what steps will I take to get there ? ) , qualitative and quantitative success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and a plan for evaluation and course-correction , if necessary . <p> At Yammer , we are investing a lot of resources in sharing best practices grounded in real and observable examples . These examples come from our customers stories and our own experiences with our own Yammer network and our customer communities . To help our customers formulate these best practices , we have launched an entire Customer Success Manager ( CSM ) initiative. - We will be bringing you a lot of what we find via this blog and other channels . For now , here are some high-level recommendations that I have observed thus far , and calibrated with our CSMs . <p> Invite the right early users : The strength of any network is determined by the strength of people participating in it . If you are trying to nurture a community , whether its internal or external , take the time to invite the right people and share the vision with them . Make sure that your early users have bought into your vision and can become community champions internally and externally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy and process early on . Be clear on what you want out of the experience , who should be participating and what business problems you are solving . A solid usage policy is also key in helping set the tone for the types of posts that are appropriate and drive your goals forward . <p> Educate : Even with something as easy to use as Yammer , education is still a key component . Your training process should address the " why " and " what 's in it for me " , as much as it addresses the " how " . Make sure everyone has bought into the vision , address any questions and " what-ifs " . <p> Tune into WIIFM : Everyones favorite radio station is WIIFM , otherwise known as " what 's in it for me ? " Make sure your policy and best practices address help your internal constituencies do their jobs , and make them into rockstars . Here are just some examples : <p> Support / helpdesk is able to engage the " collective brain " to quickly get questions to tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and get through more tickets . The customer wins , the company wins , and the support rep is a rockstar . <p> Sales can collaborate with others in the company to gain more insights into a particular deal they are closing . If you are talking to Company A , its very likely that someone else at your company may know someone else at Company A. You can drive your external networking through networking internally . <p> Marketing can learn major customer developments and work with sales to create customer success stories and continue a dialogue with customers across their preferred channels . Marketing can share and collaborate with social media , corporate communications , sales and product team to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time . <p> Social media and community manager keeps a hand on the internal pulse , is able to communicate relevant information to the community and deliver the needed content to the community . Community manager is then also able to communicate what the customer wants back to the company <p> Focus on culture and leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation is paramount to the success of any internal community , and I agree . By getting involved , the leadership team signals that this effort is supported , and the necessary steps to support the process will be taken . It also helps flatten the organization and promote the culture of sharing and transparency that 's necessary for an effort like this to be successful . <p> Have a community leader : Communities are like gardens ; when you water and invest in them , they flourish . Every garden must have a gardener , and every community must have a community leader . This person is there not to simply moderate and ensure adherence to usage policy , but also to help develop community-specific best practices . To promote engagement , the community leader may want to start conversations to inspire people to share what they are experiencing . A good community manager will know key members unique experiences , and will connect the right people in a thread by publicly @ them or sending private messages . <p> Collect and share success stories : Theres tremendous power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for me ? " question and allow to envision success . Success stories also turn the featured users into fans for life who does n't  like sharing their thought leadership ? <p> Integrate business processes : Every company has its own way of doing things . You need to define what online networking and collaboration means to you , and which existing processes it plugs into . For example , GA Communications is looking to Yammer as a replacement for the " team update " meeting , and Deloitte Australia used Yammer successfully to crowdsource an ad tagline . Think through what works for you . Can you integrate Yammer as part of the onboarding process ? Can you recognize performance achievements publicly on Yammer ? Can you make Yammer part of a customer support process , allowing support reps to resolve issues faster ? - Or maybe you can make it part of your crisis communications plan ? Whatever your particular scenario is , think through the steps necessary , and the people you need to call on to make it successful . <p> Create relevant content : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content is shared , and community interactions can help people do their jobs , they will see value and join in . However , you need to have realistic expectations and realize that it will take time to build up a robust information exchange . That being said , you have to be proactive and deliberate in creating it . If people are sharing interesting tidbits over email , why not advise them to have this conversation in public , so others can benefit from it ? Similarly , if a question is raised that can be answered via knowledge that lives in Yammer , why not point to the thread URL from the email ? <p> This list is of course nowhere near exhaustive . Rather , these are just some high-level best practices . Most of these points are universally applicable to building any solid community , whether it consists of colleagues , industry peers or customers . However , items 4 and 7 are more specific to the enterprise space . We will be bringing you a lot of content throughout the upcoming months , diving into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your community ? What are some roadblocks ? If you are a business user , how are you dealing with issues of culture and business process engineering ?

To send a private message to another user start your message with to:username . The advantage of private 1 to 1 Yammer messages , over IM , is that your messages are archived and searchable forever by you and the recipient . <p> 9 . Use @username to address a particular person . Address specific colleagues if the update pertains to them or if they should respond . You can also reply to another update , with @username , to accomplish the same thing . <p> Be sure to invite or add the people in your department to the Group as well . <p> 11 . Post your message to the most relevant Group and use Tags , if applicable . This ensures proper message delivery to members who deem themselves as experts or interested in the subject matter . <p> 12 . If you forget to add a tag to a message , simply reply to the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 13 . Do n't worry about people receiving messages that they may not be interested in . Yammer is structured so the recipient can choose what content they receive based on what or who they follow . Just make sure you post to the most relevant Group and use the appropriate Tags . <p> 14 . Tell other people what you 're working every time you switch projects or when you or your team delivers something significant . <p> 15 . Prefer messages with business value rather than personal status update ( try to avoid messages such as " I just had a good lunch " and such ) <p> 16 . Before asking your colleagues a question , Search Yammer using the search bar in the upper right . It may have already been answered . ( reduce redundancy ) <p> 17 . Turn threaded view On , in bottom left corner of feed , if discussion threads are hard to follow or you 're trying to catch up after a lot of activity . <p> 19 . Check the #joined tag feed to see who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make yourself available to answer questions . <p> 20 . Encourage conversation by taking a controversial stance on something that matters to you and your colleagues . It will get people engaged . <p> 21 . Ask the question : " What value do you get from Yammer ? " and post an example . It will help everyone understand . <p> 22 . Develop an internal Yammer resource group within the organization . ( i.e. people like you ) can assist new users with questions and also help publicize and demonstrate new features . Ideally , these individuals should be familiar with the Yammer Blog , Forum , and follow @yammerteam on Twitter . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

Two years ago , we launched Yammer at the TechCrunch50 conference . Today at TechCrunch Disrupt , we unveiled the new Yammer , including a revamped user interface , a more robust platform , and a number of useful applications . We 've expanded our product from an enterprise microblogging solution to a full-fledged enterprise social network . <p> Since our inception , Yammer has had a public API , allowing third parties to develop applications on top of Yammer . We 've now expanded to a full platform , on which third party companies can develop new applications and integrate existing enterprise apps . Weve built several of our own applications that are available today : <p> Polls Tap the wisdom of crowds by quickly and easily creating a poll and asking co-workers to identify the best option <p> Events Invite co-workers to company or group events and track responses . Download event into Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a form that displays web content such as videos and images inline <p> Soon well add other applications to the list including Ideas and Tasks . In addition to our own applications , were partnering with the following companies who are building applications that integrate with Yammer . <p> Zendesk for Customer Support Attach a Zendesk ticket to a Yammer message so that all customer service agents can collaborate and resolve issues quickly <p> Crocodoc for Document Mark Up and Review Collaboratively highlight and comment on PDFs , Word documents , images and other files that are attached to Yammer messages <p> Lithium for Social Customer Relationship Management ( SCRM ) Enables employees to share and discuss feedback from brand influencers and customer conversations that take place in Lithium 's leading customer community solutions <p> Incorporating these applications into the Yammer feed allows workers to streamline their business processes and quickly have a conversation with their coworkers about the projects they 're working on , whether its a Zendesk support ticket , a PowerPoint presentation stored on Box.net , or a customer dialog in a Lithium community . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst colleagues . <p> In addition to the platform and new applications , we 've also expanded our direct messaging capability , so you can send private messages to multiple participants , adding new people to the thread at any point . We added presence to Yammer , so you can view who is online now . You 'll also notice that tags have evolved to become Topics , giving you an easy way to organize the messages in your feed . In addition to these features , we have enhanced our analytics . Network admins now have access to more , interactive charts , so they can track engagement . <p> We know that many people access Yammer from their mobile devices and the desktop application . Were in the process of updating all of our clients to reflect the new features .

@@12024918 @624918/ <h> This Is Not Your Parents Software Training <p> By the Yammer team , on January 20 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Many of our customers ask us : " What type of training should I do for Yammer ? " I think that 's a very important question to ask , because the evolution of work software necessitates an evolution of training programs behind it . On the one hand , software like Yammer is easy-to-use and really intuitive , but on the other hand , education and training are still important because your success is determined by how you use it . Just because something does n't  need a manual on- how to use it , does n't  mean that everyone knows what to do with it . <p> In the end , technology is only part of the equation ; the bigger and more- complex- part of the equation are the people and how they use the technology . Things get even more nuanced in the business setting , because the success of a network like Yammer is based on its ability to meet organization-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your training strategy is going to be highly contextualized to your business , but here are some big-picture things to keep in mind : <p> Less classroom , more hands-on : Social software is highly experiential and thus does n't  lend itself to long classroom sessions of yesteryear , where the presenter takes all day to explain a complicated product feature by bloated feature . Rather , its something that has to be experienced . Because social software is highly dynamic , facility with such software becomes greater the more feedback you get from using it . You should still do classroom training occasionally , but focus them on a dialogue rather than static one-way communication. - Its also important to note that social media has taught us to learn in different ways : the velocity of obsolescence means that we have to learn and master something in a shorter time than a conventional " class " could ever accommodate . <p> Focus on benefits , use cases and relevance : Remember , everyone is tuned into their favorite radio station WIIFM : " what 's in it for me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - they need something that helps them get their job done faster , better and with greater pleasure ( that 's right aesthetics and usability matter at work ) . More than teaching people how to click around in the tool although you will have to do some of that with " digital dinosaurs " your focus should be on demonstrating value and relevance and helping understand how the tool fits into their workflow . If you can help people tie their own success to it ( more visibility , better career , more money ) , you are golden ! <p> Focus on the " why " and not the " what " : A good way to illustrate relevance is to focus on the " why " of something vs. the " what " . For example , if you want employees to fill out their profiles , you cant make it a task and expect compliance . Rather , focus on why having a profile is important and how its going to help your users get found by someone looking for their expertise . <p> No death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conventional class , keep it more of a dynamic discussion vs. a one-way rehearsed speech . Sometimes , you will need to present some theory , and when you do , I implore you to not kill your audience by powerpoint . Powerpoint is an aide that brings to life your words and helps guide your presentation flow . As a rule of thumb , use minimal words and pictures that elicit an emotional response you want to connect your words to emotions . If you have paragraphs and excessive bullets in your presentation , you are doing it wrong . <p> Focus on best practices : Consistent with your overall goals for the platform , you should help define best practices how you want people to behave . Your community is going to evolve its best practices over time , but you should take the initial step . While you should cover tips for success in a training session , the real bulk of the job is to nurture your users as they dive into the product . Having a core group of " ambassadors " ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paramount in setting a productive tone , as later members will mimic their behaviors . <p> Demystify what , when , where : To write this post , I consulted with my esteemed colleague Allison Michels , our internal guru on training . " You need to help your users create a what / when / where decision chart , " she advised . Oftentimes people do n't  know what message should be posted to what medium and they end up getting nervous and not posting , or wreaking havoc on the natural " flow " - of the community . Make sure you help people demystify the complexity of modern communication what goes on email vs. what belongs on Yammer . <p> Millennials- do need training . Millenials , as good as they are at social technology , still do need training . The training they will need is different from what late adopters need . They do n't  need to be sold on importance of conversation or possibilities of viral content and serendipitous discovery . What they do need is to understand is how Yammer is different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques , such as using groups to get work done . <p> Provide a private space : Another pearl of wisdom from Allison is that you need to provide a private space for new users to post messages . This will help alleviate anxiety and give them a safe place to " practice " before posting to a network with 10,000 people . This way , they can become an expert in private , where you can coach them . <p> No drive-by training : As we established , learning by doing is really key . This does n't  mean that you give your users one training session and throw them into the wild to fend for themselves . Keep your virtual door open and establish a space ( Yammer groups are great for it ) where you can be available to answer questions . Mobilize your ambassadors to also help new users , and foster a mentorship ( perhaps a reverse-mentorship ) culture . Create a resources catalogue , where you can post a selection " Get started " resources and FAQs . <p> Remember , your training is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . Its an ongoing dialogue , which aims to enrich the novice , the advanced , and the expert all at the same time . You as the trainer , will learn quite a bit in the process yourself . Guide people , but give them the freedom to discover the possibilities . In the words of Allison , " your job is not to turn on the lightbulb , its to facilitate others turning on their own lightbulbs . " <p> Good luck and happy teachings !

@@12024919 @624919/ <p> At Extend Solutions , we have watched Enterprise Social and the idea of socializing existing intranets transform the way that companies operate . Facilitating a solid platform , either a standalone Yammer network or an integrated intranet , enables companies to accelerate and consolidate their efforts of driving employee inclusion and engagement . This is even more pronounced in companies where distance , time zone , geographical dispersion or role separation normally represent serious challenges to collaboration , feedback and empowerment for teams . <p> To help companies overcome these challenges , we focus on having a holistic knowledge of organizational change management methodologies and philosophies . Understanding how companies need to change enables them to make the shift toward being more agile and responsive . Every company is different , so we spend time listening to the customers and their needs in order to propose effective solutions and help them make the shift to social . <p> One of our best experiences was helping an organization dedicated to operating restaurants launch their Yammer network . We ran a launch event with more than 200 employees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different locations . We used Yammer to plan , organize and run the event and even gave prizes for involvement .

This was achieved by continuing the use cases we helped them develop . As a result , the company has introduced more than 10 new processes in areas such as operations and marketing to help them use Enterprise Social to run their organization more effectively . The formal launch event helped shift peoples mindset as enterprise social was aligned with the overall organizational objectives and guidelines .

You need to work alongside them to help them create a strategy for transformation . <p> When asked to give advice to traditional Microsoft partners who want to make the step into Enterprise Social , the first thing we say is change your mindset . You need to embrace and adopt the paradigms that are the foundation of Yammer and Enterprise Social , like working out loud and reducing hierarchy . Then you need to understand the platform , and the best way to do this is to use it . Without changing the way you approach your work or using Enterprise Social yourself , it will be extremely difficult to be successful . @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024920 @624920/ <p> After a one-month beta test with a small group of PR 20/20 employees , we rolled out Yammer as our internal social network in December 2010 . As our staff grew , we needed a solution to encourage collaboration , continuously transfer knowledge , and perpetuate our culture . Yammer provides all of that and more . <p> Our team has come to rely on the network as an outlet for information and resources related to the agency and our clients , and it gives us the ability to respond to the real-time demands and opportunities we face on a daily basis . <p> Based on our experience , here are five key benefits of Yammer for professional service firms in general , and marketing agencies in particular : - <p> 1 ) Streamline Communications . <p> As an agency , we suffered from inbox overload .

With Yammer , employees much more readily share information , seek resources from each other , and ask questions. - - <p> 3 ) Keep the Mobile Workforce Connected . <p> As PR 20/20 grows , its become more common for people to work from remote locations . For instance , one employee regularly works from Denver ( were in Cleveland ) and another from her home . Yammer keeps these individuals informed of what is happening in the office , and vice versa . There 's no longer a need for check-in calls or emails . <p> 4 ) Enhance Culture. - <p> While Yammer is primarily used to share work-related information , its also become a way for employees to offer glimpses into their personal lives and get to know each other better . Within our portal , you 'll find wedding and baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sports polls and more . <p> 5 ) Nurture Career Growth and Development . <p> We regularly post educational resources to our Yammer portal , such as relevant news articles and upcoming events . We also use Yammer to facilitate professional development exercises . Here , well post prompts or hypothetical situations , and then ask employees to share how they would respond . These exercises are a great way to get the group thinking critically , and see their peers approaches in real-time . <p> The Launch of an External Learning Network <p> Seeing how well Yammer worked at spreading ideas , sparking innovation and generating collective wisdom within the agency , we decided to take its benefits to our external Marketing Agency Insider community through a learning network . here 's how : <p> Attendees are encouraged to share related resources , ask questions , stimulate discussions and post key takeaways within the network , as a means to improve webinar engagement .

@@12024927 @624927/ <h> Is Your Training Social ? <p> By the Yammer team , on February 6 , 2012May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> You may be interested in using Yammer as a training tool for your organization , but perhaps you are unsure of where to start . Where should you post training content ? What types of content should you post ? Should you- use a training group in your Yammer network or should you have multiple training groups ? Or is there another way ? When we started developing our training program internally at Yammer , we had the same questions as you . <p> Recently , Yammers Learning &amp; Development team presented and exhibited at ASTD TechKnowlege , a national conference for learning and development professionals , where we showcased our internal training university , " YammerVersity " . At the event , many L&amp;D professionals expressed interest in hosting their training university on Yammer , thus this blog post was born . <p> There are a few things to consider when creating your own training environment on Yammer. - First , you need to decide whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network specifically for the training university . As there are benefits and drawbacks to both options , well take a closer look at each . <p> Training Group : A training room everyone is invited <p> By creating a training group ( public or private ) in your main Yammer network , you are simplifying the process but sacrificing robustness . <p> Pros By conducting training in your main Yammer network where the students already exist , you simplify sign-up and join-in process . That still begs the question whether to create a public or private training group ? By building a publictraining group , you remove the separation between the training department and everyone else . Within Yammer , anyone can see the content being posted , thus creating visibility for the team and the programs being created . On the other hand , a private training group creates some privacy for users while still keeping them within your main network . <p> Cons If you are doing a lightweight training program , building a group may work well . However , if your goal is to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality . If you have multiple courses running concurrently , a group may become overwhelming and confusing for students . Creating exercises that point back to the group for example , posting answers to questions and looking for specific content may become difficult as more people join the group and post in it . Furthermore , because this is the real network some user may fear posting . Just like in a classroom , you need to gauge the comfort level of your students and provide a private space for them if they need it . <p> Training Community : A set of training rooms for maximum flexibility and custom privacy levers . <p> A second option is to build an external network specifically for training , with multiple groups . <p> Pros When you build your training network , you do so with the goal of building a safe place where students do n't  fear making mistakes . - By creating an external network focused solely on training , you provide a safe environment for users to ask questions , connect with trainers and complete their training without distractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each training class or track . This makes it easy for students to post questions and find content based on how far along they are in their training . <p> Cons If you do not invite the entire company to the network , your teams visibility may be impacted . Some employees may not see the content in your external network . <p> YammerVersity : A case study <p> As- you can see , there are pros and cons for creating a training university internally and externally . At Yammer , we chose to create an external network specifically for training . The internal Yammer network is flooded with around 17 thousand messages a week , which is very challenging for a new hire to navigate . With YammerVersity , we have created a private and secure environment for new hires to begin navigating Yammer , learning the company culture and completing their training . We are able to invite new hires into this separate external network , YammerVersity , prior to their start date so that they could start to casually internalize Yammer culture <p> When building YammerVersity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training areas . Most groups are pretty straight-forward : " product knowledge " or " CSM Certification " while others are a bit more creative like our onboarding bootcamp we 've named " YamCamp . " Next we seeded appropriate content into each group . Yammer allows you to upload files and add links allowing us to use training content we had already created . We were able to add the appropriate training materials to the corresponding group . That way , users have all the material they need to complete the training , right on Yammer . <p> A question that was asked many times at the ASTD TK12 event was whether we used a special version of Yammer to create YammerVersity . The answer is no . You can set your training university on Yammer today , either as a group within your existing network or as an external network . Yammer makes it easy to switch between your internal Yammer network and your external training university , and you can see notifications no matter what network you are on . <p> When setting up your training university you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an interactive portal for the content you already have , then build from there . Once we finished filling YammerVersity with our pre-existing content , we moved on to thinking of new ways to present new content to our employees . The first thing that popped into mind was to create a space for our internal Subject Matter Experts to share information with the company so we create the SME-gasbord group ! This group acts as our internal Youtube channel where we take quick videos ( no more than 10 minutes long ) of our SME outlining and explaining a topic . These videos then get posted to the SME-gasbord group , where that SME monitors the conversation for any questions that arise . Our employees can then quickly view the content and ask questions directly to the SME , which allows for complete understanding of the content . See here for an example : <p> You can also create fun groups within your training university ! At Yammer , we created a book club . If your work force is geographically dispersed , this is a great way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book the group is going to read . Post questions in the group about the book and use yammer #topics to track each book . There are a lot of great ways to use Yammer to elevate programs you are currently running , like book clubs , and easily create new programs your students will be excited to join ! <p> Now that you 've seen how Yammer created our training university with an external network , we would love to hear your thoughts ! Do you see this as a reality for your organization ? What would you add to your training university ?

We were thrilled to meet so many amazing people at the sessions that we attended , and could n't believe how many customers stopped by our Expo booth to say hi ! We left the conference energized by what we learned and by the many examples of how Learning &amp; Development professionals are using Yammer in their organizations . <p> Informal Knowledge Transfer In many organizations , L&amp;D teams are using Yammer to foster informal exchanges of knowledge . Having conversations on Yammer means that everyday conversations are turned into searchable content . Employees can search this archive of internal company knowledge to help them get their work done better and in a way that is more connected to the broader organization . <p> Formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L&amp;D professionals are revising their training activities , taking training conversations outside of the classroom and eLearning module , and having them instead in a Yammer group . The conversations and activities from training are preserved in Yammer , not relegated to a post-it note , training packet or flip-chart paper . <p> Change Management L&amp;D professionals are also looking to Yammer as the right tool to foster change of any kind . Change management continued to be a very popular topic at the conference . The Harvard Business Review reported that around 70% of change initiatives fail . It makes sense then that 83% of CEOs say that substantial change is their biggest challenge so much so that 28% of CEOs are fired because they mismanaged change . <p> Leadership Onboarding and Development In a session led by Limor Benderly from- Amdocs , a global provider of BSS , OSS , network control and digital services solutions , we learned about some of the challenges organizations face when onboarding senior leaders .

New leaders are expected to perform immediately because of the significant amount of resources invested in the recruiting process . Understanding the org structure , peers , teams , and strategic initiatives used to be easier when new leaders were all located at one headquarters . But that is no longer the reality for most leaders they are spread out across the world . <p> Though Amdocs is n't using Yammer to help onboard their senior leaders , I could n't help but think that a Yammer network could augment their existing onboarding program . <p> Get to know who 's who ?

@@12024935 @624935/ <h> Yammer Customer Network : A Use Case For Yammer Communities <p> By the Yammer team , on July 7 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> In Greg Lowes last post Creating a Yammer Community , he described the basic configuration to set up a Yammer community within your Yammer network . This basic functionality can get you collaborating with key groups outside your company quickly . What happens when you have more complex requirements ? <p> Without examples , this would n't be a very interesting post , and since we " drink our own champagne " here at Yammer , I 'm going to use our own Yammer customer community as an example. - The Yammer Customer Network ( YCN ) is an example of a robust Yammer community for all Yammer customers . With almost 1,500 very active members ( and growing daily ) , there 's a lot of content that 's being created . Although its absolutely key to the health of your community to allow for flow and serendipity , growth necessitates a set of best practices and structural decisions to be made . With Yammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Content Monitoring that can catapult your community to the next level. - Here are some elements that make our network successful : <p> Ease of access <p> For each community member , the Yammer YCN appears as another network on the homepage . You can track your total unread message count ( in red ) ; and when you click the drop- down , you can see which networks you have access to and an unread messages count in each network . <p> Usage policy and best practices <p> Prior to joining the YCN , all members have to- accept the Usage Policy ( premium feature ) . This agreement is written in plain English and indicates among other things that our customer network is a " no sales zone " . It also clearly establishes- repercussions- for republishing confidential information publicly and being maliciously hurtful towards other members . <p> In addition to the above " non-negotiables " from the usage policy , we 've set forth a set of best practices that make this community a better place . In this article , - I 've discussed the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " donts " and governance as a set of enablers , answering the question of what to do vs. what not to do . In the end with proper guidance and education , each community- will eventually self-organize around a set of guiding principles . <p> Ideally , your community should strike a balance between proactive knowledge and best practices sharing ( informing ) asking questions ( provoking thought ) and answering questions ( sharing experiences ) . In addition to clearly stating the mission and the usage policy , make sure you take the time to educate and maintain dialog about the health of your community . <p> Clear role definition and active community management <p> Active community management is imperative because it establishes accountability. - As the YCN grew , so did the need for multiple people to manage the community . This is where being able to assign multiple administrators to a community comes in handy ( premium feature ) . We still recommend that you limit this capability to as few people as possible , but having at least one backup ensures that your process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gets sick or ( gasp ! ) goes on vacation. - As more people start to participate in your community , you will want to establish roles for various members ; their admin access is going to be driven by these roles . <p> Noise management <p> In the beginning , we had very few groups . Activity in the main feed was lower , and most people followed all of the messages . Now that we are managing the community actively , we are seeing a large uptick in activity and are finding it helpful to use Groups ( premium feature ) to focus specific conversations around things such as Product Feedback , Yammer 101 , QA , Product Releases , Analytics , etc . We established these key groups , as well as encouraged members to create new groups to fit their needs . here 's the rule of thumb in the YCN : when the whole community can benefit , post to the main feed ; if your conversation is specific in nature , make sure that you are posting to a group. - When commenting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind others level of noise . <p> Private and public spaces <p> Each paying company gets a private group on Yammer for communicating directly with the Customer Success Team . This enables teams to share information quickly and help others see the history of activities as new people join the customer team . You may also opt to create private Groups for the purpose of collaborating with specific people around specific topics in a private setting . Keep in mind that once you determine privacy settings in Yammer , you cant change them later . <p> Engagement events <p> Make sure you start by seeding the community with the " right " members members who are passionate about reaching the communitys overall goal and are likely to start and participate in discussions that others will find useful later . After you have grown your community to a suitable level of engagement , continue to invite everyone you planned to invite . <p> Sometimes , a community event is a great way to " inaugurate " the community . We recently merged several communities into one and relaunched it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as get all the members to meet each other , we held an event purely in Yammer . In a townhall format , Yammer CEO David Sacks answered questions in real-time . A more detailed account of the steps we took and the results it produced is forthcoming . One of our customers , Austen Hunter , wrote this great post detailing best practices of running such an event . An event that has a broad-based appeal to your community could mark a great start for your community . Make sure your engagement activities do n't  stop there ! - For more tips on effective community management , check out my post for CMSWire.

These certifications allow users to learn advanced Yammer skills , how to promote best practices , and what it takes to be a user on a successful enterprise social network . <p> Recently , the Yammer Certified Professional Program rolled out their first batch of Certified Power Users . The participants in the first group of Power Users represented many different regions such as the United Kingdom , Latin America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and successful course , I decided to ask two of the participants to share their thoughts on the Yammer Certified Power User Program . Here is what they had to say <p> Louise Littig : Thank you for your participation . Can you please introduce yourself , tell me what company you work for , and describe your role ? <p> Birgit Schmidt : I work for LexisNexis , a legal and tax information provider , and part of my role as the intranet manager is to act as a social media evangelist . <p> BS : About 4 years ago we initiated a social networking site and from the response could see that there was potential for this type of engagement , it was obvious that people wanted to share their knowledge with colleagues but it also reached beyond the work remit , we even had a rock fans group ! We identified this as a valuable tool for sharing and networking but unfortunately we did n't  have the management buy-in at the time ! I 'd been looking into micro-blogging and came across several press mentions of Yammer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the network for LexisNexis . It seemed to me to be exactly what I 'd been looking for , a way to provide that 2-way communication channel and added links to it ( and every other social networking site ) to our homepage . In the meantime wed had a change of MD and HR director and when I introduced them to it , they recognized how Yammer would help them fulfill their commitment to improving communication in the business . <p> JM : One of the main tasks I was assigned when I first joined Hablemos Claro was to improve production processes . After analyzing the situation , I concluded that there were issues such as communication problems between teams and no unified mechanism to communicate . This is how I began my quest to find a way for us to use a standard way of communication between the teams . After searching and testing several options , I found Yammer . <p> LL : Why were you initially interested in Yammers Certification Program ? <p> BS : - I was initially interested in the Certification Program out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted Yammer to be a success and had started providing tips and support . Having undertaken Power User Certification , I have a much more comprehensive understanding of all the features and besides that , the interactive sessions during the program made you practice the teaching points ! <p> JM : I became interested in Yammer Certification Programs because I wanted to get more out of the network , strengthen my knowledge , and thus be able to teach my colleagues how the network works and the advantage of working online . <p> LL : What was the most valuable thing you took from the certification program ? <p> JM : What I value most having completed the certification is learning to use the network to the maximum of its possibilities . In particular , I am very comfortable with the empowerment it gives me to know that I can communicate in a fast , modern , and practical way . With this new knowledge , I am a leader and I can guide my colleagues . <p> LL : Have you implemented any of the knowledge you gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . For example , during the Power User program I successfully implemented Hablemos Claros Yammer 101 Group- a group for my colleagues who are not yet familiar with Yammer . In this group my colleagues can learn simple tips and access Yammer-related documents to encourage people to participate more actively . <p> BS : Since doing the program , I 've recommended that we include an " Introduction to Yammer " for all new starters as part of the company induction . I do n't  think I would have felt in a position to offer that before the certification and I 'll be designing the session with the help of all the excellent materials on Yammer ! <p> JM : Since I have become a Certified Power User I have felt much more comfortable and confident in what I do . I also know how to teach the rest of my colleagues and give them the support that they need . After completing the program I work faster , I have strengthened my prior knowledge , and it has shown me how to use the network more efficiently than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone looking for improve their performance and knowledge on how to become more productive and efficient in the way they use their own network . Each group in each Yammer network should have a Certified Power User . <p> BS : Yammer is incredibly intuitive to use but I 'd definitely recommend the program to anyone whose role it is to promote the use of Yammer or to provide support . <p> About Birgit Schmidt : Birgit lives in the United Kingdom and works for LexisNexis , a legal and tax information provider .

@@12024945 @624945/ <h> Are You Connected or Connecting ? <p> Its becoming increasingly important to get connected and stay connected with colleagues , clients and partners . At New Signature , we use Office 365 to increase productivity , maintain culture and bridge geographical gaps in order to truly " work like a network " . The social tools that come with Office 365 are unparalleled in the market today and streamline our processes and communication . Were able to quickly respond to email via mobile applications , collaborate on documents using SharePoint and Yammer conversations and have video chats in real time with Lync . <p> As Office 365 has grown to include more social technologies , we 've embarked on a journey to work socially . Along the way , we 've had great success in connecting with our colleagues around the globe through Office365 , here are a few of the more memorable social stories : <p> Our CEO , Christopher Hertz , requested feedback from remote staff about improving connections to the D.C. headquarters . Traditionally , audio and video of remote staff is streamed on computers in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard , the idea of having a camera on them 40 hours a week made several new staff members uncomfortable . To prevent staff from feeling disconnected or uncomfortable , a Yammer conversation was started to discuss how to use the technology available to ensure remote staff were included in the New Signature community . Numerous remote and D.C.-based staff engaged in this dialog and determined that it should be up to the individual staff member to decide their comfort level . Teams began to use Lync chats throughout the day to connect with staff they work with and video still streams in the office , but its a choice rather than a policy . Staff members are able to decide what works best for their workflow and connect with their team via email , Lync IM , audio , video or Yammer messages . We 've also now implemented a CEO roundtable where we can post questions in Yammer or log in to Lync meetings to discuss concerns , address changes or just ask questions . <p> One of our colleagues posted a request on Yammer for donations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraiser . At previous companies , he would mention it in passing or send a mass email out and receive a small amount of donations . By placing it in Yammer , it became an actionable item for New Signature to address and sparked a sort of competition to push her over her fundraising goal . As someone would donate , they would also write a post about how close she was to her goal . This snowballed into a large portion of the company donating . Within 24 hours , his daughter had to increase her fundraising goal not once , but twice ! She also won some pretty awesome duck trophies . <p> At New Signature we have removed the barriers that typically exist in a formal business setting . Weve broken down walls between management and employees . We 've increased the forum for companywide communication and collaboration . Most importantly , we 've cultivated our internal culture to reflect one of our core values : provide a compelling experience . <p> We 've also learned quite a bit through our journey to work socially . Not everything you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grow from experiences . Whether its a discussion about remote staff video streams , how to improve our weekly all hands staff meeting or learning about colleagues you typically would n't meet , we 've embraced this new idea of working out loud . Its incredibly important to remember that its a journey , not a race . There is no concrete end point for our company or any company that embraces the latest in technology and its ability to connect individuals . @qwx171301 @qwx171306 
@@12024946 @624946/ <h> Connecting IT to the Business through Yammer <p> By the Yammer team , on November 4 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> I work for Mentor Graphics - we make electronic design automation software that enables companies to develop better electronic products faster and more cost-effectively . Our stance is that an enabled workforce is an effective workforce . For this reason , we do n't  pass down many standards when it comes to IT solutions . Whether its Web conferencing software or collaboration platforms , employees are largely free to use the tools they see fit to help them get the job done . The challenge for IT then becomes to manage the tools we do support , while giving a best effort to manage those we do n't  . <p> When an organization has a deep portfolio of " officially supported " and " officially unsupported " IT solutions , it becomes difficult to be all things to all people . We rely heavily on our corporate Intranet to publish and continuously update training documentation , install instructions , video tutorials and other resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need itis an ongoing challenge . Even our extremely knowledgeable , 24x7x365 staffed Global Help Desk is only as successful as the information they know and have access to . While our IT teams and Help Desk work hard to provide excellent support for our supported services , the reality is that our reputation as an IT organization hinges on both the performance of the tools in our service catalog and those tools that employees have installed themselves . <p> Using Yammer to Crowdsource IT Information <p> It should come as no surprise then , that Yammer ( an " officially supported " IT service , by the way ) has become an increasingly successful platform for crowdsourcing IT-related information . More and more , employees are coming to this " virtual information desk " to ask for peer-to-peer advice for installing their remote access certificate , upgrading to Office 2010 , using the instant-meeting feature of our corporate IM client , etc . And while we have always maintained that Yammer is not an official help channel , there has never been a shortage of answers . Good-natured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Intranet , engineers reply with workaroundsit is not uncommon to see ten-plus replies from employees around the globe offering their advice. - Where information was once at best well-documented , and at worst part of a host of undiscovered Web pages , wikis and tribal knowledge , Yammer provides an opportunity to make it all equally discoverable , in real-time , for the benefit of thousands of employees . <p> Integrating Yammer into IT Processes <p> Its safe to say there is a natural fear with enterprise social networking that it will cause more work for IT staff should they get involved . They already have to deal with incoming help tickets , phone calls , shoulder-taps from employees and endless email . The perception is that engaging in two-way conversation on Yammer will be just " one more place " to have to monitor and respond . However , over the course of two years , we 've seen this sentiment change , thanks to a few brave IT souls who have embraced Yammer as part of their communication with employees and between each other . - One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring group where those on watch post hourly updates on critical systems , creating a pass-down log of sorts . Another shining example of the value that Yammer brings to us is our public SharePoint 2010 group , which has become one of the most active Yammer groups , and is used to share information about our ongoing company-wide migration project . This group serves a second purpose of creating visibility for the project through peer-to-peer discussion of SharePoint 2010s new features and capabilities ; something we believe ultimately contributes to greater employee adoption . <p> The next evolution we see for integrating Yammer into IT processes is to make this social information discoverable in other places . We have just deployed the SharePoint 2010 Yammer Web part into our SharePoint environment and are currently testing the Yammer Embed widget on our employee Intranet , which is Drupal-based . Our in-house developers also feed employees most recent Yammer posts into their corporate employee directory profile . Eventually , we hope for Yammer posts to be searchable through our Google search appliance . The ultimate goal being that Yammer is both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a historical record of social knowledge that goes far beyond the news feed to help employees make the most of our IT solutions .

In Yammer years , that was an eon or two ago . At that time , I was based at headquarters in San Francisco and worked primarily with Northeast accounts across Pharma , Media &amp; Advertising , and Professional Sports verticals . I 've always loved New York City , and was eager to help establish the New York office . After all , New York is the fastest growing US tech region and the second largest tech region in the US next to the Bay Area . Mayor Bloomberg is a staunch supporter of the tech growth in the city , and whereas investment banking was once the desired career track , the healthy tech industry has forged its way to the front of the pack . <p> It was decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to New York from Australia , and in true Yammer fashion , it went into effect with velocity . On a subsequent business trip to New York in January , I met with an apartment broker , found an apartment within one day , and on March 1st landed to unlock the door to Yammer New York. - The beauty of being remote within a start-up that 's on a hyper-growth trajectory is that you may be isolated , but you are far from alone . To connect to colleagues was as simple as entering our internal Yammer network . As soon as I set up the Yammer New York public group and started getting likes from my colleagues , Yammers cultural power permeated the space , and Yammer New York was thus born healthy and strong . <p> With more colleagues joining our team within the past four months , we have already moved twice , and are now in our third temporary space . Our temporary office is at Techspace , a shared , turnkey facility with fantastic staff , which has helped make the move seamless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually , i.e. connecting professional people within organizations , driving consistent culture , and thus elevating everyones ability to contribute to that community . <p> Our future Yammer office on W. 18th St. is currently being built out .

" <p> Yammer New York operates on the hub and spoke model with the city hub office connecting our numerous Sales , CSM , Training , and Solution Engineers throughout New Jersey , Connecticut , Pennsylvania , Massachusetts , Virginia , and Florida . Run by our Regional Vice President , Fran Forte , the Yammer New York office functions as the regional hub with San Francisco headquarters as the primary hub . <p> Its exciting being part of New Yorks growing tech community while also being connected to Yammers pervasive culture .

The Yammer New York team is constantly in the air , on a train , or taking to the streets to get from meeting to meeting . Our Yammer mobile apps get a lot of use and keep us connected when were traveling . Transparency is very important within our work and culture , and with our posts to the Yammer New York group , headquarters is able to keep close tabs on our progress . <p> Central Park has quickly become Yammer New Yorks Center for Work Life Balance . The formation of the Yammer New York Running Society with the post-run debrief taking place at The Boathouse has become routine . We use the Endomondo geo-tracking app to log our runs and we then post them to Yammer so that our colleagues see the evidence . here 's one of our recent 4 mile YNYRS runs. - We now even do the YNYRS runs when we travel together and if a visiting Yammer employee runs with us , they automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sense of community that Yammer offers its customers is enjoyed and appreciated by Yammer New Yorks employees .

Virpi hopes that this can inspire others and provide them with an action plan to help change how their organizations work . Virpi works for the London-based- National Council for Voluntary Organisations ( NCVO ) - and draws- visual explanations . <p> A few words from Virpi about her creation : <p> These illustrated tips are my subjective advice on how to introduce Yammer in your organisation . Most of them are based on my personal experience as the sole internal comms person in a non profit organisation . <p> From the story you probably noticed that introducing Yammer to a traditional organisation means a lot of work . Many people seem to think Yammer should take off almost completely organically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  fall in this trap . If you are the only person whose job is to drive adoption in your organisation you should be prepared to wear many hats and work actively behind the scenes . You might end up training staff , lobby senior management , recruiting Yammer champions , acting as Yammer tech support as well as strategising the smartest ways to sneak Yammer into existing processes . <p> But even though you have to scoop quite a lot on your proverbial plate with this Yammer thing I think the benefits are well worth the effort . So if you think you 've hit a brick wall with Yammer I would advise you to persist and concentrate on finding opportunities where Yammer can make a real difference . Go and talk to people to find out what these opportunities are ( hint : listen what people complain about ) . - Go and find the people who can drive change within their teams and departments . Little by little , you might start seeing cracks in the wall a team here , a project group there Over time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficient ways of communicating . And do n't  be disheartened if you fail at first . Yammer is not just a tool , its a culture change , and nothing is harder or more rewarding than changing the culture of an organisation . <p> So celebrate the small victories they are the seeds you are sowing for a bigger change in the future . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

A customer attends a presentation you delivered on- SharePoint- or- Enterprise Social . You kill it . Everyone in attendance walks away knowing they want to implement SharePoint at their organization . Then it happens . You get the call : " Can you come help us install SharePoint ? We could really use the assist . Also , we will almost certainly need your help with some customization and integration work once we are up and running . " Your customer ignores your invitation to talk about use cases . They have so many things they want to do with itthey just need it installed and configured . You hope that this time it will be different , even though deep inside you know it will be the same . You reply , " That sounds great ! I 'll see you Friday ! " <p> You did not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real expertise is in systems integration and solving business problems . However , you recognize that SharePoint enables you to do that more effectively , and you have to have a deployment footprint in order to have something to build upon , right ? So you show up on Friday . You bring your A-game . You are in the trenches with the customers system administrator . In lock-step , you fend off all the typical installation and configuration issues . You have done this so many times now you have it down to a science . Even when you are faced with new configuration issues , you make mincemeat of them . Then you see the coveted link that your top-level site collection has successfully been created , and you click the link to view your home page . Boo-yah ! <p> Now you can show them what you are- really- made of . You say " Tell me your pain points . What problem are we trying to solve ? " You know exactly what response is coming . " First , show me how to use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key stakeholders to get the ball rolling ? Then we will talk specifics . " Again , being a compliant business partner , you reply , " Absolutely ! " You show them the ropes . The line of business stakeholders see how wonderful SharePoint is and how easy it is to use . They even found some YouTube videos to show them how to build their own solutions . Before you can even ask what is next , you get a " Thank you ! Well be in touch once we have had a chance to get our feet wet . " You know it will be some time until they call , if at all . At least you kept food on the table another day , and the installation footprint just grew by one . Eventually , the integration work will trickle in . <p> If you are like me , you were not an early adopter with Office365 . I checked it out . There were things I liked early on , and things I did not like . I had to get used to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do on-premises .

" You see , now I can focus where I have wanted to focus all along on solving business problems . " Why ? " you ask . Because now the tedious configuration mini-projects have faded and the large , up-front deployment costs are spread across months ( even years ) leaving more budget for a trusted advisor to guide the company in adoption and best practices . We recognized the opportunity that was available to us , but taking advantage of it is another thing .

However , I may have greatly underestimated the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can measure the ROI that a solution I built will bring to an organization , but I had never really considered how driving platform adoption could multiply the opportunity for more of those solutions . I needed to become an agent of change . As a Microsoft Gold Partner with a Cloud Productivity Competency , this was a key thing for us to understand . Our team has a renewed focus as a result of this training . <p> A key takeaway for me was " deployment does not equal adoption . " The thing about it is I already knew that . But I have to say that I now view it in a different light . As a result of the training , I have felt more empowered to shift the conversation from technology to outcomes . Again , Microsofts Office 365 ( along with the rest of the cloud stack ) has allowed us to do just that by removing the complexities of installing and configuring the platform . Now we can focus on adoption from the very beginning and make it a focal point throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a focus on adoption will bring an increase in recurring services revenues for partners . <p> We have been a Microsoft Gold Partner for well over a decade . We have seen a lot of campaigns come and go . I do not recall if I have ever been as pleased I have been with the recent efforts of this Office 365 team . We have a great Customer Success Manager who works with a great team of people . They are knowledgeable about their products , experts in adoption strategies and are always willing to help . If you are a partner that is looking to immerse yourself more in your customers business and become a trusted advisor to them , I highly recommend this training . Also , a big thank you to all of the partners who shared their case studies with the product team . I am looking forward to inviting more from my team to attend the training and learning to measure adoption on projects of their own . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

Social media and enterprise social tools are accelerating the rate of exchange of information. - - We could be on the verge of major change . - If you are not paying attention , all this change is going to feel like a revolution . <p> These changes in work will also feel like a revolution when it shows us the limits of some of the current models of management . Leading management thinkers like Gary Hamel are asking questions on what will be the future of management and can organisations adapt . <p> However enterprise social tools reveal this directly. - When we open channels of feedback and see genuine two-way discussions in our organisation , we often learn that we do n't  have the control that we think we have using traditional management techniques like hierarchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with engagement , communication , strategy execution , alignment and other issues arising from a workforce that makes its own decisions. - The little revolts happens all the time but less publicly , passively and without the ease of a network to connect to similar views . As our workforces become more engaged and motivated , it becomes even more important to realise that control must give way to building purpose , context , influence and debate . Realising that some of our current models are n't  as effective as we think creates dramatic changes in our approaches . <p> Adapting to these changes is not going to happen in your organisation without leadership. - We need leaders to drive the process of monitoring the environment , developing new skills and fostering the experimentation in new ways of working. - Most importantly of all leadership will be required to manage and support people through an environment and disruptive change <p> Leveraging Social Networks can help <p> Enterprise social networks can help organisations to follow and leverage these changes in five key ways : <p> Improve monitoring : - the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to look and share changes that they see , the less likely you are to be surprised by the pace of change. - Social media and enterprise social are ideal tools to monitor the environment in and around your organisation. - Know you have effective tools to allow people anywhere across your organisation to see something and share it internally . <p> Network your organisation : do you know what your organisation knows ? - Do your people know how to find information and key contacts ? - The world around is networked. - You had better network your own organisation to improve its effectiveness to connect and share . <p> Accelerate your experiments in new ways of working : - - - Want to explain the rationale or background to an experiment ? Need to find volunteers for an experiment ? - Need to share progress ? - Want to ask for ideas or suggestions on improvement ? - An engaged enterprise social community will be able to assist in accelerating all of these tasks . <p> Empower and enable leaders in every role : - If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pace of change . - Too little information and context will flow to decision makers and it will take too long to respond . All forms of social media can help you better train , inform and empower local leaders at every level to contribute to the changes required. - McKinsey and Company has recently outlined some of the key skills that need to be fostered in this article. - - Skills like storytelling , sense making and designing change in much more social work processes are critical to the environment we now operate in . All of these are on our capability lists for leaders but social just throw each of these into much higher relief . We need to learn new- skillls to be effective as social creeps into our environment and all our relationships. - <p> Build an open , collaborative and innovative culture : - - Culture is the ultimate element of strategy. - Building an open , collaborative and innovative culture will help your organisation adapt to this change. - Using yammer to create a vibrant conversation about sources and drivers of innovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accelerate your adaption . <p> Organisations need to make a decision to change with the rapid &amp; networked evolution of work. - Tools like Twitter , Linkedin , Facebook and most of all Yammer can help your organisation improve its ability to adapt by engaging your whole organisation in finding , sharing and responding to the changes. - Otherwise you might just be left wondering what just happened . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

We occasionally may lose sight of how our work impacts the company or how other employees could influence our work . <p> Looking beyond your own work , and reaching out to others in your company is a vital part aligning yourself to your teammates and organization . <p> How do we go about doing this ? Being transparent about what you 're working on , asking for help , and sharing information is just the beginning . This may seem overwhelming , but the fact is , being transparent in your work is as easy as mentioning a colleague on Yammer . <p> In one small action , you are essentially saying " Heads up , this may be important to you " . Instead of keeping your work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are actively seeking opportunities to share . Let 's take a look at three situations where you could mention someone you work with and facilitate transparency in your work . <p> 1 . Bringing in an expert We all encounter problems at work that we just cant solve alone . Posting this problem or question to Yammer and admitting you need help is nothing to be ashamed of ! Say you need to order supplies for an event , but have no idea what vendors to work with . Instead of searching the internet for prices , save time by at mentioning the events manager at your company . As an expert in the area , they will be able to help out and perhaps even save you money ! People are keen to share knowledge , especially if it means they can help you with your job , save you time or solve a problem . <p> 2 . Expanding the conversation Adding someone into an existing conversation on Yammer helps in two ways . One , it adds a new perspective to the discussion , which opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have insights that participants may not have previously discussed . Two , you are helping that colleague participate in a conversation that they may not have been aware of . Expanding the conversation allows for more employees to share their opinions and participate in a wider variety of topics . <p> 3 . Sharing knowledge or information or updates If you come across an interesting article , note , thread , or file on Yammer that may be useful to a coworker mention them ! Not only are you helping to spread useful information around the organization , you may even be making someones job easier . If a coworker is looking for a editorial calendar , and you know that one exists on Yammer - mention them on the file . Simply mentioning a colleague helps bring awareness to something they may not have previously seen or found . <p> There are many other reasons to mention someone on an interesting discussion or relevant file on Yammer , but the benefits are clear . Sharing information and conversations helps save time , increase collaboration and get work done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something beneficial ? Share your story below !

@@12024962 @624962/ <h> nSynergy 's Guide to Enterprise Social Adoption <p> By the Yammer team , on November 5 , 2014May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> At nSynergy , we have been working with Enterprise Social across multiple platforms for more than five years , with Yammer at the forefront of our strategy since being acquired by Microsoft in 2012 . Around that time , our customers could see that Enterprise Social was here to stay , but many were not sure how to implement a tool still widely being dubbed " Facebook for enterprise " a phrase I prefer to avoid . <p> Over the last few years , acceptance and understanding of Enterprise Social has drastically increased , but many customers are still unsure how to deploy and get the most out of enterprise social . Especially if they have tried on previous occasions and not been particularly successful . They might have experienced good adoption in the early stages but once the honeymoon period was over , usage dropped off and staff reverted back to old practices . <p> I do n't  like to pigeonhole customers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unique business , they tend to have the precisely the same collaboration and communication challenges . Certainly each social project has different cultural challenges and deployment strategies , but generally speaking , by deploying social , they are trying to achieve one or more of the following : <p> Communicating to employees and giving them a voice Connecting people or expertise often due to geographical or departmental boundaries Breaking down information silos and facilitating collaboration Facilitating knowledge transfer that could otherwise be lost <p> While these challenges ( and many more ) can be addressed by Enterprise Social , it does n't  always guarantee success . <p> We believe the approach we take with our customers when deploying Enterprise Social is critical to its ultimate success . Our Yammer Adoption Program ( YAP ) has been developed over many engagements of varying size and is constantly being improved to meet the fast-moving world of social . YAP aims to get businesses adopting Yammer and realising its benefits , whether they are new to the platform or just trying to derive more value from an existing Yammer investment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end with this adoption program . In many ways it is just beginning , as you come to a deeper understanding of what works for your organization ( and what does n't  ) and how your use cases will change over time as your business changes and adapts to the market . We see customers benefiting from social collaboration in many different ways , from driving competition in the organization to providing better and more consistent customer service and on-boarding new employees faster . <p> We favor short , sharp engagements that are essentially broken down into three stages . <p> Stage 1 revolves around preparation and configuration . Its vital to understand your use cases for the initial rollout and tie them back to key strategic initiatives . Its OK if most of your use cases focus on adoption in the early stages , because you will have plenty of time to turn them into engagement and drive business value later . <p> Identifying success criteria for your use cases is key , since this will make your final report and rollout strategy much easier to justify . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged their store staff to take pictures of merchandising displays and share them with other stores and the Regional Manager . A little competition led to much bigger and better displays , which drove up in-store sales and allowed the Regional Manager to be much more informed and connected ! Stage 1 is also the time when you configure Yammer e.g. directory sync , single sign on ( SSO ) , creating groups and performing training . During this stage , its important to work closely with your Communications team , your Information Manager and also HR to make sure your messaging is on point . <p> Stage 2 is a defined pilot period , often between four and eight weeks , where you focus on driving your initial use cases , encourage further adoption through exercises like YamJams , support your newly-appointed community managers and report against your success criteria . It is unlikely that all your use cases will be successful straight off the bat that 's OK , chances are new use cases are being identified by users anyway . <p> During Stage 3 its time to review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollout . What are your lessons and how do you replicate your success across other teams , offices or countries ? You begin to share success stories with those who have been unenthusiastic about Enterprise Social , since evidence and comments from real users is incredibly powerful . By now your community managers should understand their role but that does n't  mean they do n't  need ongoing support . The goal is to get your network to a level where it largely manages itself . <p> Here are my steps to social success : <p> 1 . Treat it like a project . When rolling out a new finance system or desktop you have a project budget , project manager , objectives , timelines and stakeholders . Why should it be any different for deploying enterprise social ? Yammer leverages the viral adoption model , which often means a forward-thinking department will go out and set up a freemium network that grows organically throughout the business . The project really begins when it becomes time to exercise a little more control and upgrade to an enterprise network , use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire business . <p> 2 . Define your use cases . <p> 3 . Have a clear vision for Enterprise Social in your organization . What are your goals for next year and the year after that ? What does success mean to you ? <p> 4 . Executive sponsorship is essential for driving adoption and momentum . If the CEO endorses the platform , or is visible and engaged on the platform , then it becomes an easy choice for others . <p> 5 . Community management stays top of mind . It has been said many times before , but community managers are the life blood of your social strategy . They are contributors , moderators , ambassadors and trainers , and I have not seen many successful enterprise social networks without them ! Good luck with your enterprise social rollout . They can be really interesting , rewarding projects and it is safe to say I have been surprised in each one I have been involved in .

@@12024966 @624966/ <h> Quick &amp; Easy Training in Yammer <p> By the Yammer team , on January 7 , 2014June 28 , 2017 0Shares <p> Providing Yammer training to your users is essential for adoption and engagement . A new tool often attracts initial users who want to explore , but sustainable engagement is only possible once users understand how and why they would use a tool . While hands-on training sessions are the best for getting your users on Yammer , they do not scale well to large organizationsbut self-paced training can . With Yammer , you can create self-paced training using the resources we offer and some creativity . <p> In your Yammer Help Group , you can create some structure by creating a Note and using the Yaminars ( short instructional videos ) to create self-guided learning for your users . When creating the Note , you can use the rich text editing features in the top left of the Note to create headings , bullets and indentations . <p> Use the hyperlink feature in the top right of the Note to link to the specific Yaminars you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files , links or Notes you think would help your users . Under each video , or section , provide a few bullet points to explain the feature and how it is applicable to your organization . From my experience , Yammer training really sticks when you give your participants concrete examples of how they will use the tool to get work done . <p> By giving your users an activity to complete after watching the video , it will help reinforce the knowledge . If there are certain things your organization requires your users to do upon signing up to Yammer , this is a great place to add those instructions . Adding specific tasks into the self-paced training will help you when it comes time to check on who has completed the training . <p> Currently , the ability to see who has viewed a Note or video is not available in Yammer , so when it comes time to track who has completed the training it can be tricky . One idea for tracking the training that has worked well is adding a " training finishers Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Note once theyve completed all the tasks this will give you one easy place to see all your participants . Use the Note linking function on the top right of the Note to link your training and finishers Note together so that participants can easily find where to add their name . <p> Once you 've finished creating your Notes , its time to advertise the training . Follow the topic #joined on Yammer so you can see any time someone new enters the network .

@@12024979 @624979/ <h> Developer Diaries : How Life at Yammer Inspired a New Hit Feature <p> By the Yammer team , on March 19 , 2013May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> As a Product Marketing Manager , I have the opportunity to work with many different Product Managers at once . This means I get exposure to a wide range of new features typically from conception to full release. - This past quarter , one feature in particular caught my attention : New User Badges . There is an interesting story behind this feature , so I sat down with Product Manager Christina Lucey to talk through the development and process behind this feature . <p> Michelle Tandler : So Christina , what is a New User badge ? - Christina Lucey : A New User Badge is an overlay across the bottom of a new users profile picture. - It says " New " to indicate to existing members that the user has recently joined the organizations Yammer network . Once a user has been on Yammer for two weeks , the badge disappears . <p> MT : Where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this feature ? - CL : Actually yes , the feature was inspired by something we do for new hires at Yammer . On a new-hires first day , they get a name tag on a lanyard and are encouraged to wear it around their neck for the first week . This makes new employees easy to spot , so others can strike up a conversation , welcome them , and find out what they 're going to be working on . For the new person too , it makes them more comfortable to do the same , and introduce themselves . We thought if we could replicate this behavior within our customers Yammer networks , new users would have an easier time connecting with their colleagues . <p> MT : So what was the ultimate goal ? Why does it matter if people in a network reach out to someone new ? - CL : The main goal was to help users seeing Yammer for the first time get value right away , by making them feel more comfortable about posting , Liking , and replying to other peoples messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy it is to interact with people across their company . It might sound obvious , but if a new user sees value from Yammer early on , they are more likely to return and contribute to their companys network again and again . <p> MT : Makes a lot of sense . So how hard was it to build ? CL : This feature was actually relatively easy to build compared to many of the other features it took just a couple of weeks with one engineer . The hardest part was figuring out where to add the badges since we display avatars ( profile pictures ) in many places on Yammer . <p> MT : How did you test the feature , and what were the results ? CL : We ran an A/B test for a few weeks on a subset of new users . During the test some new users had the badge and some did n't  , and we compared them . The results were really impactful . The group of users with the badge posted more , used Yammer more , and sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results a surprise for you ? - - CL : Yes the feature was more impactful than we anticipated considering how minimal the change to the product was . The increase in invites was definitely the most surprising outcome . <p> MT : Interesting . Why do you think users sent so many invites ? CL : - Unfortunately , the data only tells us what happened and not why it happened ; - but- that is why we have an awesome user research team . One theory is that users seeing the " New " badges were reminded that not all of their colleagues are on Yammer and that they should invite more . A theory I like better is users in the experiment had a better experience , and wanted to recommend the product to their coworkers . <p> MT : Thats great . So what are some takeaways from this project ? - CL : There are a couple . First , there can be value in capturing the essence of real life behavior and mimicking it in the features we build online . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags ) and translated them to the virtual world ( an overlay on the avatar ) . - Second , the size of the team does n't  necessarily equate to the impact a feature can have on the user experience . This was a very small team working on a pretty small feature , but it resulted in significant improvements for new users . Third , its important to test a feature to see the full scope of results. - In this case , an increase in sending invites was an unexpected , yet pleasant surprise . <p> MT : So what happens next ? Is this feature still testing ? - CL : The results were very positive so we rolled the feature out to all networks . Now all new users on Yammer receive the New User Badge . <p> MT : Great to hear .

Even with the first iPad , business users have been the most significant user group , according to Forbes . Usage and testing started out with about 50% of Fortune100 companies , and now its as high as 80% . Improved size , weight , speed and video conferencing capabilities will make it even more desirable for business travelers . At Yammer , we are building an internal social network that 's powered by humans ; it exists to fuel human communication in the workplace . Since todays workers are increasingly mobile , we are always cognizant of solving their pain points where they are ; since they are using the iPad , that 's where we are going to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPad app that 's powerful and flexible , with the mobile worker in mind . <p> As businesses struggle to always be " on " and employees are always on the go , mobile applications have become ubiquitous in the workplace . Due to the demands of the modern marketplace , we are no longer clocking in and out between 9 and 5 . Globally distributed teams and traveling teams need to collaborate better . Even internal teams who stay " put " undergo significant changes to their internal process in response to the immediacy and transparency of the social web . Thus , a need for mobile collaboration devices is more pronounced today than ever . A recent CMS Wire article states this type of collaboration as one of the top 3 things that must exist on a mobile device : <p> " Mobile devices must Allow people to follow what their colleagues are working on with " Twitter-style " updates , within the secure confines of the corporate communications environment " . <p> I go to conferences all the time , and I 've been able to observe that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done via an iPad . Although inadequate for hard-core content creation , iPad is wonderful for native apps that provide a rich feature set without having to browse mobile web such as checking and responding to emails , tweets , Facebook messages , and perusing publishing apps like Flipboard . This is why we are hard at work creating a native Yammer application for the iPad that will have some of the major functionality that you are used to in the web application and desktop app . <p> The Yammer iPad app will give you a clean left toolbar to access the most common functions , such as : my feed , direct messages , @ mentions , unread message counts , RSS feeds , bookmarks , groups , profiles , company directory , and others . Each message in the feed is fully threaded can be expanded to include all responses within a thread , with the ability to drill down on each team members profile view . The new app will track and display read vs. unread messages . Just like with the current iPhone app , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you are flying to a conference and need to take a quick pulse-check on the major happenings in the organization you are demoing the product , and need to make sure you have the freshest news . The Yammer iPad app can provide you that gut-check while you are still seated in your airplane seat . What if you are traveling to see a client and are stuck answering a difficult question ? What if you have just one hour to find an answer and do n't  even know who in your organization can provide that answer ? Just pop the question in the Yammer app , @ mention some people you think may have the answer , and watch the smart responses pour in. - Maybe you are in charge or your companys website , and someone discovers that its down while you are traveling by a commuter train . They can post a yam , which you can discover immediately and alert the right people to take action before you get to the office . Or maybe you are a social media junkie like me , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yammer for crisis communication in the unfortunate event the site goes down , always having the right answer for your Twitter followers . <p> These use cases are many , and you are only limited by your imagination .

@@12024987 @624987/ <h> 3 Steps to Achieve a Successful Network Migration <p> By the Yammer team , on February 7 , 2014May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> While helping customers succeed with Enterprise Social , one topic that regularly comes up is " migrating " from existing Yammer networks or legacy platforms . We typically see two migration scenarios in organizations : multiple Yammer networks , common in organizations with multiple email domains or subsidiaries , and legacy Enterprise Social tools that were used prior to the adoption of Yammer . <p> To ensure a successful migration to Yammer , its important to focus on what the objectives of Enterprise Social are for your organization , as this in turn determines how you would want your network to be structured . Additionally , having a clear understanding of the end state you want for your networks will help you in understanding your migration requirements . Based on our experience to date , our suggested approach is to take the following three steps : <p> 1 . Choose a network design that is suited to your end business goals <p> Enterprise Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its important to consider how you might want to design your Yammer network . This may include using independent networks one per email domain to suit the way your organization wishes to collaborate . If your objective is broader cross-company collaboration , consider creating one central network , to which all company domains have access . External Networks are handy when a lot of work is being done with third parties and vendors . Whichever design you choose , we always encourage the largest potential network to maximize productive collaboration across your organization . <p> 2 . Start fresh with content <p> Our customers experience has shown that technical migrations of content are not generally recommended , as information on Yammer tends to be more ephemeral in nature not necessarily needed as material for future reference . There is better potential for users to be invested in and engaged with the new network if they are empowered to shape its structure and content themselves . <p> 3 . Migrate organization behaviors to the new design <p> Make sure to understand how people have been using each network that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in groups and topics to understand what the target behavior might look like in the new network . Once the target behavior has been agreed upon , task these stakeholders with establishing that behavior in the new network , including uploading any key materials . Make use of Yammers Enterprise data export function to create a content archive , should this be required in future . <p> We have seen networks that take this approach continue to sustain engagement with minimal end user disruption , enabling users to focus on using Enterprise Social to improve the way they work . <p> For more information on the structural flexibility that Yammer offers , check out how Yammer Network Architecture can be configured to suit your organizations needs .

@@12024988 @624988/ <h> What Makes A Great Internal Community Manager ? <p> By the Yammer team , on September 8 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Social tools are easy and intuitive to use , but they are only as good as people using them. - As the old adage goes : " Garbage in , garbage out . " As you build out your internal social network , your plan should include an internal community manager someone responsible for its overall well-being . Why is that ? Simply because accountability gets results . How many successful initiatives do you have without a clear owner ? <p> What this does n't  mean is that you need to hire a full-time person on day one ; you can certainly work up to it . You can ( and should ) have several people taking care of the community , and even if they are doing this part-time , there will still need to be that one " owner " . Whether or not your community manager is full-time or part-time , the job is not trivial , and you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are that person ? I 've written about attributes and skills necessary for an external social media manager before , and although there 's some overlap , it makes sense to explore in more detail on this blog . <p> An internal community manager is : <p> Passionate : In every piece of writing I do on the subject , I always place this characteristic at the top of the list . You can learn a lot of other skills ; however , passion is something you ca n't fake . Most likely , you will be breaking new ground and changing the companys culture ; it will be challenging . Your passion will keep you going when you want to quit . All great community managers internal or external have passion ( often borderline fanaticism ) in common . They are passionate about their communities and industries , passionate about making a difference , passionate about the higher mission that the community is built for , passionate about connecting and helping people . This brings me to my next point . <p> Inspired by service and people : Any social network - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  want to interact with people or be generally helpful , you probably wo n't make a very good community manager . As a community manager , you will be the resource for the entire community for best practices and continued support and enablement . Treat that as a badge of honor , and always focus your discussion on what you want people to do vs. what not to do . That will minimize your need to make unpleasant decisions ( see below ) . <p> Able to inspire others to act : Related to the point above and inspired by comments from Kate Dobbertin and Christian Dahlstrom below , the community manager , although the person ultimately responsible for the health of the community , must realize that its all about allowing the community be a community . If your community depends on the community manager to be always present , it will fail . If your community can self-sustain , it will succeed . Thus , the job of the community manager is to encourage people to talk to each other , build relationships , work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well-connected : An internal community manager is very well networked in his / her organization . In a fledgling community , you have to galvanize the organization to participate and take a leap of faith with you . To that end , you need to know your colleagues , what their strengths are , and make sure you have shared goals and viewpoints . In a more mature community alike , you have to know your coworkers in order to facilitate the connection of people to each other . <p> Knows evereything and is everywhere : As good as platforms like Yammer are at search of older content and serendipity of real-time discovery , sometimes important discussion points and questions get overlooked and need human involvement . If you see an important question languish without an answer , you as a community manager , need to do some legwork and connect the pieces and people . <p> Understands existing business processes : A key differentiator between an internal and external community management is that an internal manager must understand how the business works from the inside . A successful community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purposes ranging from innovation to planning events . The community manager must know how to flow information and issues raised in the community into the right process . <p> Tactful and diplomatic:Because you are dealing with people and their careers , its paramount to always be tactful and diplomatic . In case you ever have to moderate a situation , things may get awkward later down the road if you mishandle the situation . By the way , fewer situations get out of control in an internal community vs. external . Unlike external communities , peoples careers are on the line , so there 's a heightened interest in " behaving . " <p> Confident and shrewd politician : The internal community manager is oftentimes navigating a previously unexplored space and creating an unprecedented socially-enabled workspace . The community manager will need to be able to sell the value of the effort to the C-suite , managing and mentoring upwards , aligning and navigating objections . The community manager needs to be confident , but never conceited . <p> Can create structure without stifling : The goal of a network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conversation . Thus , its important to not do anything to stifle a natural exchange . At the same time , in active networks , a " free for all " with no structure wont sustain over time , especially as the network grows . Its important to put structures in place that allow users to find what they need easily and help them isolate signal from noise , per their own definition ( one mans noise is another mans signal , in essence ) . This requires cooperation on the part of the writer , reader and responder , and the community manager is there to make sure that best practices are being developed and adhered to . <p> Not afraid to make unpleasant decisions : Each community should have its own policy and governance , and the breadth and depth of the policy is going to depend on your companys legal and HR teams involvement and comfort levels . The community manager will ensure that this policy is written , represents the stakeholders interests and is adhered to . The community manager knows where the line is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and escalate the major ones to the right departments to take disciplinary action . Outside of infractions , the community manager should take action to ensure that the general mood of the community is productive and constructive . <p> Patient like a saint : As your network gains mainstream acceptance in your company , you will be the person to whom everyone comes for advice . Remember what we said about accountability leading to success ? Well , congratulations you are that person ! As new users will come in , you will find yourself answering the same questions over and over . Recognize patterns over time and create your own list of FAQs ; direct people there . At times you will feel like you are stuck in The Groundhog Day movie having the same discussions over and over . That 's OK ; remember , you are a resource for everyone else . <p> Creative like a circus : Success in a community takes diligent development and observing of best practices , as well as a dash of serendipity and creativity . How will you launch your Yammer network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your 100th user ? What about user 10,000 ? Predictable is boring ! Let your imagination run wild and take some chances . As we all experience information overload , you need to stand out . Check out some creative things our customers have done . <p> Industry and market expertise : Your internal community manager needs to be the jack of all trades and really know what 's going on in the market . The knowledge of macro and micro trends and market forces , as well as immaculate knowledge of the company , will allow this person to have interesting and- enlightening- conversations with others . <p> The above success characteristics are common to many internal community managers ; of course the list is not exhaustive . Depending on the lifestage of your community , you may need to emphasize certain characteristics above others , but that 's fodder for a follow-up blogpost . <p> So what do you think , reader ? Do you manage an internal community , or know someone who does ? What success characteristics are you finding important ?

The reason for providing such a vast arsenal is for you to feel comfortable and confident that you can communicate with co-workers anytime , no matter your location or working preferences . Below you will find each of the 7 ways to send and receive Yammer updates , and some qualities of each : <p> The desktop application enables you to view all of the feeds , send new updates , or reply to existing updates . It does n't occupy a browser window or tab and can be sized to save valuable desktop real estate . The light and low profile nature is the main reason it 's the most widely used Yammer application . You can choose from any of the three color schemes displayed below , depending on your preference . The ability to follow people or tags from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . Also note that you must be able to install Adobe AIR to use this application . <p> The Blackberry Application is one of the Yammer mobile applications . Wherever you have adequate phone service you will be able to view all the Yammer feeds , send and receive updates , as well as reply to existing updates . You can also view full conversation threads in a single feed through the blackberry application . <p> The iPhone application is another Yammer mobile application which enables you to do everything the Blackberry application does . In addition , the iPhone application offers a members directory that lists everyone in your Yammer network . From there you can call or email each person with a simple touch . The added ability to follow people directly from the members directory is coming soon . Stay tuned . <p> Receiving and sending messages through IM is available . Much like the desktop application , your IM buddy list takes up very little desktop real estate . You can receive IM messages when a message is posted to Yammer that meets the criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages , all messages you 're following , or only messages addressed to you . You can also specify a time period where you do n't receive updates . To start or stop receiving IM 's is as easy as sending the " On " or " Off " command to the Yammer IM bot . Currently , Yammer supports Gtalk , AIM , and Jabber for IM . <p> If you like the mobile capabilities but do n't have an iPhone or Blackberry you may want to use SMS text messaging . You can determine whether you receive all messages you are following or just messages addressed to you . Posting an update is as easy as sending a text message to 30201 . Because you sync your phone with Yammer prior to using SMS , Yammer automatically knows what network the message should be directed to . Currently , Yammer only supports U.S mobile carriers for SMS , but International support will be available very soon . <p> Sending and receiving updates via email can be used by both computers and mobile phones . To email an update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address associated with your Yammer account . For receiving Yammer messages via email , you can determine whether you want to receive all messages you are following or just messages addressed to you . <p> The Web Client , due to the fact that it offers every feature in one central location , is widely used . Through the web client you can : <p> Send and receive new updates <p> Reply to existing updates <p> View all feeds in message or threaded view <p> Follow tags and people <p> Search for tags , people , or keywords <p> Members , tags , and links directory <p> Profiles for each co-worker <p> Invite co-workers manually or through address book importer <p> All of the application listed above were developed internally by Yammer through the Yammer API . However , since Yammer recently opened it 's API developers platform , any developer can create additional applications . Therefore , you should expect to see many more variations of ways to send and receive Yammer updates , for you to choose from and use . @qwx171301 @qwx171306

@@12024999 @624999/ <h> Welcome to Yammer ! <p> By the Yammer team , on September 8 , 2008May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Welcome to Yammer , the micro-blogging tool for the enterprise . Stay tuned to this blog for all the latest Yammer news . Here is the press release from earlier today announcing our launch at TechCrunch50 : <p> Selected from among thousands of applicants , this " Enterprise 2.0 " startup allows companies and organizations to take advantage of a technology that has exploded in popularity among consumers on sites like Twitter . <p> On Yammer , co-workers exchange short frequent answers to one simple question : " What are you working on ? " <p> As employees answer this question , a company feed is created in one central location , enabling co-workers to discuss ideas , post news , ask questions , and share links and other information . <p> The company feed can be accessed in real-time via the web , IM , SMS text messaging , an iPhone application , a Blackberry application , a desktop application , or email . <p> Yammer also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profile and as a knowledge-base where past conversations are archived and easily searched . <p> Unlike traditional enterprise tools which must be installed by the companys IT department , anyone in a company can start their Yammer network and begin inviting colleagues . This means that Yammer can spread virally through a company like a consumer social network . <p> At the same time , Yammer ensures the privacy of each network by limiting access to those with a valid company email address . The model is similar to Facebooks beginnings as a college social network , when students had to validate a college email to join their college network . <p> The basic Yammer service is free , but companies can pay to claim and administer their networks . The cost is $1 per employee per month , after a free three-month trial period . <p> Companies who claim their network can configure their own security requirements by setting stricter password policies or restricting use to their office or VPN . These settings are also used on sites like Salesforce.com . <p> Yammer was originally developed at internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacks , the founder of Geni and Yammer , " We were looking for a tool to keep our company connected . Something like an enterprise version of Twitter would have been ideal , but it did n't  exist . So we built our own . " <p> Over time , the product evolved into a full-fledged company intranet / social network , adding features not available on consumer micro-blogging sites . " We have all worked at multiple companies and understand the needs of companies to share information within a private network . We had the luxury of building the solution that we wanted to use ourselves , " said Sacks . <p> Genis 30 employees used the product internally for six months , creating over 15,000 messages . Eventually Geni decided to spin out the product into a new entity so other companies could use it too . <p> Enterprise 2.0 <p> Yammer is part of the " Enterprise 2.0 " movement , which seeks to bring technologies popular with consumers into the workplace . <p> " People get to use great consumer internet sites , like Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal lives . Then , when they get to the office , all the software is antiquated and hard to use that does n't make sense . We want to do something about that , " said Sacks . <p> The solution is good for companies as well as employees . In 2007 , The New York Times described email as " a $650 Billion Drag on the Economy " , with email inboxes overflowing with unwanted messages . Meanwhile , people who need to see the information never get it . Yammer solves these problems by increasing communication while reducing email . <p> Increasingly , companies and organizations everywhere are finding that maintaining all of their applications on their own servers and by their own IT departments is not only costly and time consuming , but potentially disastrous if exceptional care is not taken in backups and security . The new generation of online enterprise applications , including Google Docs , Salesforce.com , and Yammer , solves this problem by remotely hosting software and data . <p> About Yammer : <p> Yammer is a tool for making companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one simple question : " What are you working on ? " <p> Yammer was founded by former PayPal COO David O. Sacks and officially launched on September 8 , 2008 .

@@12025002 @625002/ <p> Yammer aims to make workplace communication easier and better than ever before . It becomes challenging when you need to include all of your colleagues in important projects , discussions , and announcements , only to find that some of them have not yet joined Yammer . <p> With this in mind , we wanted to make it easy to involve people who are not yet on Yammer in conversations . We call them " pending users " . Pending users are people who fell out of the signup funnel , were invited by others but never joined , were added through Active Directory sync but never signed up themselves , and so on . Every app has " pending users " , but the relationship that active users have with pending users may vary . <p> So we decided to build functionality to allow our active users to mention pending users in Yammer posts . The pending user would then receive an email with the contents of the message and an invitation to join Yammer . To go into detail about the feature , let me explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goal <p> As mentioned , its important that our product helps you get work done with colleagues . Mentioning colleagues helps ensure your message reaches the right person and gets you a faster response . It also grows your Yammer network , which benefits from Metcalfes Law the idea that a network grows in value exponentially as each new member joins . This helps promote all of the other benefits that Yammer has to offer , like serendipitous discovery and more flexible collaboration . By extending these benefits to include pending users , we hoped to improve the experience for everyone . <h> Product Design <p> We worked hard to figure out what to change in the product . One variable is how to show pending users in the user typeahead ( the dropdown that appears when you start typing a name or @mention ) do we separate out pending users or do we integrate pending users into the list of active users to make the experience seamless ? <p> Integrated <p> - Separated <p> Another variable is the hovercard for pending users should we call out that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues with a chance to invite them ? <h> Caring for our Customers <p> We realized that some customers may be concerned about seeing people not yet on the Yammer network in the mentioning typeahead . But since the typeahead intentionally only includes trusted members of the company to ensure secure communication , we decided it was important to give users the opportunity to reach out to them through Yammer . <p> We also wanted to make sure that pending user mentioning did n't  come at the cost of active user mentioning or any other part of the Yammer experience . We kept an eye out for this during our experiment by measuring user behavior . We could tell with statistical significance whether or not mentioning pending users had any negative externalities , such as driving down active user mentions . <h> Experimentation <p> We had 4 combinations of the feature along with our experiment control . So we rolled out each version to 20% of the Yammer user base and collected data about what we care about : global metrics like engagement and virality , and the local metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrics . <p> Wow ! Data . We all had our own biases and hypotheses about which versions would perform well , which is one of many reasons why we leverage product experiments , and leverage data like what you see above . <h> Interpreting the Numbers <p> How does one make sense of all this ? The integrated typeahead with the existing user hovercard actually got us a 173% bump in pending user mentions compared to 163% for the integrated typeahead with the pending user hovercard , which ended up being our winner . <p> Why would we pick a variation that did n't  drive up pending user mentioning the most ? Well , consider the experience . In both groups , the user is seeing an integrated typeahead . So , the data suggests that the difference in the hovercards would somehow be responsible for the difference . That seemed implausible , so we trusted that the integrated typeahead was clearly better for pending user mentioning than the separated typeahead , which led to 123% and 106% increase in pending user mentions . Those gains are good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typeahead . <p> We also kept an eye out for effects on active user mentioning and posting . We found that people posted about 2% more threads with the integrated typeahead / pending user hovercard version . Also , as you see in the chart , this variation bumped active user mentioning by about 7% as opposed to just 4.6% with the other integrated typeahead or nothing at all with the separated typeahead . <p> And how do we explain not choosing the variation ( separated typeahead , pending user hovercard ) that may have yielded about a 2% bump in viral conversions ( new users that come through these mentions ) ? Well , for one , that variation meaningfully underperformed the other variations on other metrics we also care about . But it also may have hurt engagement and active user mentions , and those were costs that we would n't accept for the possible virality bump . <h> Moving Forward <p> Mentioning pending users has drastically reduced communication barriers within Yammer , and is available on all networks . We have data that gave us new insights on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will be using what we learned from this experiment to continue to design , build , and measure new product ideas that can further break barriers and unlock new workplace communication . <p> Have you tried the new mentioning pending users feature ?

Follow Diane on Twitter . <p> With 4,500 employees spanning more than 70 countries , the term " globally dispersed " is an understatement in our organization . Work groups are separated by time zones , product groups are divided by focus and international employees can be isolated by language . We share work with one another through a host of collaboration tools , but rarely could we put a face to an email address . <p> Yammer provides something our employees clearly needed : a personal connection to their colleagues and our business . Yammers adoption may have been viral and unexpected , but the reasons for its success are also clear : <p> ( Almost ) everybody is there . Nearly half our employee population is signed up with Yammer . Nowhere else within our business can you find engineers , administrative assistants , product marketing managers , IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . It just does n't  exist in our culturewe work , eat and socialize within our own micro networks , almost always based on job function . Yammer is introducing many of us to one another for the first time , creating a human network that defies geographic boundaries and cultural differences . <p> We have executive support . Two key executives in our organization , one being our CIO , really championed Yammer early on . They were super users before most employees had even heard of the service .

Social networking can be a tricky thing for businesses . There is a natural tendency to limit participation in the name of protecting intellectual property and keeping employees from becoming unproductive . Both are valid concernsbut our philosophy is that Yammer provides more value through connecting each other than can be found in " policing " the service . By trusting our employees , we create a comfortable place for them to engage and express themselves .

@@12025009 @625009/ <h> Social Etiquette Do Your Part To Manage Social Noise <p> By the Yammer team , on June 10 , 2011May 28 , 2015 0Shares <p> Information overload can be a serious , and oftentimes , paralyzing problem as most of us are using several social networks , feeds , blogs , etc ! The only way to manage this going forward is to create infallible filtering strategies that are scalable and adjustable to match the way your work and interests change . I believe there are 3 parts to successful filtering : your personal filters , algorithmic filters and community etiquette that help others easier find the brilliant nuggets that you share . In this post , we discussed effective following strategies and other things you can do to ensure that you are getting only whats relevant to you . Now its time to talk about how you share and establishing best practices to give you the highest return on your presence . We are going to focus this discussion on an enterprise social network like Yammer , but similar best practices can be extrapolated for consumer social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are three main buckets of reasons : <p> You have something brilliant to share that can help others . Its either an article you found , an article you wrote , or a tip / trick that can benefit others . <p> You are asking others for help by tapping into the " collective brain " . You may be crowdsourcing a solution , looking for an answer to a question , or proactively starting a conversation to enable others to show their brilliance ( see bucket 1 ) . <p> You are sharing something about yourself , what you do , how you feel about the world and what you think . The goal here is to help others get to know you , and encouraging others to share their thoughts in response . <p> Intent is important because it helps you determine the best vehicle to sharing which tool you will use and how you will structure your statement or query . At the end of the day , no one wants to throw stuff out into the " wild open , " praying for engagement you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing your target audience helps you understand where to post , what to post and how to best express yourself for the highest return on your sharing . <p> Posting public messages <p> Systems like Yammer have an open feed where employees ( in the case of a company network ) or community members ( in the case of an external network ) can share . Here , your message can reach the most people . Just like on Twitter or Facebook , its important to remember that people following you or following the groups to which you post the message , will get your message in their feed . Alternatively , someone can see your message if they go directly to the group to which you posted it . We do recommend doing that from time to time to maximize your " serendipity " of exposure to people you do n't  know yet . Anyone can see your message , but because Yammer is a stream , there 's always a chance that the intended recipients may miss it . If necessary , to maximize the chance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention them in the message . <p> Etiquette tip : be mindful of the volume and content of your messages . Ask yourself : is this going to benefit others ? Is it going to help people get to know me better ? If I share this information , is there someone else who may want to know this information ? Does this help drive our business forward ? If not , think twice about posting . You do n't  want to become so noisy that others stop following you . <p> Posting private messages <p> Posting in the public feed means that , well , your message is public . Its there for everyone to see . If you are n't  sure if something should be public , make it private ; this really goes for any social network out there be it Yammer , Facebook or Twitter . In Yammer private messages , you can talk to as many people as you need to , so do n't  feel like you have to make something public just so you can involve more than one person . Unlike Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exchange private messages . <p> Etiquette tip : The cool thing about Yammer messages is that you can bring in other people at a later point in the conversation just be mindful of the prior content in that message and ask yourself if that content can be seen by people you brought in later . <p> Using groups <p> If you want to share something narrow in focus , you should consider posting in a group. - On Yammer , groups are a great way for people to find- people to follow and get exposed to information . By joining a group , updates from that group publish to your My Feed automatically . You can even subscribe to group feeds via IM , email or text , making it a listserv of sort . <p> Etiquette tip : Please exercise your judgment when deciding if something is appropriate for groups or main feed . Keep in mind that everything you publish to a group automatically publishes to the feeds of everyone in the group . <p> Using taxonomy effectively <p> Taxonomy is basically the system of marking your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for example , you see symbols like @ and # in both Yammer and Twitter . In the context of an internal social network , you would most often use @ replies to draw someones name into a conversation , whether in a public thread or a comment to a public thread . Another example is a topic , which can be added by going to " more " under each thread or by using a #hashtag . This is similar to Twitter hashtags that have a similar organizing mission . If you post to particular topics , your posts will be easier to find for your intended audience . If you post with an @ name , you increase the likelihood of this person seeing it . <p> Etiquette tip : Please never abuse topics or hashtags . Because people follow them with an expectation to find relevant information , they are more likely to read your message . If its tagged incorrectly , it will annoy the reader and discredit you as a writer . Remember : no hashtag spam ! <p> Broadcasting your news <p> Specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement message to the whole network or to the group which they are an admin of . - An announcement appears in the feed of everyone following that group , and generates an email notification . Thus , it should be used sparingly for key notifications that should be shared with the whole organization or with a particular group of people . If you have news that 's important to you , ask yourself if its important to everyone else . Corporate communications like CEOs townhall , or a piece of crisis communication are definitely broadcast-worthy for most companies .. <p> Etiquette tip : Avoid sending more than one broadcast per week as a network prioritize what 's truly important .

@@12025012 @625012/ <h> Digital Natives , Dinosaurs and Immigrants <p> You are probably reading this blog because social media is part of your life . Perhaps you are reading it because you have a strong desire to learn , and even though you may not know all its ins and outs , you " get it " . We as humans tend to gravitate towards others just like us , so it often seems that everyone around us also " gets " social media . However , most people are still not as social media savvy as you are , and I 'd bet that most people in your company are n't  either . <p> Yet organizations are recognizing they need more than just a digital strategist or a community manager . Rather , they need to immerse their workforce in social media , and those at the top do n't  want to be left behind . Check out this video from Deloitte Australias CEO on why future CEOs need social media . <p> So how do you assist our senior leaders in genuinely embracing social media ? <p> I have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . <p> The most powerful way to get senior executives using social media is providing a practical , immediate benefit . <p> Go beyond showing and illustrating the value of social media. - Thats what blogs and social media conferences are for . <p> Instead , sit down one-on-one and assist in producing something that will help them today. - Its as simple as asking " What are you working on ? " Create a Group in Yammer that they will care about , instantly . <p> This gives a leader on their social media training wheels purpose and direction that theyll come back for when you 've left the room . <p> 2 . Reverse-mentoring <p> I came across the reverse-mentoring program at Deloitte , where it originated from a senior executives post on Yammer asking for help understanding social media . <p> " Digital natives " ( those being born in the internet age ) responded , willing to share their natural knowledge on the topic , and other senior leaders joined in to reply , also in need of help . <p> Graduates were educating top-level management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work . <p> Reverse mentoring has great rewards ; it harnesses the ( often untapped ) talent of rising stars , increases the organisations superconnectedness by forming unlikely relationships and exposes employees to areas of the company outside their normal daily routine . <p> Leaders from Deloitte posted their key learnings from the mentoring sessions on the Yammer network , and the mentors shared and collaborated on presentations between themselves via groups . <p> The legacy of keeping this online is a constantly updating bank of content on social etiquette for any employee to view. - From an initial call out , the reverse mentoring program has now completely refreshed Deloittes traditional mentoring program . <p> 3 . Peer-to-peer support . <p> Not all corporate cultures are open to the tech-whizz kid explaining social media to their CEO. - Speaking to a CEO , CTO , or department head in " their language " is often going to get stronger buy-in . If you cant get a senior leader to help explain the value of social media , as Deloitte has done with its series of videos from key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your own presentations . <p> Even a subtle inclusion of their contribution to a group , or post on Yammer , can drive home the fact that social media is not just a tech toy or a water-cooler conversation for the young kids , but absolutley necessary to their role . <p> Bearing in mind the hurdles of status , power and position , these are the three methods I generally keep in my toolbox to educate key leaders in using social media . <p> What do you use in your organization ? @qwx171301 @qwx171306

Post a question on Yammer and you 'll likely receive answers from people you did not expect . At every company , people have skills and expertise that go beyond their job descriptions , and Yammer helps people make connections based on what people know , not their job title . Your profile photo and summary are essential for helping solidify those serendipitous connections that are formed on Yammer . <p> Complete your Profile .

So , you like his message . You make a connection . You now know more about the people you work with , which makes working together better . <p> What to Say About Yourself <p> If you 're stumped on what to include in your profile summary , think about what you would want to know about your colleagues .

Its a pretty big mission , but we think its an important one . We believe that- an open workplace is a better workplacewhere more conversations happen in the open , sharing information between teams is the norm , and collaboration is constant . <p> So how does Yammer help companies do this ? Yammer is built to be open by default , making it easy for people to discover valuable information and connect with each other to get work done . Every individual holds a wealth of knowledge and experienceexpertise in a specific area , content they create , or learnings they have from previous projects . On Yammer , employees can share their ideas and gain visibility for the things they 're working on . When people get constant feedback and positive reinforcement , they are motivated not only to get work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also enables teams to work together across departments and geographies , so they can quickly align on projects and collaborate to achieve more . By having a common platform to discover information and connect with one another at any time , people are able to have conversations they otherwise wouldve never had . These are the conversations that spark ideas , eliminate duplication of work , and generally make people feel like what they 're doing is making an impact . <p> In the next few weeks , well dive deeper into how we 've built Yammers messaging system to be open , and how our customers have benefited from collaborating in the open .
